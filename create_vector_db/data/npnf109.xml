  <description>With over twenty volumes, the <i>Nicene and 
Post-Nicene Fathers</i> is a momentous achievement. Originally gathered 
by 
Philip Schaff, the <i>Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers</i> is a collection 
of 
writings by classical and medieval Christian theologians. The purpose of 
such a collection is to make their writings readily available. The 
entire work is divided into two series. The first series focuses on two 
classical Christian theologians--St. Augustine and St. John Chrysostom. 
St. Augustine is one of the most influential and important Christian 
thinkers of all time. In addition to reprinting his most popular two 
works--the <i>Confessions</i> and the <i>City of God</i>--these volumes 
also 
contain 
other noteworthy and important works of St. Augustine, such as <i>On the 
Holy Trinity</i>, <i>Christian Doctrine</i>, and others. St. John 
Chrysostom 
was an 
eloquent speaker and well-loved Christian clergyman. St. John took a 
more literal interpretation of Scripture, and much of his work focused 
on practical aspects of Christianity, particularly what is now called 
social justice. He advocated for the poor, and challenged abuses of 
authority. The <i>Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers</i> is comprehensive in 
scope, 
and provide keen translations of instructive and illuminating texts from 
some of the greatest theologians of the Christian church. These 
spiritually enlightening texts have aided Christians for over a thousand 
years, and remain instructive and fruitful even today!<br /><br />Tim

<p class="c7" id="ii-p2"><span class="c8" id="ii-p2.1">__________</span></p>

<p class="c9" id="ii-p3">With this volume, we begin the Works of St.
Chrysostom. It contains a sketch of his life and labors, the book
on the priesthood, the letters to Theodore, the catechetical
instructions, and a selection of ascetic treatises, special
homilies, letters to Olympias and Innocent, and the twenty-one
Homilies on the Statues.</p>

<p class="c10" id="ii-p4">The translations are entirely new, or thoroughly
revised, by the Rev. W. R. W. Stephens, whose services I was so
fortunate as to secure. He has written the best biography of St.
Chrysostom and is thoroughly at home in his writings. He has taken
great pains, with the aid of two friends, the Rev. T. P. Brandram
and Rev. R. Blackburn, and is responsible for the whole volume,
with the exception of the Prolegomena, which I wrote myself, to
correspond with the Prolegomena to the works of St. Augustin.</p>

<p class="c10" id="ii-p5">The other volumes of St. Chrysostom in this series
will be devoted to his exegetical Homilies on the greater part of
the New Testament.</p>

Opera omnia quæ exstant vel quæ ejus nomine circumferuntur, ad
<span class="c12" id="iii.i-p8.2">mss.</span> codices Gallicos, Vaticanos,
Anglicos, Germanicosque castigata, etc. Opera et studio D.</i><span class="c12" id="iii.i-p8.3">Bernardi de Montfaucon</span>, <i>monachi ordinis S.
Benedicti e congregatione S. Mauri, opem ferentibus aliis ex codem
sodalitio, monachis</i>. Greek and Latin, Paris, 1718–’38, in
13 vols., fol. This is the best edition, and the result of about
twenty years of the patient labor of Montfaucon (d. Dec. 21, 1741,
86 years old), and several assistants of the brotherhood of St.
Maur. More than three hundred <span class="c12" id="iii.i-p8.4">mss.</span> were
made use of, but the eight principal <span class="c12" id="iii.i-p8.5">mss.</span>,
as Field has shown, were not very carefully collated. Montfaucon,
who at the date of the completion of his edition was 83 years old,
prepared valuable prefaces to every treatise and set of homilies,
arranged the works in chronological order, and added in vol. XIII.
learned dissertations on the life, doctrine, discipline and
heresies of the age of Chrysostom.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.i-p9">The Benedictine edition was reprinted at
Venice, 1734–’41, in 13 vols. fol.; at Paris, ed. by <span class="c12" id="iii.i-p9.1">F. de Sinner (Gaume)</span>, 1834–’39, in 13 vols.
(an elegant edition, with some additions); and, with various
improvements and corrections, by <span class="c12" id="iii.i-p9.2">J. P.
Migne</span>, Petit-Montrouge, 1859–’63, in 13 vols. The last
is the most complete edition, but inferior in paper and type to
that of Gaume. Migne uses the critical text of Field in Matthew and
the Pauline Epp. He had previously edited a Latin Version, 1842, in
9 vols.</p>

and great preacher.”</p></note></p>

commentator of the Greek Church, and still deservedly enjoys the
highest honor in the whole Christian world. No one of the Oriental
Fathers has left a more spotless reputation; no one is so much read
and so often quoted by modern preachers and commentators. An
admiring posterity, since the close of the fifth century, has given
him the surname <span class="c12" id="iii.ii-p5.4">Chrysostom (the Golden
Mouth)</span>, which has entirely superseded his personal name
<span class="c12" id="iii.ii-p5.5">John</span>, and which best expresses the general

<p class="c10" id="iii.ii-p6">His life may be divided into five periods: (1) His
youth and training till his conversion and baptism, A.D. 347–370.
(2) His ascetic and monastic life, 370–381. (3) His public life

Villemain</span> assigns the year 344 as that of his
birth.</p></note> at Antioch, the
capital of Syria, and the home of the mother church of Gentile
Christianity, where the disciples of Jesus were first called
“Christians.”</p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.ii-p9">His father, Secundus, was a distinguished
military officer (<i>magister militum</i>) in the imperial army of
Syria, and died during the infancy of John, without professing
Christianity, as far as we know. His mother, Anthusa, was a rare
woman. Left a widow at the age of twenty, she refused all offers of
marriage, and devoted herself exclusively to the education of her
only son and his older sister. She was probably from principle
averse to a second marriage, according to a prevailing view of the
Fathers. She shines, with Nonna and Monica, among the most pious
mothers of the fourth century, who prove the ennobling influence of
Christianity on the character of woman, and through her on all the
family relations. Anthusa gained general esteem by her exemplary
life. The famous advocate of heathenism, Libanius, on hearing of
her consistency and devotion, felt constrained to exclaim: “Bless
me! what wonderful women there are among the Christians.”<note place="end" n="3" id="iii.ii-p9.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.ii-p10">
Βαβαὶ, οἷαι παρὰ χριστιανοῖς γυναῖκ™ς
εἰσι. Chrysostom himself relates this of his heathen
teacher (by whom, undoubtedly, we are to understand Libanius),
though, it is true, with immediate reference only to the twenty
years’ widowhood of his mother, and adds: “Such is the praise
and admiration of widowhood not only with us, but even with the
heathen.” <i>Ad viduam juniorem</i> (<i>Opera</i>, Bened. ed.
Tom. i. 340; in <span class="c12" id="iii.ii-p10.1">Migne’s</span> ed. Tom. i., P.
II., 601).</p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.ii-p11">She gave her son an admirable education, and early
planted in his soul the germs of piety, which afterwards bore the
richest fruits for himself and the church. By her admonitions and
the teachings of the Bible, he was secured against the seductions
of heathenism.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.ii-p12"><pb n="6" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_6.html" id="iii.ii-Page_6" />Yet he was not
baptized till he had reached the age of maturity. In that age of
transition from heathenism to Christianity, the number of adult
baptisms far exceeded that of infant baptisms. Hence the large
baptisteries for the baptism of crowds of converts; hence the many
sermons and lectures of Chrysostom, Cyril of Jerusalem and other
preachers to catechumens, and their careful instruction before
baptism and admission to the Missa Fidelium or the holy communion.
Even Christian parents, as the father and mother of Gregory
Nazianzen, the mother of Chrysostom, and the mother of Augustin,
put off the baptism of their offspring, partly no doubt from a very
high conception of baptism as the sacrament of regeneration, and
the superstitious fear that early baptism involved the risk of a
forfeiture of baptismal grace. This was the argument which
Tertullian in the second century urged against infant baptism, and
this was the reason why many professing Christians put off their
baptism till the latest hour; just as now so many from the same
motive delay repentance and conversion to their death-bed.
Chrysostom often rebukes that custom. The Emperor Constantine who
favored Christianity as early as 312, and convened the Council of
Nicæa in 325, postponed baptism till 337, shortly before his
death. The orthodox Emperor Theodosius the Great was not baptized
till the first year of his reign (380), when attacked by a serious
illness.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.ii-p13">Chrysostom received his literary training
chiefly from Libanius, the admirer and friend of Julian the
Apostate, and the first classical scholar and rhetorician of his
age, who after a long career as public teacher at Athens and
Constantinople, returned to his native Antioch and had the
misfortune to outlive the revival of heathenism under Julian and to
lament the triumph of Christianity under his successors. He was
introduced by him into a knowledge of the Greek classics and the
arts of rhetoric, which served him a good purpose for his future
labors in the church. He was his best scholar, and when Libanius,
shortly before his death (about 393), was asked whom he wished for
his successor, he replied: “John, if only the Christians had not
stolen him from us.”<note place="end" n="4" id="iii.ii-p13.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.ii-p14">

<p class="c10" id="iii.ii-p15">After the completion of his studies Chrysostom
became a rhetorician, and began the profitable practice of law,
which opened to him a brilliant political career. The amount of
litigation was enormous. The display of talent in the law-courts
was the high-road to the dignities of vice-prefect, prefect, and
consul. Some of his speeches at the bar excited admiration and were
highly commended by Libanius. For some time, as he says, he was
“a never-failing attendant at the courts of law, and passionately
fond of the theatre.” But he was not satisfied. The temptations
of a secular profession in a corrupt state of society discouraged
him. To accept a fee for making the worse cause appear the better
cause, seemed to him to be taking Satan’s wages.</p>

his character.<note place="end" n="5" id="iii.iii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.iii-p3">

<p class="c10" id="iii.iii-p4">He entered the class of catechumens, and after the
usual period of three years of instruction and probation, he was
baptized by Meletius in his twenty-third year (369 or 370). From
this time on, says Palladius, “he neither swore, nor defamed any
one, nor spoke falsely, nor cursed, nor even tolerated facetious
jokes.” His baptism was, as in the case of St. Augustin, the
turning point in his life, an entire renunciation of this world and
dedication to the service of Christ. The change was radical and
permanent.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.iii-p5">Meletius, who foresaw the future greatness of the
young lawyer, wished to secure him for 
<pb n="7" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_7.html" id="iii.iii-Page_7" />the active service of the church, and ordained
him to the subordinate office of rector (<i>anagnostes</i>, 
reader), about A.D. 370. The rectors
had to read the Scripture lessons in the first part of divine
service (the “Missa Catechumenorum”), and to call upon the
people to pray, but could not preach nor distribute the
sacraments.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.iii-p6">The first inclination of Chrysostom after
baptism was to adopt the monastic life as the safest mode,
according to the prevailing notions of the church in that age, to
escape the temptations and corruptions of the world, to cultivate
holiness and to secure the salvation of the soul. But the earnest
entreaties of his mother prevailed on him to delay the
gratification of his desire. He relates the scene with dramatic
power. She took him to her chamber, and by the bed where she had
given him birth, she adjured him with tears not to forsake her.
“My son,” she said in substance, “my only comfort in the
midst of the miseries of this earthly life is to see thee
constantly, and to behold in thy features the faithful image of my
beloved husband who is no more. This comfort commenced with your
infancy before you could speak. I ask only one favor from you: do
not make me a widow a second time; wait at least till I die;
perhaps I shall soon leave this world. When you have buried me and
joined my ashes with those of your father, nothing will then
prevent you from retiring into monastic life. But as long as I
breathe, support me by your presence, and do not draw down upon you
the wrath of God by bringing such evils upon me who have given you
no offense.”<note place="end" n="6" id="iii.iii-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.iii-p7">
<i>De Sacerd</i>. I. 5.</p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.iii-p8">These tender, simple and impressive words suggest
many heart-rending scenes caused by the ascetic enthusiasm for
separation from the sacred ties of the family. It is honorable to
Chrysostom that he yielded to the reasonable wishes of his devoted
mother. He remained at home, but turned his home into a monastery.
He secluded himself from the world and practiced a rigid
asceticism. He ate little and seldom, and only the plainest food,
slept on the bare floor and frequently rose to prayer. He kept
almost unbroken silence to prevent a relapse into the habit of
slander.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.iii-p9">His former associates at the bar called him
unsociable and morose. But two of his fellow-pupils under Libanius
joined him in his ascetic life, Maximus (afterwards bishop of
Seleucia), and Theodore of Mopsuestia. They studied the Scriptures
under the direction of Diodorus (afterwards bishop of Tarsus), the
founder of the Antiochian school of theology, of which Chrysostom
and Theodore became the chief ornaments.<note place="end" n="7" id="iii.iii-p9.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.iii-p10">

abbots under whom Chrysostom lived as monk, but <span class="c12" id="iii.iii-p10.1">
Neander</span> (in the 3d ed. I. 29) thinks it more likely that
Chrysostom was previously instructed by Diodor at
Antioch.</p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.iii-p11">Theodore was warmly attached to a young lady
named Hermione, and resolved to marry and to leave the ascetic
brotherhood. This gave rise to the earliest treatise of
Chrysostom—namely, an exhortation to Theodore, in two letters.<note place="end" n="8" id="iii.iii-p11.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.iii-p12">
<i>Parænesis ad Theodorum Lapsum</i>, in <span class="c12" id="iii.iii-p12.1">
Migne’s</span> ed. I., Pars I. 277–319. The second letter is
milder than the first, and was written earlier. It is somewhat
doubtful whether the first refers to the same case. <span class="c12" id="iii.iii-p12.2">Neander</span> (I. 38 sq.) conjectures that the second
only is addressed to Theodore.</p></note> He plied all his oratorical arts of
sad sympathy, tender entreaty, bitter reproach, and terrible
warning, to reclaim his friend to what he thought the surest and
safest way to heaven. To sin, he says, is human, but to persist in
sin is devilish; to fall is not ruinous to the soul, but to remain
on the ground is. The appeal had its desired effect; Theodore
resumed his monastic life and became afterwards bishop of
Mopsuestia in Cilicia and one of the first biblical scholars. The
arguments which Chrysostom used, would condemn all who broke their
monastic vows. They retain moral force only if we substitute
apostasy from faith for apostasy from monasticism, which must be
regarded as a temporary and abnormal or exceptional form of
Christian life.</p>

IV</span><span class="c1" id="iii.iv-p1.2">.—<i>Chrysostom Evades Election to a
Bishopric, and Writes His Work on the Priesthood.</i></span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.iv-p2">About this time several bishoprics were vacant in
Syria, and frequent depositions took 
<pb n="8" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_8.html" id="iii.iv-Page_8" />place with the changing fortunes of orthodoxy and
Arianism, and the interference of the court. The attention of the
clergy and the people turned to Chrysostom and his friend Basil as
suitable candidates for the episcopal office, although they had not
the canonical age of thirty. Chrysostom shrunk from the
responsibilities and avoided an election by a pious fraud. He
apparently assented to an agreement with Basil that both should
either accept, or resist the burden of the episcopate, but instead
of that he concealed himself and put forward his friend whom he
accounted much more worthy of the honor. Basil, under the
impression that Chrysostom had already been consecrated,
reluctantly submitted to the election. When he discovered the
cheat, he upbraided his friend with the breach of compact, but
Chrysostom laughed and rejoiced at the success of his plot. This
conduct, which every sound Christian conscience must condemn,
caused no offense among the Christians of that age, still less
among the heathen, and was regarded as good management or
“economy.” The moral character of the deception was supposed to
depend altogether on the motive, which made it good or bad.
Chrysostom appealed in justification of laudable deception to the
stratagems of war, the conduct of physicians in dealing with
refractory patients, to several examples of the Old Testament
(Abraham, Jacob, David), and to the conduct of the Apostle Paul in
circumcising Timothy for the sake of the Jews (<scripRef passage="Acts xvi. 3" id="iii.iv-p2.1" parsed="|Acts|16|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.16.3">Acts xvi. 3</scripRef>) and in observing the
ceremonial law in Jerusalem at the advice of James (<scripRef passage="Acts xxi. 26" id="iii.iv-p2.2" parsed="|Acts|21|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.21.26">Acts xxi. 26</scripRef>).</p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.iv-p3">The Jesuitical maxim, “the end justifies the
means,” is much older than Jesuitism, and runs through the whole
apocryphal, pseudo-prophetic, pseudo-apostolic, pseudo-Clementine
and pseudo-Isidorian literature of the early centuries. Several of
the best Fathers show a surprising want of a strict sense of
veracity. They introduce a sort of cheat even into their strange
theory of redemption, by supposing that the Devil caused the
crucifixion under the delusion that Christ was a mere man, and thus
lost his claim upon the fallen race. Origen, Chrysostom, and Jerome
explain the offense of the collision between Paul and Peter at
Antioch (<scripRef passage="Gal. ii. 11" id="iii.iv-p3.1" parsed="|Gal|2|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gal.2.11">Gal. ii. 11</scripRef> sqq.) away by turning it
into a theatrical and hypocritical farce, which was shrewdly
arranged by the two apostles for the purpose of convincing the
Jewish Christians that circumcision was not necessary. Against such
wretched exegesis the superior moral sense of Augustin rightly
protested, and Jerome changed his view on this particular passage.
Here is a point where the modern standard of ethics is far superior
to that of the Fathers, and more fully accords with the spirit of
the New Testament, which inculcates the strictest veracity as a
fundamental virtue.<note place="end" n="9" id="iii.iv-p3.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.iv-p4">

<p class="c10" id="iii.iv-p5">The escape from the episcopate was the
occasion for one of the best and most popular works of Chrysostom,
the Six Books <i>On the Priesthood</i>, which he wrote probably
before his ordination (between 375 and 381), or during his
diaconate (between 381 and 386). It is composed in the form of a
Platonic dialogue between Chrysostom and Basil. He first vindicates
by argument and examples his well-meant but untruthful conduct
towards his friend, and the advantages of timely fraud; and then
describes with youthful fervor and eloquence the importance, duties
and trials of the Christian ministry, without distinguishing
between the priestly and the episcopal office. He elevates it above
all other offices. He requires whole-souled consecration to Christ
and love to his flock. He points to the Scriptures (quoting also
from the Apocrypha) as the great weapon of the minister. He
assumes, as may be expected, the then prevailing conception of a
real priesthood and sacrifice, baptismal regeneration, the corporal
presence, the virtue of absolution, prayers for the dead, but is
silent about pope and councils, the orders of the clergy, prayers
to saints, forms of prayer, priestly vestments, incense, crosses
and other doctrines and ceremonies of the Greek and Roman
churches. <pb n="9" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_9.html" id="iii.iv-Page_9" />He holds up
St. Paul as a model for imitation. The sole object of the preacher
must be to please God rather than men (<scripRef passage="Gal. i. 10" id="iii.iv-p5.1" parsed="|Gal|1|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gal.1.10">Gal. i. 10</scripRef>). “He must not indeed
despise approving demonstrations, but as little must he court them,
nor trouble himself when they are withheld.” He should combine
the qualities of dignity and humility, authority and sociability,
impartiality and courtesy, independence and lowliness, strength and
gentleness, and keep a single eye to the glory of Christ and the
welfare of the church.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.iv-p6">This book is the most useful or at least the best
known among the works of Chrysostom, and is well calculated to
inspire a profound sense of the tremendous responsibilities of the
ministry. But it has serious defects, besides the objectionable
justification of pious fraud, and cannot satisfy the demands of an
evangelical minister. In all that pertains to the proper care of
souls it is inferior to the “Reformed Pastor” of Richard
Baxter.</p>

Monk. <span class="c12" id="iii.v-p1.3">a.d.</span> 374–381.</i></span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.v-p2">After the death of his mother, Chrysostom fled
from the seductions and tumults of city life to the monastic
solitude of the mountains south of Antioch, and there spent six
happy years in theological study and sacred meditation and prayer.
Monasticism was to him (as to many other great teachers of the
church, and even to Luther) a profitable school of spiritual
experience and self-government. He embraced this mode of life as
“the true philosophy” from the purest motives, and brought into
it intellect and cultivation enough to make the seclusion available
for moral and spiritual growth.<note place="end" n="10" id="iii.v-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.v-p3">
On the origin and character of early monasticism, see <span class="c12" id="iii.v-p3.1">Schaff</span>, <i>Ch. Hist</i>. vol. III., 147
sqq.</p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.v-p4">He gives us a lively description of the bright side
of this monastic life. The monks lived in separate cells or huts
(<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.v-p4.1">κ€λυβαι</span>), but according to a
common rule and under the authority of an abbot. They wore coarse
garments of camel’s hair or goat’s hair over their linen
tunics. They rose before sunrise, and began the day by singing a
hymn of praise and common prayer under the leadership of the abbot.
Then they went to their allotted task, some to read, others to
write, others to manual labor for the support of the poor. Four
hours in each day were devoted to prayer and singing. Their only
food was bread and water, except in case of sickness. They slept on
straw couches, free from care and anxiety. There was no need of
bolts and bars. They held all things in common, and the words of
“mine and thine,” which cause innumerable strifes in the world,
were unknown among the brethren. If one died, he caused no
lamentation, but thanksgiving, and was carried to the grave amidst
hymns of praise; for he was not dead, but “perfected,” and
permitted to behold the face of Christ. For them to live was
Christ, and to die was gain.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.v-p5">Chrysostom was an admirer of active and useful
monasticism, and warns against the dangers of idle contemplation.
He shows that the words of our Lord, “One thing is needful;”
“Take no anxious thought for the morrow;” “Labor not for the
meat that perisheth,” do not inculcate total abstinence from
work, but only undue anxiety about worldly things, and must be
harmonized with the apostolic exhortation to labor and to do good.
He defends monastic seclusion on account of the prevailing
immorality in the cities, which made it almost impossible to
cultivate there a higher Christian life.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.v-p6">In this period, from 374 to 381, Chrysostom
composed his earliest writings in praise of monasticism and
celibacy.<note place="end" n="11" id="iii.v-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.v-p7">

“to the fallen Theodore,” have already been mentioned. The
three books against the Opponents of Monasticism were occasioned by
a decree of the Arian Emperor Valens in 373, which aimed at the
destruction of that system and compelled the monks to discharge
their duties to the state by military or civil service. Chrysostom
regarded this decree as a sacrilege, and the worst kind of
persecution.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.vi-p2">By excessive self-mortifications John undermined his
health, and returned to Antioch. There he was immediately ordained
deacon by Meletius in 380 or 381, and a few years afterwards
presbyter by Flavian (386).</p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.vi-p3">As deacon he had the best opportunity to
become acquainted with the practical needs of the population, the
care of the poor and the sick. After his ordination to the
priesthood he preached in the presence of the bishop his first
sermon to a vast crowd. It abounds in flowery Asiatic eloquence, in
humble confession of his own unworthiness, and exaggerated praise
of Meletius and Flavian.<note place="end" n="12" id="iii.vi-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.vi-p4">
<span class="c12" id="iii.vi-p4.1">Migne</span>, III. 693 sqq.</p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.vi-p5">He now entered upon a large field of usefulness, the
real work of his life. The pulpit was his throne, and he adorned it
as much as any preacher of ancient or modern times.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.vi-p6">Antioch was one of the great capitals of the Roman
empire along with Alexandria, Constantinople, and Rome. Nature and
art combined to make it a delightful residence, though it was often
visited by inundations and earthquakes. An abundance of pure water
from the river Orontes, a large lake and the surrounding hills,
fertile plains, the commerce of the sea, imposing buildings of
Asiatic, Greek, and Roman architecture, rich gardens, baths, and
colonnaded streets, were among its chief attractions. A broad
street of four miles, built by Antiochus Epiphanes, traversed the
city from east to west; the spacious colonnades on either side were
paved with red granite. Innumerable lanterns illuminated the main
thoroughfares at night. The city was supplied with good schools and
several churches; the greatest of them, in which Chrysostom
preached, was begun by the Emperor Constantine and finished by
Constantius. The inhabitants were Syrians, Greeks, Jews, and
Romans. The Asiatic element prevailed. The whole population
amounted, as Chrysostom states, to 200,000, of whom one half were
nominally Christians. Heathenism was therefore still powerful as to
numbers, but as a religion it had lost all vitality. This was shown
by the failure of the attempt of the Emperor Julian the Apostate to
revive the sacrifices to the gods. When he endeavored in 362 to
restore the oracle of Apollo Daphneus in the famous cypress grove
at Antioch and arranged for a magnificent procession, with
libation, dances, and incense, he found in the temple one solitary
old priest, and this priest ominously offered in sacrifice—a
goose! Julian himself relates this ludicrous farce, and vents his
anger at the Antiochians for squandering the rich incomes of the
temple upon Christianity and worldly amusements.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.vi-p7">Chrysostom gives us in his sermons lively
pictures of the character of the people and the condition of the
church. The prevailing vices even among Christians were avarice,
luxury, sensuality, and excessive love of the circus and the
theatre. “So great,” he says, “is the depravity of the times,
that if a stranger were to compare the precepts of the gospel with
the actual practice of society, he would infer that men were not
the disciples, but the enemies of Christ.” Gibbon thus describes
the morals of Antioch:<note place="end" n="13" id="iii.vi-p7.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.vi-p8">
<i>Decline and Fall</i>, ch. xxiv.</p></note>
“The warmth of the climate disposed the natives to the most
intemperate enjoyment of tranquility and opulence, and the lively
licentiousness of the Greeks was blended with the hereditary
softness of the Syrians. Fashion was the only law, pleasure the
only pursuit, and the splendor of dress and furniture was the only
distinction of the citizens of Antioch. The arts of luxury were
honored, the serious and manly virtues were the subject of
ridicule, and the contempt for female modesty and reverent age
announced the universal corruption of the capital of the East. The
love of spectacles was the taste, or rather passion of the Syrians;
the most skilful artists were procured from the adjacent cities. A
considerable share of the revenue was devoted to the public
amusements, and the magnificence of the games of the theatre and
circus was considered as the happiness and as the glory of
Antioch.”</p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.vi-p9"><pb n="11" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_11.html" id="iii.vi-Page_11" />The church of
Antioch was rent for eighty-five years (330–415) by heresy and
schism. There were three parties and as many rival bishops. The
Meletians, under the lead of Meletius, were the party of moderate
orthodoxy holding the Nicene Creed; the Arians, headed by Eudoxius,
and supported by the Emperor Valens, denied the eternal divinity of
Christ; the Eustathians, under the venerated priest Paulinus, were
in communion with Athanasius, but were accused of Sabellianism,
which maintained the Divine unity and strict deity of Christ and
the Holy Spirit, but denied the tri-personality except in the form
of three modes of self-revelation. Pope Damasus declared for
Paulinus and condemned Meletius as a heretic. Alexandria likewise
sided against him. Meletius was more than once banished from his
see, and recalled. He died during the sessions of the Council of
Constantinople, 381, over which he presided for a while. His
remains were carried with great solemnities to Antioch and buried
by the side of Babylas the Martyr. Chrysostom reconciled Flavian,
the successor of Meletius, with Alexandria and Rome in 398.
Alexander, the successor of Flavian, led the Eustathians back into
the orthodox church in 415, and thus unity was restored.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.vi-p10">Chrysostom preached Sunday after Sunday and during
Lent, sometimes twice or oftener during the week, even five days in
succession, on the duties and responsibilities of Christians, and
fearlessly attacked the immorality of the city. He declaimed with
special severity against the theatre and the chariot-races; and yet
many of his hearers would run from his sermons to the circus to
witness those exciting spectacles with the same eagerness as Jews
and Gentiles. He exemplified his preaching by a blameless life, and
soon acquired great reputation and won the love of the whole
congregation. Whenever he preached the church was crowded. He had
to warn his hearers against pickpockets, who found an inviting
harvest in these dense audiences.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.vi-p11">A serious disturbance which took place during his
career at Antioch, called forth a remarkable effort of his
oratorical powers. The populace of the city, provoked by excessive
taxes, rose in revolt against the Emperor Theodosius the Great,
broke down his statues and those of his deceased excellent wife
Flacilla (d. 385) and his son Arcadius, dragged the fragments
through the streets, and committed other acts of violence. The
Emperor threatened to destroy the whole city. This caused general
consternation and agony, but the city was saved by the intercession
of Bishop Flavian, who in his old age proceeded to Constantinople
and secured free pardon from the Emperor. Although a man of violent
temper, Theodosius had profound reverence for bishops, and on
another occasion he submitted to the rebuke of St. Ambrose for the
wholesale massacre of the Thessalonians (390).</p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.vi-p12">In this period of public anxiety, which lasted
several months, Chrysostom delivered series of extempore orations,
in which he comforted the people and exhorted them to correct their
vices. These are his twenty-one <i>Homilies on the Statues</i>,
so-called from the overthrow of the imperial statues which gave
rise to them. They were preached during Lent 387.<note place="end" n="14" id="iii.vi-p12.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.vi-p13">
Montfaucon goes with tedious minuteness into the chronology of
these sermons. The twentieth was delivered ten days before Easter,
the twenty-first on Easter, after the return of Flavian from Rome
with the Emperor’s pardon. The first sermon was preached shortly
before the sedition and has nothing to do with it, but is alluded
to in the second. It is a temperance sermon, based on Paul’s
advice to Timothy, <scripRef passage="1 Tim. v. 23" id="iii.vi-p13.1" parsed="|1Tim|5|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.5.23">1 Tim.
v. 23</scripRef>, where he
emphasized the word “<i>little</i>” and the “often <i>
infirmities</i>.”</p></note> In the same year St. Augustin
submitted to baptism at the hands of St. Ambrose in Milan. One of
the results of those sermons was the conversion of a large number
of heathens. Thus the calamity was turned into a blessing to the
church.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.vi-p14">During the sixteen or seventeen years of his labors
in Antioch Chrysostom wrote the greater part of his Homilies and
Commentaries; a consolatory Epistle to the despondent Stagirius;
the excellent book on the martyr Babylas, which illustrates by a
striking example the divine power of Christianity; a treatise on
Virginity, which he puts above marriage; and an admonition to a
young widow on the glory of widowhood, and the duty of continuing
in it. <pb n="12" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_12.html" id="iii.vi-Page_12" />He disapproved of
second marriage, not as sinful or illegal, but as inconsistent with

<p class="c10" id="iii.vii-p2">After the death of Nectarius (successor to Gregory
Nazianzen), towards the end of the year 397, Chrysostom was chosen,
entirely without his own agency and even against his remonstrance,
archbishop of Constantinople. He was hurried away from Antioch by a
military escort, to avoid a commotion in the congregation and to
make resistance useless. He was consecrated Feb. 26, 398, by his
enemy Theophilus, patriarch of Alexandria, who reluctantly yielded
to the command of the Emperor Arcadius or rather his prime
minister, the eunuch Eutropius, and nursed his revenge for a more
convenient season.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.vii-p3">Constantinople, built by Constantine the Great in
330, on the site of Byzantium, assumed as the Eastern capital of
the Roman empire the first position among the episcopal sees of the
East, and became the centre of court theology, court intrigues, and
theological controversies. The second œcumenical council, which
was held there in 381, under Theodosius the Great, the last Roman
emperor worthy of the name (d. 395), decided the victory of Nicene
orthodoxy over the Arian heresy, and gave the bishop of
Constantinople a primacy of honor, next in rank to the bishop of
old Rome—a position which was afterwards confirmed by the Council
of Chalcedon in 451, but disputed by Pope Leo and his
successors.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.vii-p4">Chrysostom soon gained by his eloquent sermons the
admiration of the people, of the weak Emperor Arcadius, and, at
first, even of his wife Eudoxia, with whom he afterwards waged a
deadly war. He extended his pastoral care to the Goths who were
becoming numerous in Constantinople, had a part of the Bible
translated for them, often preached to them himself through an
interpreter, and sent missionaries to the Gothic and Scythian
tribes on the Danube. He continued to direct by correspondence
those missionary operations even during his exile. For a short time
he enjoyed the height of power and popularity.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.vii-p5">But he also made enemies by his denunciations
of the vices and follies of the clergy and aristocracy. He emptied
the episcopal palace of its costly plate and furniture and sold it
for the benefit of the poor and the hospitals. He introduced his
strict ascetic habits and reduced the luxurious household of his
predecessors to the strictest simplicity. He devoted his large
income to benevolence. He refused invitations to banquets, gave no
dinner parties, and ate the simplest fare in his solitary
chamber.<note place="end" n="16" id="iii.vii-p5.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.vii-p6">
<span class="c12" id="iii.vii-p6.1">Socrates</span> (VI. 5) says that some justified
this habit by his delicate stomach and weak digestion, others
attributed it to his rigid abstinence. His enemies construed it as
pride, and based upon it a serious accusation.</p></note> He denounced
unsparingly luxurious habits in eating and dressing, and enjoined
upon the rich the duty of almsgiving to an extent that tended to
increase rather than diminish the number of beggars who swarmed in
the streets and around the churches and public baths. He
disciplined the vicious clergy and opposed the perilous and immoral
habit of unmarried priests of living under the same roof with
“spiritual Sisters” (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.vii-p6.2">συνείσακται</span>). This habit dated from an earlier
age, and was a reaction against celibacy. Cyprian had raised his
protest against it, and the Council of Nicæa forbade unmarried
priests to live with any females except close relations.
Chrysostom’s unpopularity was increased by his irritability and
obstinacy, and his subservience to a proud and violent archdeacon,
Serapion. The Empress Eudoxia was jealous of his influence over
Arcadius and angry at his uncompromising severity against sin and
vice. She became the chief instrument of his downfall.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.vii-p7">The occasion was furnished by an unauthorized use of
his episcopal power beyond the lines of his diocese, which was
confined to the city. At the request of the clergy of Ephesus and
the neighboring bishops, he visited that city in January, 401, held
a synod and deposed six bishops convicted of shameful simony.
During his absence of several months he left the 
<pb n="13" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_13.html" id="iii.vii-Page_13" />episcopate of Constantinople in the hands of
Severian, bishop of Gabala, an unworthy and adroit flatterer, who
basely betrayed his trust and formed a cabal headed by the empress
and her licentious court ladies, for the ruin of Chrysostom. On his
return he used unguarded language in the pulpit, and spoke on
Elijah’s relation to Jezebel in such a manner that Eudoxia
understood it as a personal insult. The clergy were anxious to get
rid of a bishop who was too severe for their lax morals.</p>

and Banishment.</i></span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.viii-p2">At this time Chrysostom became involved in the
Origenistic controversies which are among the most violent and most
useless in ancient church history, and full of personal invective
and calumny.<note place="end" n="17" id="iii.viii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.viii-p3">
<span class="c12" id="iii.viii-p3.1">Schaff</span>, <i>Church History</i>, III.
698 sqq.</p></note> The object in
dispute was the orthodoxy of the great Origen, which long after his
death was violently defended and as violently assailed.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.viii-p4">Theophilus of Alexandria, an able and vigorous but
domineering, contentious and unscrupulous prelate, was at first an
admirer of Origen, but afterwards in consequence of a personal
quarrel joined the opponents, condemned his memory and banished the
Origenistic monks from Egypt. Some fifty of them, including the
four “Tall Brethren,” so-called on account of their
extraordinary stature, fled to Constantinople and were hospitably
received by Chrysostom (401). He had no sympathy with the
philosophical speculations of Origen, but appreciated his great
merits, and felt that injustice was done to the persecuted monks.
He interceded in their behalf with Theophilus, who replied with
indignant remonstrance against protecting heretics and interfering
in another diocese.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.viii-p5">Theophilus, long desirous of overthrowing
Chrysostom, whom he had reluctantly consecrated, set every
instrument in motion to take revenge. He sent the octogenarian
bishop Epiphanius of Salamis, a well-meaning and learned but
bigoted zealot for orthodoxy, to Constantinople, as a tool of his
hierarchical plans (402); but Epiphanius soon returned and died on
the ship (403). Theophilus now traveled himself to Constantinople,
accompanied by a body-guard of rough sailors and provided with
splendid presents. He appeared at once as accuser and judge, aided
by Eudoxia and the disaffected clergy. He held a secret council of
thirty-six bishops, all of them Egyptians except seven, in a suburb
of Chalcedon on the Asiatic side of the Bosphorus, and procured in
this so-called synod at the Oak, the deposition and banishment of
Chrysostom, on false charges of immorality and high treason (403).
Among the twenty-nine charges were these: that Chrysostom had
called the saintly Epiphanius a fool and a demon, that he abused
the clergy, that he received females without witnesses, that he ate
sumptuously alone and bathed alone, that he had compared the
empress to Jezebel.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.viii-p6">The innocent bishop refused to appear before a
packed synod of his enemies, and appealed to a general council. As
the sentence of banishment for life became known, the indignation
of the people was immense. A single word from him would have raised
an insurrection; but he surrendered himself freely to the imperial
officers, who conveyed him in the dark to the harbor and put him on
board a ship destined for Hieron at the mouth of the Pontus.
Theophilus entered the city in triumph and took vengeance on
Chrysostom’s friends.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.viii-p7">The people besieged the palace and demanded the
restoration of their bishop. Constantinople was almost in a state
of insurrection. The following night the city was convulsed by an
earthquake, which was felt with peculiar violence in the bedroom of
Eudoxia and frightened her into submission. She implored the
emperor to avert the wrath of God by recalling Chrysostom.
Messengers were despatched with abject apologies to bring him back.
A whole fleet of barks put forth to greet him, the Bosphorus blazed
with torches and resounded with songs of rejoicing. On passing the
gates he was borne aloft by the people to the church, seated in the
episcopal chair and forced to make an address. His triumph was
complete, <pb n="14" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_14.html" id="iii.viii-Page_14" />but of short
duration. Theophilus felt unsafe in Constantinople and abruptly
sailed in the night for Alexandria. The feelings with which
Chrysostom went into his first and second exile, he well describes
in a letter to Bishop Cyriacus: “when I was driven from the city,
I felt no anxiety, but said to myself: If the empress wishes to
banish me, let her do so; ‘the earth is the Lord’s.’ If she
wants to have me sawn asunder, I have Isaiah for an example. If she
wants me to be drowned in the ocean, I think of Jonah. If I am to
be thrown into the fire, the three men in the furnace suffered the
same. If cast before wild beasts, I remember Daniel in the lion’s
den. If she wants me to be stoned, I have before me Stephen, the
first martyr. If she demands my head, let her do so; John the
Baptist shines before me. Naked I came from my mother’s womb,
naked shall I leave this world. Paul reminds me, ‘If I still
pleased men, I would not be the servant of Christ.’”</p>

<span class="c12" id="iii.ix-p1.3">a.d</span>. 403.</i></span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.ix-p2">The restored patriarch and the repentant empress
seemed reconciled, and vied with one another in extravagant
laudations for two months, when the feud broke out afresh and ended
in perpetual exile and death.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.ix-p3">Eudoxia was a beautiful, imperious, intriguing and
revengeful woman, who despised her husband and indulged her
passions. Not content with the virtual rule of the Roman empire,
she aspired to semi-divine honors, which used to be paid to the
heathen Cæsars. A column of porphyry with her silver statue for
public adoration was erected in September, 403, on the forum before
the church of St. Sophia, and dedicated amid boisterous and
licentious revelry, which disturbed the sacred services.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.ix-p4">Chrysostom ascended the pulpit on the
commemoration day of the martyrdom of John the Baptist, and
thundered his righteous indignation against all who shared in these
profane amusements, the people, the prefect, and the haughty woman
on the throne. In the heat of his zeal the imprudent words are said
to have escaped his lips: “Again Herodias is raging, again she is
dancing, again she demands the head of John on a platter.”<note place="end" n="18" id="iii.ix-p4.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.ix-p5">

vi. 25</scripRef>), is
unworthy of his pen and rejected as spurious by Tillemont, Savile
and Montfaucon. But it is quite probable that Chrysostom made some
allusion to Eudoxia which might be construed by his enemies in that
way. See <span class="c12" id="iii.ix-p5.4">Neander</span>, II. 177 sq.</p></note> The comparison of Eudoxia with
Herodias, and himself (John) with John the Baptist was even more
directly personal than his former allusion to the relation of
Jezebel and Elijah. Whether he really spoke these or similar words
is at least doubtful, but they were reported to Eudoxia, who as a
woman and an empress could never forgive such an insult. She
demanded from the emperor signal redress. In the conflict of
imperial and episcopal authority the former achieved a physical and
temporary, the latter a moral and enduring victory.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.ix-p6">The enemies of Chrysostom flocked like vultures down
to their prey. Theophilus directed the plot from a safe distance.
Arcadius was persuaded to issue an order for the removal of
Chrysostom. He continued to preach and refused to leave the church
over which God had placed him, but had to yield to armed force. He
was dragged by imperial guards from the cathedral on the vigil of
the resurrection in 404, while the sacrament of baptism was being
administered to hundreds of catechumens. “The waters of
regeneration,” says Palladius, “were stained with blood.” The
female candidates, half dressed, were driven by licentious soldiers
into the dark streets. The eucharistic elements were profaned by
pagan hands. The clergy in their priestly robes were ejected and
chased through the city. The horrors of that night were long
afterwards remembered with a shudder. During the greater part of
the Easter week the city was kept in a state of consternation.
Private dwellings were invaded, and 
<pb n="15" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_15.html" id="iii.ix-Page_15" />suspected Joannites—the partisans of
Chrysostom—thrown into prison, scourged and tortured. Chrysostom,
who was shut up in his episcopal palace, twice narrowly escaped
assassination.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.ix-p7">At last on June 5, 404, the timid and long
hesitating Arcadius signed the edict of banishment. Chrysostom
received it with calm submission, and after a final prayer in the
cathedral with some of his faithful bishops, and a tender farewell
to his beloved Olympias and her attendant deaconesses, he
surrendered himself to the guards and was conveyed at night to the
Asiatic shore. He had scarcely left the city, when the cathedral
was consumed by fire. The charge of incendiarism was raised against
his friends, but neither threats, nor torture and mutilation could
elicit a confession of guilt. He refused to acknowledge Arsacius
and Atticus as his successors; and this was made a crime punishable
with degradation, fine and imprisonment. The clergy who continued
faithful to him were deposed and banished. Pope Innocent of Rome
was appealed to, pronounced the synod which had condemned
Chrysostom irregular, annulled the deposition, and wrote him a
letter of sympathy, and urged upon Arcadius the convocation of a
general council, but without effect.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.x-p2">Chrysostom was conveyed under the scorching heat of
July and August over Galatia and Cappadocia, to the lonely mountain
village Cucusus, on the borders of Cilicia and Armenia, which the
wrath of Eudoxia had selected for his exile. The climate was
inclement and variable, the winter severe, the place was exposed to
Isaurian brigands. He suffered much from fever and headache, and
was more than once brought to the brink of the grave. Nevertheless
the bracing mountain air invigorated his feeble constitution, and
he was hopeful of returning to his diocese. He was kindly treated
by the bishop of Cucusus. He received visits, letters and presents
from faithful friends, and by his correspondence exerted a wider
influence from that solitude than from the episcopal throne.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.x-p3">His 242 extant letters are nearly all from the
three years of his exile, and breathe a noble Christian spirit, in
a clear, brilliant and persuasive style. They exhibit his faithful
care for all the interests of the church and look calmly and
hopefully to the glories of heaven. They are addressed to Eastern
and Western bishops, presbyters, deacons, deaconesses, monks and
missionaries; they describe the fatigues of his journey, give
advice on a variety of subjects, strengthen and comfort his distant
flock, urge the destruction of heathen temples in Phœnicia, the
extirpation of heresy in Cyprus, and encourage the missions in
Persia and Scythia.<note place="end" n="19" id="iii.x-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.x-p4">
See Tom. iii. of the Bened. ed. (in Migne, III. 529 sqq.)</p></note> Two letters
are addressed to the Roman bishop Innocent I., whose sympathy and
assistance he courted. Seventeen letters—the most important of
all—are addressed to Olympias, the deaconess, a widow of noble
birth, personal beauty and high accomplishments, who devoted her
fortune and time to the poor and the sick. She died between 408 and
420. To her he revealed his inner life, upon her virtues he
lavished extravagant praise, which offends modern taste as fulsome
flattery. For her consolation he wrote a special treatise on the
theme that “No one is really injured except by himself.”<note place="end" n="20" id="iii.x-p4.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.x-p5">

<p class="c10" id="iii.x-p6">The cruel empress, stung by disappointment at the
continued power of the banished bishop, forbade all correspondence
and ordered his transfer by two brutal guards, first to Arabissus,
then to Pityus on the Caucasus, the most inhospitable spots in the
empire.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.x-p7">The journey of three months on foot was a slow
martyrdom to the feeble and sickly old man. He did not reach his
destination, but ended his pilgrimage five or six miles from Comana
in Pontus in the chapel of the martyr Basiliscus on the 14th of
September, 407, in his sixtieth year, the tenth of his episcopate.
Clothed in his white baptismal robes, he partook of the <pb n="16" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_16.html" id="iii.x-Page_16" />eucharist and commended his
soul to God. His last words were his accustomed doxology, the motto
of his life: “Glory be to God for all things, Amen.”<note place="end" n="21" id="iii.x-p7.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.x-p8">
Δόξα τῷ θεῷ π€ντων œνεκεν.</p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.x-p9">He was buried by the side of Basiliscus in the
presence of monks and nuns.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.x-p10">He was revered as a saint by the people. Thirty-one
years afterwards, January 27, 438, his body was translated with
great pomp to Constantinople and deposited with the emperors and
patriarchs beneath the altar of the church of the Holy Apostles.
The young Emperor Theodosius II. and his sister Pulcheria met the
procession at Chalcedon, kneeled down before the coffin, and in the
name of their guilty parents implored the forgiveness of heaven for
the grievous injustice done to the greatest and saintliest man that
ever graced the pulpit and episcopal chair of Constantinople. The
Eastern church of that age shrunk from the bold speculations of
Origen, but revered the narrow orthodoxy of Epiphanius and the
ascetic piety of Chrysostom.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.x-p11">The personal appearance of the golden-mouthed
orator was not imposing, but dignified and winning. He was of small
stature (like David, Paul, Athanasius, Melanchthon, John Wesley,
Schleiermacher). He had an emaciated frame, a large, bald head, a
lofty, wrinkled forehead, deep-set, bright, piercing eyes, pallid,
hollow cheeks, and a short, gray beard.<note place="end" n="22" id="iii.x-p11.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.x-p12">

<span class="c18" id="iii.xi-p1.1">Chapter
XI</span><span class="c1" id="iii.xi-p1.2">.—<i>His Character.</i></span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.xi-p2">Chrysostom was one of those rare men who combine
greatness and goodness, genius and piety, and continue to exercise
by their writings and example a happy influence upon the Christian
church. He was a man for his time and for all times. But we must
look at the spirit rather than the form of his piety, which bore
the stamp of his age.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.xi-p3">He took Paul for his model, but had a good deal of
the practical spirit of James, and of the fervor and loveliness of
John. The Scriptures were his daily food, and he again and again
recommended their study to laymen as well as ministers. He was not
an ecclesiastical statesman, like St. Ambrose, not a profound
divine like St. Augustin, but a pure man, a practical Christian,
and a king of preachers. “He carried out in his own life,” says
Hase, “as far as mortal man can do it, the ideal of the
priesthood which he once described in youthful enthusiasm.” He
considered it the duty of every Christian to promote the spiritual
welfare of his fellowmen. “Nothing can be more chilling,” he
says in the 20th Homily on Acts, “than the sight of a Christian
who makes no effort to save others. Neither poverty, nor humble
station, nor bodily infirmity can exempt men and women from the
obligation of this great duty. To hide our light under pretense of
weakness is as great an insult to God as if we were to say that He
could not make His sun to shine.”</p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.xi-p4">It is very much to his praise that in an age of
narrow orthodoxy and doctrinal intolerance he cherished a catholic
and irenical spirit. He by no means disregarded the value of
theological soundness, and was in hearty agreement with the Nicene
creed, which triumphed over the Arians during his ministry in
Antioch; he even refused a church in Constantinople which the Arian
Goths claimed. But he took no share in the persecution of heretics,
and even sheltered the Origenistic monks against the violence of
Theophilus of Alexandria. He hated sin more than error, and placed
charity above orthodoxy.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.xi-p5">Like all the Nicene Fathers, he was an enthusiast
for ascetic and monastic virtue, which shows itself in seclusion
rather than in transformation of the world and the natural
ordinances of God. He retained as priest and bishop his cloister
habits of simplicity, abstemiousness and unworldliness. He presents
the most favorable aspect of that mode of life, which must be
regarded as a wholesome reaction against the hopeless corruption of
pagan society. He <pb n="17" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_17.html" id="iii.xi-Page_17" />thought
with St. Paul that he could best serve the Lord in single life, and
no one can deny that he was unreservedly devoted to the cause of
religion.<note place="end" n="23" id="iii.xi-p5.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.xi-p6">
Luther’s intense aversion to monkery, although he himself
passed through its discipline, must be taken into account in his
unfavorable judgments of Chrysostom, Jerome and other Fathers
except St. Augustin, whom he esteemed very highly. Of Chrysostom he
must have read very little, or he could not have called him a
“rhetorician full of words and empty of matter.” He spoke well,
however, of Theodoret’s commentaries on the Pauline Epistles,
which is an indirect testimony in favor of Chrysostom’s exegesis.
See <span class="c12" id="iii.xi-p6.1">Schaff</span>, <i>Church Hist</i>. vol. VI.
536.</p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.xi-p7">He was not a man of affairs, and knew little of the
world. He had the harmlessness of the dove without the wisdom of
the serpent. He knew human nature better than individual men. In
this respect he resembles Neander, his best biographer. Besides, he
was irritable of temper, suspicious of his enemies, and easily
deceived and misled by such men as Serapion. He showed these
defects in his quarrel with the court and the aristocracy of
Constantinople. With a little more worldly wisdom and less ascetic
severity he might perhaps have conciliated and converted those whom
he repelled by his pulpit fulminations. Fearless denunciation of
immorality and vice in high places always commands admiration and
respect, especially in a bishop and court preacher who is exposed
to the temptations of flattery. But it is unwise to introduce
personalities into the pulpit and does more harm than good. His
relation to Eudoxia reminds one of the attitude of John Knox to
Mary Stuart. The contrast between the pure and holy zeal of the
preacher and the reformer and the ambition and vanity of a woman on
the throne is very striking and must be judged by higher rules than
those of gallantry and courtesy. But after all, the conduct of
Christ, the purest of the pure, towards Mary Magdalene and the
woman taken in adultery is far more sublime.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.xi-p8">The conflict of Chrysostom with Eudoxia imparts to
his latter life the interest of a romance, and was over-ruled for
his benefit. In his exile his character shines brighter than even
in the pulpit of Antioch and Constantinople. His character was
perfected by suffering. The gentleness, meekness, patience,
endurance and devotion to his friends and his work which he showed
during the last three years of his life are the crowning glory of
his career. Though he did not die a violent death, he deserves to
be numbered among the true martyrs, who are ready for any sacrifice
to the cause of virtue and piety.</p>

of Chrysostom.</i></span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.xii-p2">Chrysostom was the most fruitful author among the
Greek Fathers. Suidas makes the extravagant remark that only the
omniscient God could recount all his writings. The best have been
preserved and have already been noticed in chronological order.
They may be divided into five classes: (1) Moral and ascetic
treatises, including the work on the Priesthood; (2) About six
hundred Homilies and Commentaries; (3) Occasional, festal and
panegyrical orations; (4) Letters; (5) Liturgy.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.xii-p3">His most important and permanently useful works are
his Homilies and Commentaries, which fill eleven of the thirteen
folio volumes of the Benedictine edition. They go together; his
homilies are expository, and his commentaries are homiletical and
practical. Continuous expositions, according to chapter and verse,
he wrote only on the first eight chapters of Isaiah, and on the
Epistle to the Galatians. All others are arranged in sermons with a
moral application at the close. Suidas and Cassiodorus state that
he wrote commentaries on the whole Bible. We have from him Homilies
on Genesis, the Psalms, the Gospel of Matthew, the Gospel of John,
the Acts, the Pauline Epistles including the Hebrews, which he
considered Pauline. Besides, he delivered discourses on separate
texts of Scripture, on church festivals, eulogies on apostles and
martyrs, sermons against the Pagans, against the Jews and Judaizing
Christians, against the Arians, and the famous twenty-one orations
on the Statues.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.xii-p4">He published some of his sermons himself, but most

<span class="c18" id="iii.xiii-p1.1">Chapter XIII</span><span class="c1" id="iii.xiii-p1.2">.—<i>His Theology
and Exegesis.</i></span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.xiii-p2">Chrysostom belonged to the Antiochian school of
theology and exegesis, and is its soundest and most popular
representative. It was founded by his teacher Diodor of Tarsus (d.
393), developed by himself and his fellow-student Theodore of
Mopsuestia (d. 429), and followed by Theodoret and the Syrian and
Nestorian divines. Theodore was the exegete, Chrysostom the
homilist, Theodoret the annotator. The school was afterwards
condemned for its alleged connection with the Nestorian heresy; but
that connection was accidental, not necessary. Chrysostom’s mind
was not given to dogmatizing, and too well balanced to run into
heresy.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.xiii-p3">The Antiochian school agreed with the Alexandrian
school founded by Origen, in maintaining the divine inspiration and
authority of the Scriptures, but differed from it in the method of
interpretation, and in a sharper distinction between the Old and
the New Testaments, and the divine and human elements in the
same.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.xiii-p4">To Origen belongs the great merit of having
opened the path of biblical science and criticism, but he gave the
widest scope to the allegorizing and mystical method by which the
Bible may be made to say anything that is pious and edifying.<note place="end" n="26" id="iii.xiii-p4.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.xiii-p5">
Allegorical interpretation makes the writer say something else than
what he meant, ˆλλο
μšν ‡γορεύει, ˆλλο δš νοει.</p></note> Philo of Alexandria had used that
method for introducing the Platonic philosophy into the Mosaic
writings. Origen was likewise a Platonist, but his chief object was
to remove all that was offensive in the literal sense. The
allegorical method is imposition rather than exposition. Christ
sanctions parabolic teaching and typical, but not allegorical,
interpretation. Paul uses it once or twice, but only incidentally,
when arguing from the rabbinical standpoint.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.xiii-p6">The Antiochian school seeks to explain the obvious
grammatical and historical sense, which is rich enough for all
purposes of instruction and edification. It takes out of the Word
what is actually in it, instead of putting into it all sorts of
foreign notions and fancies.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.xiii-p7">Chrysostom recognizes allegorizing in theory, but
seldom uses it in practice, and then more by way of rhetorical
ornament and in deference to custom. He was generally guided by
sound common sense and practical wisdom. He was more free from
arbitrary and absurd interpretations than almost any other
patristic commentator. He pays proper attention to the connection,
and puts himself into the psychological state and historical
situation of the writer. In one word, he comes very near to what we
now call the grammatico-historical exegesis. This is the only solid
and sound foundation for any legitimate use of the Scriptures. The
sacred writers had one definite object in view; they wished to
convey one particular sense by the ordinary use of language, and to
be clearly understood by their readers. At the 
<pb n="19" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_19.html" id="iii.xiii-Page_19" />same time the truths of revelation are so
deep and so rich that they can be indefinitely expanded and applied
to all circumstances and conditions. Interpretation is one thing,
application is another thing. Chrysostom knew as well as any
allegorist how to derive spiritual nourishment from the Scriptures
and to make them “profitable for teaching, for reproof, for
correction, for instruction in righteousness; that the man of God
may be complete, thoroughly furnished unto every good work.”<note place="end" n="27" id="iii.xiii-p7.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.xiii-p8">

<p class="c10" id="iii.xiii-p11">The commentaries of Chrysostom are of unequal
merit. We must always remember that he is a homiletical commentator
who aimed at the conversion and edification of his hearers. He
makes frequent digressions and neglects to explain the difficulties
of important texts. Grammatical remarks are rare, but noteworthy on
account of his familiarity with the Greek as his mother tongue,
though by no means coming up to the accuracy of a modern expert in
philology. In the Old Testament he depended altogether on the
Septuagint, being ignorant of Hebrew, and often missed the mark.
The Homilies on the Pauline Epistles are considered his best,
especially those to the Corinthians, where he had to deal with
moral and pastoral questions. The doctrinal topics of Romans and
Galatians were less to his taste, and it cannot be said that he
entered into the depths of Paul’s doctrines of sin and grace, or
ascended the height of his conception of freedom in Christ. His
Homilies on Romans are argumentative; his continuous notes on
Galatians somewhat hasty and superficial. The eighty Homilies on
Matthew from his Antiochian period are very valuable. Thomas
Aquinas declared he would rather possess them than be the master of
all Paris. The eighty-eight Homilies on John, also preached at
Antioch, but to a select audience early in the morning, are more
doctrinal and controversial, being directed against the Anomœans
(Arians).<note place="end" n="30" id="iii.xiii-p11.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.xiii-p12">
So called because they taught that the Son is <i>unlike</i>
or <i>dissimilar</i> (‡νόμοιος) to the Father and of a <i>
different</i> substance, in opposition to the Nicene doctrine of
<i>equal</i> substance (ὁμοουσία), and the semi-Arian doctrine of
<i>like</i>, or <i>similar</i> substance (ὁμοιουσία).</p></note> We have no
commentaries from him on Mark and Luke, nor on the Catholic
Epistles and the Apocalypse. The fifty-five homilies on the Acts,
delivered at Constantinople between Easter and Whitsuntide, when
that book was read in the public lessons, contain much interesting
information about the manners and customs of the age, but are the
least polished of his productions. Erasmus, who translated them
into Latin, doubted their genuineness. His life in Constantinople
was too much disturbed to leave him quiet leisure for preparation.
The Homilies on the Hebrews, likewise preached in Constantinople,
were published after his death from notes of his friend, the
presbyter Constantine, and the text is in a confused
state.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.xiii-p13">The Homilies of Chrysostom were a rich storehouse
for the Greek commentators, compilers and epitomizers, such as
Theodoret, Oecumenius, Theophylact, and Euthymius Zigabenus, and
they are worth consulting to this day for their exegetical as well
as their practical value.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.xiii-p14">The theology of Chrysostom must be gathered chiefly
from his commentaries. He differs from the metaphysical divines of
the Nicene age by his predominantly practical ten<pb n="20" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_20.html" id="iii.xiii-Page_20" />dency, and in this respect he
approaches the genius of the Western church. He lived between the
great trinitarian and christological controversies and was only
involved incidentally in the subordinate Origenistic controversy,
in which he showed a charitable and liberal spirit. He accepted the
Nicene Creed, but he died before the rise of the Nestorian and
Eutychian heresies. Speculation was not his forte, and as a thinker
he is behind Athanasius, Gregory of Nyssa, and John of Damascus. He
was a rhetorician rather than a logician.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.xiii-p15">Like all the Greek fathers, he laid great stress on
free-will and the cooperation of the human will with divine grace
in the work of conversion. Cassian, the founder of
Semi-Pelagianism, was his pupil and appealed to his authority.
Julian of Eclanum, the ablest opponent of Augustin, quoted
Chrysostom against original sin; Augustin tried from several
passages to prove the reverse, but could only show that Chrysostom
was no Pelagian. We may say that in tendency and spirit he was a
catholic Semi-Pelagian or Synergist before Semi-Pelagianism was
brought into a system.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.xiii-p16">His anthropology forms a wholesome contrast and
supplement to the anthropology of his younger contemporary, the
great bishop of Hippo, the champion of the slavery of the human
will and the sovereignty of divine grace.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.xiii-p17">We look in vain in Chrysostom’s writings for the
Augustinian and Calvinistic doctrines of absolute predestination,
total depravity, hereditary guilt, irresistible grace, perseverance
of saints, or for the Lutheran theory of forensic and solifidian
justification. He teaches that God foreordained all men to holiness
and salvation, and that Christ died for all and is both willing and
able to save all, but not against their will and without their free
consent. The vessels of mercy were prepared by God unto glory, the
vessels of wrath were not intended by God, but fitted by their own
sin, for destruction. The will of man, though injured by the Fall,
has still the power to accept or to reject the offer of salvation.
It must first obey the divine call. “When we have begun,” he
says, in commenting on 
<scripRef passage="John i. 38" id="iii.xiii-p17.1" parsed="|John|1|38|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.1.38">John i. 38</scripRef>, “when we have sent our will
before, then God gives us abundant opportunities of salvation.”
God helps those who help themselves. “When God,” he says,
“sees us eagerly prepare for the contest of virtue, he instantly
supplies us with his assistance, lightens our labors and
strengthens the weakness of our nature.” Faith and good works are
necessary conditions of justification and salvation, though
Christ’s merits alone are the efficient cause. He remarks on
<scripRef passage="John vi. 44" id="iii.xiii-p17.2" parsed="|John|6|44|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.6.44">John vi. 44</scripRef>, that while no man can come to
Christ unless drawn and taught by the Father, there is no excuse
for those who are unwilling to be thus drawn and taught. Yet on the
other hand he fully admits the necessity of divine grace at the
very beginning of every good action. “We can do no good thing at
all,” he says, “except we are aided from above.” And in his
dying hour he gave glory to God “for all things.”</p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.xiii-p18">Thus Augustinians and Semi-Pelagians, Calvinists and
Arminians, widely as they differ in theory about human freedom and
divine sovereignty, meet in the common feeling of personal
responsibility and absolute dependence on God. With one voice they
disclaim all merit of their own and give all glory to Him who is
the giver of every good and perfect gift and works in us “both to
will and to work, for his good pleasure” (<scripRef passage="Phil. ii. 12" id="iii.xiii-p18.1" parsed="|Phil|2|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Phil.2.12">Phil. ii. 12</scripRef>).<note place="end" n="31" id="iii.xiii-p18.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.xiii-p19">
I add the remarks of <span class="c12" id="iii.xiii-p19.1">Stephens</span> on the
difference between Chrysostom and Augustin (p. 430):
“Unquestionable as the intellectual genius of Chrysostom was, yet
it is rather in the purity of his moral character, his
single-minded boldness of purpose, and the glowing piety which
burns through all his writings, that we find the secret of his
influence. If it was rather the mission of Augustin to mould the
minds of men so as to take a firm grasp of certain great doctrines,
it was the mission of Chrysostom to inflame the whole heart with a
fervent love of God. Rightly has he been called the great teacher
of consummate holiness, as Augustin was the great teacher of
efficient grace; rightly has it been remarked that, like Fénélon,
he is to be ranked among those who may be termed disciples of St.
John, men who seem to have been pious without intermission from
their childhood upwards, and of whose piety the leading
characteristics are ease, cheerfulness and elevation; while
Augustin belongs to the disciples of St. Paul, those who have been
converted from error to truth, or from sin to holiness, and whose
characteristics are gravity , earnestness, depth. If Augustin has
done more valuable service in building up the church at large,
Chrysostom is the more lovable to the individual, and speaks out of
a heart overflowing to God and man, unconstrained by the fetters of
a severe and rigid system. Yet it is precisely on this account that
he has not been so generally appreciated as he deserves. His tone
is too catholic for the Romanist, or for the sectarian partisan of
any denomination. ‘It would be easy to produce abundant instances
of his oratorial abilities; I wish it were in my power to record as
many of his evangelical excellencies.’ Such is the verdict of a
narrow-minded historian [Milner], and the comparative estimation in
which he held St. Augustin and St. Chrysostom may be inferred from
the number of pages in his History given to each: St. Augustin is
favored with 187, Chrysostom with 20. But he whose judgment is not
cramped by the shackles of some harsh and stiff theory of gospel
truth will surely allow that Chrysostom not only preached the
gospel, but lived it. To the last moment of his life he exhibited
that calm, cheerful faith, that patient resignation under
affliction, and untiring perseverance for the good of others, which
are preeminently the marks of a Christian saint. The cause for
which he fought and died in a corrupt age was the cause of
Christian holiness.”</p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.xiii-p20"><pb n="21" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_21.html" id="iii.xiii-Page_21" />As to the
doctrines which separate the Greek, Roman and Protestant churches,
Chrysostom faithfully represents the Greek Catholic church prior to
the separation from Rome. In addition to the œcumenical doctrines
of the Nicene Creed, he expresses strong views on baptismal
regeneration, the real presence, and the eucharistic sacrifice, yet
without a clearly defined theory, which was the result of later
controversies; hence it would be unjust to press his devotional and
rhetorical language into the service of transubstantiation, or
consubstantiation, or the Roman view of the mass.<note place="end" n="32" id="iii.xiii-p20.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.xiii-p21">
In his comments on <scripRef passage="Heb. ix. 26" id="iii.xiii-p21.1" parsed="|Heb|9|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Heb.9.26">Heb. ix. 26</scripRef> (Hom. XVII. on Hebrews, in the
Bened. ed. XII. 241 sq.; in the Oxford translation, p. 213), he
expresses himself on the sacrificial aspect of the eucharist in
these words: “Christ is our High Priest, who offered the
sacrifice that cleanses us. That sacrifice we offer now also, which
was then offered, which cannot be exhausted. This is done in
remembrance of what was then done. For, saith He, ‘Do this in
remembrance of Me.’ It is not another sacrifice that we make
(ποιοῦμεν), as the High Priest of old,
but always the same, or rather we perform a remembrance of a
sacrifice (μ‚λλον δš ‡ν€μνησιν
ἐργαζόμεθα θυσίας).” The word <i>remembrance</i>
would favor the Protestant rather than the Roman view, which
demands an actual, though unbloody, repetition of the sacrifice of
the cross in the mass. Other passages, however, are much stronger,
though highly rhetorical, <i>e.g</i>., <i>De Sacerd</i>. III. 4:
“When you behold the Lord slain, and lying there, and the priest
standing over the sacrifice and praying, and all stained with that
precious blood, do you then suppose you are among men, and standing
upon earth? Are you not immediately transported to Heaven?” In
another place he says, “Christ lies slain (τεθυμ™νος) upon the altar.” And yet the
people were so indifferent that Chrysostom laments: “In vain is
the daily sacrifice, in vain stand we at the altar; there is no one
to take part” (Third Hom. on Ephesians).</p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.xiii-p22">His extravagant laudations of saints and martyrs
promoted that refined form of idolatry which in the Nicene age
began to take the place of the heathen hero-worship. But it is all
the more remarkable that he furnishes no support to Mariolatry,
which soon after his death triumphed in the Greek as well as the
Latin church. He was far from the idea of the sinless perfection
and immaculate conception of the Virgin Mary. He attributes her
conduct at the wedding of Cana (<scripRef passage="John ii. 3, 4" id="iii.xiii-p22.1" parsed="|John|2|3|2|4" osisRef="Bible:John.2.3-John.2.4">John ii. 3, 4</scripRef>) to undue haste, a sort of
unholy ambition for the premature display of the miraculous power
of her Son; and in commenting on

Nestorian controversy, and which was endorsed by the third and
fourth œcumenical councils.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.xiii-p24">As to the question of the papacy he considered the
bishop of Rome as the successor of Peter, the prince of the
Apostles, and appealed to him in his exile against the unjust
condemnation of the Council at the Oak. Such appeals furnished the
popes with a welcome opportunity to act as judges in the
controversies of the Eastern church, and greatly strengthened their
claims. But his Epistle to Innocent was addressed also to the
bishops of Milan and Aquileia, and falls far short of the language
of submission to an infallible authority. He conceded to the pope
merely a primacy of honor (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.xiii-p24.1">προστασία,

bishop of Antioch (Ignatius and Flavian) likewise a successor of
Peter, who labored there according to the express testimony of
Paul. In commenting on

<p class="c10" id="iii.xiii-p26">In one important point Chrysostom approaches the
evangelical theology of the Reformation, his devotion to the Holy
Scriptures as the only rule of faith. “There is no topic on which
he dwells more frequently and earnestly than on the duty of every
Christian man and woman to study the Bible: and what he bade others

into the holy of holies and brings it into direct communion with

<span class="c18" id="iii.xiv-p1.1">Chapter XIV</span><span class="c1" id="iii.xiv-p1.2">.—<i>Chrysostom as
a Preacher.</i></span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.xiv-p2">The crowning merit of Chrysostom is his
excellency as a preacher. He is generally and justly regarded as
the greatest pulpit orator of the Greek church. Nor has he any
superior or equal among the Latin Fathers. He remains to this day a
model for preachers in large cities. He was trained in the school
of Demosthenes and Libanius, and owed much of his literary culture
to the classics. He praises “the polish of Isocrates, the gravity
of Demosthenes, the dignity of Thucydides, and the sublimity of
Plato.” He assigns to Plato the first rank among the
philosophers, but he places St. Paul far above him, and glories in
the victory of the tent-maker and fishermen over the wisdom of the
Greeks.<note place="end" n="37" id="iii.xiv-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.xiv-p3">
<i>De Sacerd</i>., IV. 6.</p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.xiv-p4">He was not free from the defects of the degenerate
rhetoric of his age, especially a flowery exuberance of style and
fulsome extravagance in eulogy of dead martyrs and living men. But
the defects are overborne by the virtues: the fulness of Scripture
knowledge, the intense earnestness, the fruitfulness of
illustration and application, the variation of topics, the command
of language, the elegance and rhythmic flow of his Greek style, the
dramatic vivacity, the quickness and ingenuity of his turns, and
the magnetism of sympathy with his hearers. He knew how to draw in
the easiest manner spiritual nourishment and lessons of practical
wisdom from the Word of God, and to make it a divine voice of
warning and comfort to every hearer. He was a faithful preacher of
truth and righteousness and fearlessly told the whole duty of man.
If he was too severe at times, he erred on virtue’s side. He
preached morals rather than dogmas, Christianity rather than
theology, active, practical Christianity that proves itself in holy
living and dying. He was a martyr of the pulpit, for it was chiefly
his faithful preaching that caused his exile. The effect of his
oratory was enhanced by the magnetism of his personality, and is
weakened to the reader of a translation or even the Greek original.
The living voice and glowing manner are far more powerful than the
written and printed letter.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.xiv-p5">Chrysostom attracted large audiences, and among them
many who would rather have gone to the theatre than hear any
ordinary preacher. He held them spell-bound to the close. Sometimes
they manifested their admiration by noisy applause, and when he
rebuked them for it, they would applaud his rebuke. “You
praise,” he would tell them, “what I have said, and receive my
exhortation with tumults of applause; but show your approbation by
obedience; that is the only praise I seek.”</p>

<p class="c10" id="iii.xiv-p6">The great mediæval poet assigns to Chrysostom
a place in Paradise between Nathan the prophet and Anselm the
theologian, probably because, like Nathan, he rebuked the sins of
the court, and, like Anselm, he suffered exile for his
conviction.<note place="end" n="38" id="iii.xiv-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.xiv-p7">

Jeremy Taylor. Gibbon (who confesses, however, to have read very
few of his Homilies) attributes to him “the happy art of engaging
the passions in the service of virtue, and of exposing the folly as
well as the turpitude of vice, almost with the truth and spirit of
a dramatic representation.” Dean Milman describes him as an
“unrivalled master in that rapid and forcible application of
incidental occurrences which gives such life and reality to
eloquence. He is at times, in the highest sense, dramatic in
manner.” Stephens thus characterizes his sermons:<note place="end" n="41" id="iii.xiv-p12.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.xiv-p13">
<i>St. Chrysostom</i>, p. 426 sq.</p></note></p>

<p class="c28" id="iii.xiv-p14">“A power of exposition which unfolded in lucid
order, passage by passage, the meaning of the book in hand; a rapid
transition from clear exposition, or keen logical argument, to
fervid exhortation, or pathetic appeal, or indignant denunciation;
the versatile ease with which he could lay hold of any little
incident of the moment, such as the lighting of the lamps in the
church, and use it to illustrate his discourse; the mixture of
plain common sense, simple boldness, and tender affection, with
which he would strike home to the hearts and consciences of his
hearers—all these are not only general characteristics of the
man, but are usually to be found manifested more or less in the
compass of each discourse. It is this rare union of powers which
constitutes his superiority to almost all other Christian preachers
with whom he might be, or has been, compared. Savonarola had all,
and more than all, his fire and vehemence, but untempered by his
sober, calm good sense, and wanting his rational method of
interpretation. Chrysostom was eager and impetuous at times in
speech as well as in action, but never fanatical. Jeremy Taylor
combines, like Chrysostom, real earnestness of purpose with
rhetorical forms of expression and florid imagery; but, on the
whole, his style is far more artificial, and is overlaid with a
multifarious learning, from which Chrysostom’s was entirely free.
Wesley is almost his match in simple, straightforward, practical
exhortation, but does not rise into flights of eloquence like his.
The great French preachers, again, resemble him in his more ornate
and declamatory vein, but they lack that simpler common-sense style
of address which equally distinguished him.”</p>

PRIESTHOOD.</span></p>

<p class="c9" id="iv.ii-p2">The events recorded in this celebrated treatise on
the Priesthood must have occurred when St. John Chrysostom was
about twenty-eight years of age. His father had died when he was a
young child; his mother was a devout Christian, but had not
destined him for the clerical vocation. The great ability which he
showed in early youth seemed to mark him out for distinction in one
of the learned professions, and at the age of eighteen he began to
attend the school of Libanius, the most celebrated sophist of the
day, who had won a great reputation as a professor of philosophy
and rhetoric, and as an eloquent opponent of Christianity, not only
in his native city, Antioch, but also in Athens, Nicomedia, and
Constantinople. The artificial character however of his writings
indicates the decadence of literary power; he could skillfully
imitate the style of ancient writers but he could not inform
himself with their spirit; “his productions” says Gibbon [ch.
xxiv], “are for the most part the vain and idle composition of an
orator who cultivated the science of words.”</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.ii-p3">In the school of Libanius Chrysostom no doubt
studied the best classical Greek authors, and although he retained
little admiration for them in later life and probably read them but
rarely, his tenacious memory enabled him to the last to adorn his
homilies with quotations from Homer, Plato and the Tragedians. In
the school of Libanius also he began to practice his nascent power
of eloquence, and a speech which he made in honor of the Emperors
is highly commended in an extant letter of his master. Thus the
Pagan sophist helped to forge the weapons which were destined to be
turned against his own cause. When he was on his death-bed being
asked by his friends who was most worthy to succeed him, “it
would have been John,” he replied, “if the Christians had not
stolen him from us.”</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.ii-p4">In due time Chrysostom began to practise as a
lawyer; and as the profession of the law was reckoned one of the
surest avenues to political distinction for a man of talent, and
the speeches of Chrysostom excited great admiration, a brilliant
and prosperous career seemed to lie before him. But the soul of the
young advocate had drunk draughts from a purer well-spring than the
school of Libanius could supply, and like many other Christians in
that age when society, even Christian society, was deeply tainted
by Pagan sentiments and habits of life, especially in a profligate
city like Antioch, he recoiled from the contrast between the
morality of the world in which he lived, and the standard of
holiness which was presented in the Gospel. The chicanery and
rapacity also prevalent in the profession which he had adopted
became especially repugnant to his conscience. And these feelings
were strengthened by the influence of his intimate friend Basil who
had been a fellow pupil with him at the school of Libanius.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.ii-p5">The first book of the treatise on the Priesthood
opens with a description of his friendship with Basil; how they
studied the same subjects together under the same teachers, and how
entirely harmonious they were in all their tastes, and inclinations
[ci and ii.] Nevertheless when Basil decided to follow what
Chrysostom calls the “true philosophy,” by which he means a
life of religious seclusion and study, Chrysostom could not
immediately make up his mind to follow his example. The balance he
says was no longer even between them; the 
<pb n="28" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_28.html" id="iv.ii-Page_28" />scale of Basil mounted heavenward, while his own
was depressed by the weight of earthly interests, and youthful
ambitions. For a time he continued to practise in the law courts
and to frequent the theatre, and other places of amusement. But
gradually the study of Scripture, and saintly Bishop of Antioch so
wrought upon his mind that he resolved to abandon his secular
calling. And in the first place after the usual course of probation
he was baptized. It may seem surprising that he had not been
baptized in childhood; but a corrupt practice of delaying baptism
(which Chrysostom himself often reprobates in his Homilies) was
prevalent at that time. It was due in some persons to a notion that
sin before Baptism was comparatively venial, in others to a dread
of binding themselves or their children to the purity of life which
was demanded by the Baptismal vows. In the case of Chrysostom it is
possible, I think, that the distracted condition of the church in
Antioch may have operated as a reason, perhaps the chief reason for
the delay. At the date of his birth (about A.D. 345) and for
sixteen years afterwards the See was occupied by Arian Bishops of
the most worldly time-serving type. The good Catholic Bishop
Meletius was appointed in 361 and it was probably some seven or
eight years later that Chrysostom was baptized by him, and ordained
to the office of Reader in the Church.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.ii-p6">There can be no doubt that Baptism, from whatever
cause delayed, must have come home to the recipient at last with
all the more solemnity of meaning. It was often a decisive turning
point in the life, the beginning of a definite renunciation of the
world, and dedication of the whole man to God. To Chrysostom it
evidently was this. For a time he became an enthusiastic ascetic;
and then settled down into that more tranquil, but intense glow of
piety which burned with unabated force to the close of his life.
His baptism and the relinquishment of his secular calling are
probably alluded to in the following treatise c. 3. where he speaks
of “emerging a little from the flood of worldliness” in which
he had been involved. His friend Basil who received him with open
arms does not seem to have joined any monastic community, but
merely to have been living in retirement and practising some of the
usual monastic austerities. The two friends now formed a plan for
withdrawing together to some quiet retreat, there to support one
another in habits of study, meditation, and prayer. c. 4. The
execution of the project was delayed for a time by the passionate
entreaties of Chrysostom’s mother that he would not deprive her
of his companionship and protection. c. 5. He must have been a poor
companion however, for we learn (vi. c. 12) that he rarely went
outside the house, maintained an almost perpetual silence, and was
constantly absorbed in study and prayer. He and Basil in fact
formed with a few other friends a voluntary association of youthful
ascetics who lived under a strict rule. We might compare it with
the association or club formed by John Wesley and his brother at
Oxford which first earned for them the nickname of
“Methodists.” Chrysostom and his friends placed the general
regulation of their studies and religious life under Diodorus and
Carterius, the presidents of the two principal monastic communities
in the neighborhood of Antioch. Diodorus was a man of learning and
ability, opposed to those mystical and allegorical interpretations
of Holy Scripture which often disguised rather than elucidated the
real meaning of the sacred text, so that to his training probably
we are largely indebted for that clear, sensible practical method
of exposition in which Chrysostom so remarkably excels nearly all
the ancient father of the Church.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.ii-p7">Not long after the two friends had adopted this
course of life, probably about the year 374, they were agitated by
a report that they were likely to be advanced to the Episcopate (c.
6.) By a custom which was then common in the Church they were
liable if elected by the clergy and people to be forcibly seized
and ordained however unwilling they might be to accept the dignity
[see notes to chapters 6 and 7]. Basil entreated his friend that in
this crisis of their lives they might act as in former times in
concert, and together accept, or 
<pb n="29" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_29.html" id="iv.ii-Page_29" />evade
if possible the expected but unwelcome
honor. Chrysostom affected assent to this proposal, but secretly
resolved to entrap Basil into the sacred office for which he
considered him to be as eminently fitted as he deemed himself to
be unworthy. The Church should not on account of his own feebleness
be deprived if he could help it, of the able ministrations of such
a man as Basil. Accordingly when some agents of the electing body
[as to the composition of this body, see note 3, p. 21] were sent
to seize the two young men, Chrysostom contrived to hide himself.
His language c. 6. seems to imply that he had some intimation of
their coming which he purposely withheld from Basil who
consequently was caught. He made at first a violent resistance, but
the officials led him to suppose that Chrysostom had already
submitted, and under this delusion he acquiesced. When he
discovered the trick which had been played upon him he naturally
reproached Chrysostom bitterly for his unkind treachery. But the
conscience of Chrysostom seems to have been quite at ease
throughout the transaction. He regarded it as a pious fraud and
when he saw the mingled distress and anger of his friend he could
not refrain, he says, from laughing aloud for joy, and thanking God
for the success of his stratagem. The remainder of the 1st Book
[chs. 8, 9] is occupied by Chrysostom’s vindication of his
conduct, the principle that deceit for a righteous end is often
salutary and justifiable being maintained with an ingenuity and
skill which bespeaks a man who had recently practised in the
law-courts. His arguments indeed savor somewhat unpleasantly of
casuistry, and it must be confessed that in his conduct on this
occasion there is a tinge of something like oriental duplicity
which is repugnant to our moral sense. On the other hand it must be
borne in mind that neither in the East nor in the West, for many
ages were “pious frauds” absolutely condemned by the conscience
of Christendom; there was always an inclination to judge each case
on its own merits, and to condone if not to approve those in which
the balance of evidence was in favor of a righteous or holy
purpose, and a beneficial result. And it must also be owned, in
justice to Chrysostom, that one of the qualities most conspicuous
in him throughout the whole of his subsequent career is fearless,
straightforward honesty alike in act and in speech; and this under
the pressure very often of strong temptation to dissemble and
temporize.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.ii-p8">The remaining books on the Priesthood treat of the
pre-eminent dignity, and sanctity of the priestly office and the
peculiar difficulties and perils which beset it. They abound with
wise and weighty observations instructive for all times, but they
are also interesting from the light which they throw upon the
condition of the Church and of society in the age when Chrysostom
lived. It is to be noted that he is speaking of the priesthood
generally and that it is not always easy to say in any given
passage which of the first two orders in the ministry he has in his
mind. In many instances perhaps he was not thinking of one more
than the other. Where, as was very commonly the case, the
jurisdiction of a bishop did not extend very far beyond the limits
of the city in which his See was placed, his functions would more
nearly resemble those which in our day are discharged by the
incumbent of a large town parish than those which are performed by
the modern Bishop of a large diocese. He was the chief pastor of
the people, as well as the overseer of the clergy. Chrysostom’s
friend Basil has been confused by some with the great Basil, Bishop
of Cæsarea in Cappadocia, who was fifteen years older than
Chrysostom, by others with Basil Bishop of Seleucia, who was many
years younger. Nothing in fact is known about him beyond what is
recorded in this treatise, but he has been conjecturally identified
with Basil Bishop of Raphnea in Syria, not far from Antioch, who
attended the Council of Constantinople in 381.</p>

<p class="c32" id="iv.iii-p3"><span class="c17" id="iv.iii-p3.1">Book I.</span></p>

<p class="c9" id="iv.iii-p4">1. <span class="c12" id="iv.iii-p4.1">I had</span> many genuine
and true friends, men who understood the laws of friendship, and
faithfully observed them; but out of this large number there was
one who excelled all the rest in his attachment to me, striving to
outstrip them as much as they themselves outstripped ordinary
acquaintance. He was one of those who were constantly at my side;
for we were engaged in the same studies, and employed the same
teachers.<note place="end" n="42" id="iv.iii-p4.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii-p5">
Androgathius in philosophy, Libanius in rhetoric.</p></note> We had the
same eagerness and zeal about the studies at which we worked, and a
passionate desire produced by the same circumstances was equally
strong in both of us. For not only when we were attending school,
but after we had left it, when it became necessary to consider what
course of life it would be best for us to adopt, we found ourselves
to be of the same mind.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iii-p6">2. And in addition to these, there were other things
also which preserved and maintained this concord unbroken and
secure. For as regarded the greatness of our fatherland neither had
one cause to vaunt himself over the other, nor was I burdened with
riches, and he pinched by poverty, but our means corresponded as
closely as our tastes. Our families also were of equal rank, and
thus everything concurred with our disposition.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iii-p7">3. But when it became our duty to pursue the
blessed life of monks, and the true philosophy,<note place="end" n="43" id="iv.iii-p7.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii-p8">
An expression frequently employed by St. Chrysostom in the sense of
a life of religious contemplation and study.</p></note> our balance was no longer even, but
his scale mounted high, while I, still entangled in the lusts of
this world, dragged mine down and kept it low, weighting it with
those fancies in which youths are apt to indulge. For the future
our friendship indeed remained as firm as it was before, but our
intercourse was interrupted; for it was impossible for persons who
were not interested about the same things to spend much time
together. But as soon as I also began to emerge a little from the
flood of worldliness, he received me with open arms; yet not even
thus could we maintain our former equality: for having got the
start of me in time, and having displayed great earnestness, he
rose again above my level, and soared to a great height.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iii-p9">4. Being a good man, however, and placing a high
value on my friendship, he separated himself from all the rest (of
the brethren), and spent the whole of his time with me, which he
had desired to do before, but had been prevented as I was saying by
my frivolity. For it was impossible for a man who attended the
law-courts, and was in a flutter of excitement 
<pb n="34" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_34.html" id="iv.iii-Page_34" />about the pleasures of the stage, to be often in
the company of one who was nailed to his books, and never set foot
in the market place. Consequently when the hindrances were removed,
and he had brought me into the same condition of life as himself,
he gave free vent to the desire with which he had long been
laboring. He could not bear leaving me even for a moment, and he
persistently urged that we should each of us abandon our own home
and share a common dwelling:—in fact he persuaded me, and the
affair was taken in hand.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iii-p10">5. But the continual lamentations of my mother
hindered me from granting him the favor, or rather from receiving
this boon at his hands. For when she perceived that I was
meditating this step, she took me into her own private chamber,
and, sitting near me on the bed where she had given birth to me,
she shed torrents of tears, to which she added words yet more
pitiable than her weeping, in the following lamentable strain: My
child, it was not the will of Heaven that I should long enjoy the
benefit of thy father’s virtue. For his death soon followed the
pangs which I endured at thy birth, leaving thee an orphan and me a
widow before my time to face all the horrors of widowhood, which
only those who have experienced them can fairly understand. For no
words are adequate to describe the tempest-tossed condition of a
young woman who, having but lately left her paternal home, and
being inexperienced in business, is suddenly racked by an
overwhelming sorrow, and compelled to support a load of care too
great for her age and sex. For she has to correct the laziness of
servants, and to be on the watch for their rogueries, to repel the
designs of relations, to bear bravely the threats of those who
collect the public taxes,<note place="end" n="44" id="iv.iii-p10.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii-p11">
For an account of the oppressive way in which the public taxes were
collected, see Gibbon’s History (Milman’s edition), vol. iii.
78.</p></note>
and harshness in the imposition of rates. And if the departed one
should have left a child, even if it be a girl, great anxiety will
be caused to the mother, although free from much expense and fear:
but a boy fills her with ten thousand alarms and many anxieties
every day, to say nothing of the great expense which one is
compelled to incur if she wishes to bring him up in a liberal way.
None of these things, however, induced me to enter into a second
marriage, or introduce a second husband into thy father’s house:
but I held on as I was, in the midst of the storm and uproar, and
did not shun the iron furnace<note place="end" n="45" id="iv.iii-p11.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii-p12">
The iron furnace was a Hebrew proverbial expression signifying a
“furnace hot enough to melt iron,” and so a condition of
peculiar trial. See <scripRef passage="Deut. 4.20; Jer. 11.4" id="iv.iii-p12.1" parsed="|Deut|4|20|0|0;|Jer|11|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Deut.4.20 Bible:Jer.11.4">Deut. iv. 20, and Jer. xi. 4</scripRef>.</p></note>
of widowhood. My foremost help indeed was the grace from above; but
it was no small consolation to me under those terrible trials to
look continually on thy face and to preserve in thee a living image
of him who had gone, an image indeed which was a fairly exact
likeness.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iii-p13">On this account, even when thou wast an
infant, and hadst not yet learned to speak, a time when children
are the greatest delight to their parents, thou didst afford me
much comfort. Nor indeed can you complain that, although I bore my
widowhood bravely, I diminished thy patrimony, which I know has
been the fate of many who have had the misfortune to be orphans.
For, besides keeping the whole of it intact, I spared no expense
which was needful to give you an honorable position, spending for
this purpose some of my own fortune, and of my marriage dowry. Yet
do not think that I say these things by way of reproaching you;
only in return for all these benefits I beg one favor: do not
plunge me into a second widowhood; nor revive the grief which is
now laid to rest: wait for my death: it may be in a little while I
shall depart. The young indeed look forward to a distant old age;
but we who have grown old<note place="end" n="46" id="iv.iii-p13.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii-p14">
This must be regarded as a kind of rhetorical expression, as we
learn from Chrysostom’s “Letter to a young widow” (see page
122) that his mother was not much past 40 at this time.</p></note>
have nothing but death to wait for. When, then, you shall have
committed my body to the ground, and mingled my bones with thy
father’s, embark for a long voyage, and set sail on any sea thou
wilt: then there will be no one to hinder thee: but as long as my
life lasts, be content to live with me. Do not, I pray you, oppose
God in vain, involving me without cause, who have done you no
wrong, in these great calamities. For if you have any reason to
complain that I drag you into worldly cares, and force you to
attend to business, do not be restrained by any reverence for the
laws of nature, for training or custom, but fly from me as an
enemy; but if, on the contrary, I do everything to provide leisure
for thy journey through this life, let this bond at least if
nothing else keep thee by me. For couldst thou say that ten
thousand loved thee, yet no one will afford thee the enjoyment of
so much liberty, seeing there is no one who is equally anxious for
thy welfare.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iii-p15">6. These words, and more, my mother spake to me, and
I related them to that noble youth. But he, so far from being
disheartened by these speeches, was the more urgent in making the
same request as before. Now while we were thus situated, he
continually entreating, and I refusing my assent, we were both of
us disturbed by a report suddenly reaching us that we were about to
be advanced to the dignity of 
<pb n="35" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_35.html" id="iv.iii-Page_35" />the episcopate.<note place="end" n="47" id="iv.iii-p15.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii-p16">

“the priesthood,” which Bengel adopts, thinking that neither
Basil nor Chrysostom could have been elected for the higher order
at so early an age, but see below, p. 4, note 1.</p></note> As soon as I heard this rumor I was
seized with alarm and perplexity: with alarm lest I should be made
captive against my will, and perplexity, inquiring as I often did
whence any such idea concerning us could have entered the minds of
these men; for looking to myself I found nothing worthy of such an
honor. But that noble youth having come to me privately, and having
conferred with me about these things as if with one who was
ignorant of the rumor, begged that we might in this instance also
as formerly shape our action and our counsels the same way: for he
would readily follow me whichever course I might pursue, whether I
attempted flight or submitted to be captured. Perceiving then his
eagerness, and considering that I should inflict a loss upon the
whole body of the Church if, owing to my own weakness, I were to
deprive the flock of Christ of a young man who was so good and so
well qualified for the supervision of large numbers, I abstained
from disclosing to him the purpose which I had formed, although I
had never before allowed any of my plans to be concealed from him.
I now told him that it would be best to postpone our decision
concerning this matter to another season, as it was not immediately
pressing, and by so doing persuaded him to dismiss it from his
thoughts, and at the same time encouraged him to hope that, if such
a thing should ever happen to us, I should be of the same mind with
him. But after a short time, when one who was to ordain us arrived,
I kept myself concealed, but Basil, ignorant of this, was taken

promises which I had made to him that I should certainly follow, or
rather supposing that he was following me. For some of those who
were present, seeing that he resented being seized, deceived him by
exclaiming how strange it was that one who was generally reputed to
be the more hot tempered (meaning me), had yielded very mildly to
the judgment of the Fathers, whereas he, who was reckoned a much
wiser and milder kind of man, had shown himself hotheaded and
conceited, being unruly, restive, and contradictory.<note place="end" n="48" id="iv.iii-p16.4"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii-p17">
Forcible ordinations were not uncommon in the Church at this time.
St. Augustin was dragged weeping by the people before the Bishop,
and his ordination demanded. St. Martin of Tours was torn from his
cell, and conveyed to ordination under a guard. Possid. Vita Aug.
4; Sulp. Severus, Vit. St. Martin, i. 224. The affectation of
reluctance to be consecrated became a fashion in the Coptic Church.
The patriarch elect of Alexandria is still brought to Cairo loaded

remonstrances, and afterwards having learned that I had escaped
capture, he came to me in deep dejection, sat down near me and
tried to speak, but was hindered by distress of mind and inability
to express in words the violence to which he had been subjected. No
sooner had he opened his mouth than he was prevented from utterance
by grief cutting short his words before they could pass his lips.
Seeing, then, his tearful and agitated condition, and knowing as I
did the cause, I laughed for joy, and, seizing his right hand, I
forced a kiss on him, and praised God that my plan had ended so
successfully, as I had always prayed it might. But when he saw that
I was delighted and beaming with joy, and understood that he had
been deceived by me, he was yet more vexed and
distressed.</p>

agitation of mind, he began: If you have rejected the part allotted
to you, and have no further regard for me (I know not indeed for
what cause), you ought at least to consider your own reputation;
but as it is you have opened the mouths of all, and the world is
saying that you have declined this ministry through love of
vainglory, and there is no one who will deliver you from this
accusation. As for me, I cannot bear to go into the market place;
there are so many who come up to me and reproach me every day. For,
when they see me anywhere in the city, all my intimate friends take
me aside, and cast the greater part of the blame upon me. Knowing
his intention, they say, for none of his affairs could be kept
secret from you, you should not have concealed it, but ought to
have communicated it to us, and we should have been at no loss to
devise some plan for capturing him. But I am too much ashamed and
abashed to tell them that I did not know you had long been plotting
this trick, lest they should say that our friendship was a mere
pretence. For even if it is so, as indeed it is—nor would you
yourself deny it after what you have done to me—yet it is well to
hide our misfortune from the outside world, and persons who
entertain but a moderate opinion of us. I shrink from telling them
the truth, and how things really stand with us, and I am compelled
in future to keep silence, and look down on the ground, and turn
away to avoid those whom I meet. For if I escape the condemnation
on the former charge, I am forced to undergo judgment for speaking
falsehood. For they will never believe me when I say that you
ranged Basil amongst those who are not permitted to know your
secret affairs. Of this, however, I will not take much account,
since it has seemed agreeable to you, but how shall we endure the
future disgrace? for some accuse you of arrogance, others of
vainglory: while those 
<pb n="36" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_36.html" id="iv.iii-Page_36" />who are our more merciful accusers, lay
both these offences to our charge, and add that we have insulted
those who did us honor, although had they experienced even greater
indignity it would only have served them right for passing over so
many and such distinguished men and advancing mere youths,<note place="end" n="49" id="iv.iii-p18.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii-p19">
Chrysostom was about 28 at this time. The Council of Neo Cæsarea

priesthood, and the same age at least must have been required for a

of 22, A.D. 457; and there are many other instances of bishops,
under the prescribed age.</p></note> who were but yesterday immersed in
the interests of this world, to such a dignity as they never have
dreamed of obtaining, in order that they may for a brief season
knit the eyebrows, wear dusky garments, and put on a grave face.
Those who from the dawn of manhood to extreme old age have
diligently practised self-discipline, are now to be placed under
the government of youths who have not even heard the laws which
should regulate their administration of this office. I am
perpetually assailed by persons who say such things and worse, and
am at a loss how to reply to them; but I pray you tell me: for I do
not suppose that you took to flight and incurred such hatred from
such distinguished men without cause or consideration, but that
your decision was made with reasoning and circumspection: whence
also I conjecture that you have some argument ready for your
defence. Tell me, then, whether there is any fair excuse which I
can make to those who accuse us.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iii-p20">For I do not demand any account for the wrongs
which I have sustained at your hands, nor for the deceit or
treachery you have practised, nor for the advantage which you have
derived from me in the past. For I placed my very life, so to say,
in your hands, yet you have treated me with as much guile as if it
had been your business to guard yourself against an enemy. Yet if
you knew this decision of ours to be profitable, you ought not to
have avoided the gain: if on the contrary injurious, you should
have saved me also from the loss, as you always said that you
esteemed me before every one else. But you have done everything to
make me fall into the snare: and you had no need of guile and
hypocrisy in dealing with one who was wont to display the utmost
sincerity and candor in speech and action towards thee.
Nevertheless, as I said, I do not now accuse you of any of these
things, or reproach you for the lonely position in which you have
placed me by breaking off those conferences from which we often
derived no small pleasure and profit; but all these things I pass
by, and bear in silence and meekness, not that thou hast acted
meekly in transgressing against me, but because from the day that I
cherished thy friendship I laid it down as a rule for myself, that
whatever sorrow you might cause me I would never force you to the
necessity of an apology. For you know yourself that you have
inflicted no small loss on me if at least you remember what we were
always saying ourselves, and the outside world also said concerning
us, that it was a great gain for us to be of one mind and be
guarded by each other’s friendship. Every one said, indeed, that
our concord would bring no small advantage to many besides
ourselves; I never perceived, however, so far as I am concerned,
how it could be of advantage to others: but I did say that we
should at least derive this benefit from it: that those who wished
to contend with us would find us difficult to master. And I never
ceased reminding you of these things: saying the age is a cruel
one, and designing men are many, genuine love is no more, and the
deadly pest of envy has crept into its place: we walk in the midst
of snares, and on the edge of battlements;<note place="end" n="50" id="iv.iii-p20.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii-p21">

dissolve this genuine intimacy, nor break down the fortress. Such
things and more I was continually saying, not indeed that I ever
suspected anything of this kind, but supposing you to be entirely
sound in your relation towards me, I did it as a superfluous
precaution, wishing to preserve in health one who was already
sound; but unwittingly, as it seems, I was administering medicines
to a sick man: and even so I have not been fortunate enough to do
any good, and have gained nothing by my excess of forethought. For
having totally cast away all these considerations, without giving
them a thought, you have turned me adrift like an unballasted
vessel on an untried ocean, taking no heed of those fierce billows
which I must encounter. For if it should ever be my lot to undergo
calumny, or mockery, or any other kind of insult or menace (and
such things must frequently occur), to whom shall I fly for refuge:
to whom shall I impart my distress, who will be willing to succour
me and drive back my assailants and put a stop to their assaults?
who <pb n="37" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_37.html" id="iv.iii-Page_37" />will solace me and
prepare me to bear the coarse ribaldry which may yet be in store
for me. There is no one since you stand aloof from this terrible
strife, and cannot even hear my cry. Seest thou then what mischief
thou hast wrought? now that thou hast dealt the blow, dost thou
perceive what a deadly wound thou hast inflicted? But let all this
pass: for it is impossible to undo the past, or to find a path
through pathless difficulties. What shall I say to the outside
world? what defence shall I make to their accusations.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iii-p23">8. <span class="c12" id="iv.iii-p23.1">Chrysostom</span>: Be of
good cheer, I replied, for I am not only ready to answer for myself
in these matters, but I will also endeavor as well as I am able to
render an account of those for which you have not held me
answerable. Indeed, if you wish it, I will make them the
starting-point of my defence. For it would be a strange piece of
stupidity on my part if, thinking only of praise from the outside
public, and doing my best to silence their accusations, I were
unable to convince my dearest of all friends that I am not wronging
him, and were to treat him with indifference greater than the zeal
which he has displayed on my behalf, treating me with such
forbearance as even to refrain from accusing me of the wrongs which
he says he has suffered from me, and putting his own interests out
of the question in consideration for mine.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iii-p24">What is the wrong that I have done thee, since
I have determined to embark from this point upon the sea of
apology? Is it that I misled you and concealed my purpose? Yet I
did it for the benefit of thyself who wast deceived, and of those
to whom I surrendered you by means of this deceit. For if the evil
of deception is absolute, and it is never right to make use of it,
I am prepared to pay any penalty you please: or rather, as you will
never endure to inflict punishment upon me, I shall subject myself
to the same condemnation which is pronounced by judges on
evil-doers when their accusers have convicted them. But if the
thing is not always harmful, but becomes good or bad according to
the intention of those who practise it, you must desist from
complaining of deceit, and prove that it has been devised against
you for a bad purpose; and as long as this proof is wanting it
would only be fair for those who wish to conduct themselves
prudently, not only to abstain from reproaches and accusation, but
even to give a friendly reception to the deceiver. For a well-timed
deception, undertaken with an upright intention, has such
advantages, that many persons have often had to undergo punishment
for abstaining from fraud. And if you investigate the history of
generals who have enjoyed the highest reputation from the earliest
ages, you will find that most of their triumphs were achieved by
stratagem, and that such are more highly commended than those who
conquer in open fight. For the latter conduct their campaigns with
greater expenditure of money and men, so that they gain nothing by
the victory, but suffer just as much distress as those who have
been defeated, both in the sacrifice of troops and the exhaustion
of funds. But, besides this, they are not even permitted to enjoy
all the glory which pertains to the victory; for no small part of
it is reaped by those who have fallen, because in spirit they were
victorious, their defeat was only a bodily one: so that had it been
possible for them not to fall when they were wounded, and death had
not come and put the finishing stroke to their labors, there would
have been no end of their prowess. But one who has been able to
gain the victory by stratagem involves the enemy in ridicule as
well as disaster. Again, in the other case both sides equally carry
off the honors bestowed upon valor, whereas in this case they do
not equally obtain those which are bestowed on wisdom, but the
prize falls entirely to the victors, and, another point no less
important is that they preserve the joy of the victory for the
state unalloyed; for abundance of resources and multitudes of men
are not like mental powers: the former indeed if continually used
in war necessarily become exhausted, and fail those who possess
them, whereas it is the nature of wisdom to increase the more it is
exercised. And not in war only, but also in peace the need of
deceit may be found, not merely in reference to the affairs of the
state, but also in private life, in the dealings of husband with
wife and wife with husband, son with father, friend with friend,
and also children with a parent. For the daughter of Saul would not
have been able to rescue her husband out of Saul’s hands<note place="end" n="52" id="iv.iii-p24.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii-p25">

<p class="c10" id="iv.iii-p27"><span class="c12" id="iv.iii-p27.1">Basil</span>: But none of these
cases apply to me: for I am not an enemy, nor one of those who are
striving to injure thee, but quite the contrary. For I entrusted
all my interests to your judgment, and always followed it whenever
you bid me.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iii-p28"><span class="c12" id="iv.iii-p28.1">Chrysostom</span>: But, my
admirable and excellent Sir, this is the very reason why I took the
precaution of saying that it was a good thing to employ this kind
of deceit, not only in war, and in dealing with enemies, but also
<pb n="38" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_38.html" id="iv.iii-Page_38" />in peace, and in dealing
with our dearest friends. For as a proof that it is beneficial not
only to the deceivers, but also to those who are deceived; if you
go to any of the physicians and ask them how they relieve their
patients from disease, they will tell you that they do not depend
upon their professional skill alone, but sometimes conduct the sick
to health by availing themselves of deceit, and blending the
assistance which they derive from it with their art. For when the
waywardness of the patient and the obstinacy of the complaint
baffle the counsels of the physicians, it is then necessary to put
on the mask of deceit in order that, as on the stage, they may be
able to hide what really takes place. But, if you please, I will
relate to you one instance of stratagem out of many which I have
heard of being contrived by the sons of the healing art.<note place="end" n="54" id="iv.iii-p28.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii-p29">
Literally, “sons of physicians.” Compare the expression “sons
of the prophets” in the Old Testament.</p></note> A man was once suddenly attacked by
a fever of great severity; the burning heat increased, and the
patient rejected the remedies which could have reduced it and
craved for a draught of pure wine, passionately entreating all who
approached to give it him and enable him to satiate this deadly
craving—I say deadly, for if any one had gratified this request
he would not only have exasperated the fever, but also have driven
the unhappy man frantic. Thereupon, professional skill being
baffled, and at the end of its resources and utterly thrown away,
stratagem stepped in and displayed its power in the way which I
will now relate. For the physician took an earthen cup brought
straight out of the furnace, and having steeped it in wine, then
drew it out empty, filled it with water, and, having ordered the
chamber where the sick man lay to be darkened with curtains that
the light might not reveal the trick, he gave it him to drink,
pretending that it was filled with undiluted wine. And the man,
before he had taken it in his hands, being deceived by the smell,
did not wait to examine what was given him, but convinced by the
odor, and deceived by the darkness, eagerly gulped down the
draught, and being satiated with it immediately shook off the
feeling of suffocation and escaped the imminent peril.<note place="end" n="55" id="iv.iii-p29.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii-p30">
Clement of Alexandria (Stromata vii.) illustrates the same doctrine
of allowable deceit for a useful purpose by a similar reference to
the practice of physicians.</p></note> Do you see the advantage of deceit?
And if any one were to reckon up all the tricks of physicians the
list would run on to an indefinite length. And not only those who
heal the body but those also who attend to the diseases of the soul
may be found continually making use of this remedy. Thus the
blessed Paul attracted those multitudes of Jews:<note place="end" n="56" id="iv.iii-p30.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii-p31">

up for the defects of the mind. For I would not call Phinees a

same. For that man would fairly deserve to be called a deceiver who
made an unrighteous use of the practice, not one who did so with a
salutary purpose. And often it is necessary to deceive, and to do
the greatest benefits by means of this device, whereas he who has
gone by a straight course has done great mischief to the person

the leader of the apostles He said, “Peter, lovest thou me?”
and when he confessed that he did, the Lord added, “if thou
lovest me tend my sheep.” The Master asked the disciple if He was
loved by him, not in order to get information (how should He who
penetrates the hearts of all men?), but in order to teach us how
great an interest He takes in the superintendence of these sheep.
This being plain, it will likewise be manifest that a great and
unspeakable reward will be reserved for him whose labors are
concerned with these sheep, upon which Christ places such a high
value. For when we see any one bestowing care upon members of our
household, or upon our flocks, we count his zeal for them as a sign
of love towards ourselves: yet all these things are to be bought
for money:—with how great a gift then will He requite those who
tend the flock which He purchased, not with money, nor anything of
that kind, but by His own death, giving his own blood as the price
of the herd. Wherefore when the disciple said, “Thou knowest Lord
that I love Thee,” and invoked the beloved one Himself as a
witness of his love, the Saviour did not stop there, but added that
which was the token of love. For He did not at that time wish to
show how much Peter loved Him, but how much He Himself loved His
own Church, and he desired to teach Peter and all of us that we
also should bestow much zeal upon the same. For why did God not
spare His only-begotten Son, but delivered Him up, although the

the disciple, but from a desire to show the exceeding depth of his
own love: so now also when He says, “Who then is the faithful and
wise servant?” he speaks not as being ignorant who is faithful
and wise, but as desiring to set forth the rarity of such a
character, and the greatness of this office. Observe at any rate
how great the reward is—“He will appoint him,” he says,
“ruler over all his goods.”<note place="end" n="69" id="iv.iv-p7.6"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iv-p8">

<p class="c10" id="iv.iv-p9">2. Will you, then, still contend that you were
not rightly deceived, when you are about to superintend the things
which belong to God, and are doing that which when Peter did the
Lord said he should be able to surpass the rest of the apostles,
for His words were, “Peter, lovest thou me more than these?”<note place="end" n="70" id="iv.iv-p9.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iv-p10">
In some editions the words “tend my sheep” are added here.</p></note> Yet He might have said to him, “If
thou lovest me practise fasting, sleeping on the ground, and
prolonged vigils, defend the wronged, be as a father to orphans,
and supply the place of a husband to their mother.” But as a
matter of fact, setting aside all these things, what does He say?
“Tend my sheep.” For those things which I have already
mentioned might easily be performed by many even of those who are
under authority, women as well as men; but when one is required to
preside over the Church, and to be entrusted with the care of so
many souls, the whole female sex must retire before the magnitude
of the task, and the majority of men also; and we must bring
forward those who to a large extent surpass all others, and soar as
much above them in excellence of spirit as Saul overtopped the
whole Hebrew nation in bodily stature: or rather far more.<note place="end" n="71" id="iv.iv-p10.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iv-p11">

height of shoulders as the standard of inquiry; but let the
distinction between the pastor and his charge be as great as that
between rational man and irrational creatures, not to say even
greater, inasmuch as the risk is concerned with things of far
greater importance. He indeed who has lost sheep, either through
the ravages of wolves, or the attacks of robbers, or through
murrain, or any other disaster befalling them, might perhaps obtain
some indulgence from the owner of the flock; and even if the latter
should demand satisfaction the penalty would be only a matter of
money: but he who has human beings entrusted to him, the rational
flock of Christ, incurs a penalty in the first place for the loss
of the sheep, which goes beyond material things and touches his own
life: and in the second place he has to carry on a far greater and
more difficult contest. For he has not to contend with wolves, nor
to dread robbers, nor to consider how he may avert pestilence from
the flock. With whom then has he to fight? with whom has he to
wrestle? Listen to the words of St. Paul. “We wrestle not against
flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers,
against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual
wickedness in high places.”<note place="end" n="72" id="iv.iv-p11.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iv-p12">

Do you see the terrible multitude of enemies, and their fierce
squadrons, not steel clad, but endued with a nature which is of
itself an equivalent for a complete suit of armor. Would you see
yet another host, stern and cruel, beleaguering this flock? This
also you shall behold from the same post of observation. For he who
has discoursed to us concerning the others, points out these
enemies also to us, speaking in a certain place on this wise:
“The works of the flesh are manifest, which are these,
fornication, adultery, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry,
witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulation, wrath, strife,<note place="end" n="73" id="iv.iv-p12.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iv-p13">

besides; for he did not make a complete list, but left us to
understand the rest from these. Moreover, in the case of the
shepherd of irrational creatures, those who wish to destroy the
flock, when they see the guardian take to flight, cease making war
upon him, and are contented with the seizure of the cattle: but in
this case, even should they capture the whole flock, they do not
leave the shepherd unmolested, but attack him all the more, and wax
bolder, ceasing not until they have either overthrown him, or have
themselves been vanquished. Again, the afflictions of sheep are
manifest, whether it be famine, or pestilence, or wounds, or
whatsoever else it may be which distresses them, and this might
help not a little towards the relief of those who are oppressed in
these ways. And there is yet another fact greater than this which
facilitates release from this kind of infirmity. And what is that?
The shepherds with great authority compel the sheep to receive the
remedy when they do not willingly submit to it. For it is easy to
bind them when cautery or cutting is required, and to keep them
inside the fold for a long time, whenever it is expedient, and to
bring them one kind of food instead of another, and to cut them off
from their supplies of water, and all other things which the
shepherds may decide to be conducive to their health they perform
with great ease.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iv-p15"><pb n="41" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_41.html" id="iv.iv-Page_41" />3. But in
the case of human infirmities, it is not easy in the first place
for a man to discern them, for no man “knoweth the things of a
man, save the spirit of man which is in him.”<note place="end" n="75" id="iv.iv-p15.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iv-p16">
<scripRef passage="1 Cor. ii. 11" id="iv.iv-p16.1" parsed="|1Cor|2|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.2.11">1 Cor. ii. 11</scripRef>.</p></note> How then can any one apply the
remedy for the disease of which he does not know the character,
often indeed being unable to understand it even should he happen to
sicken with it himself? And even when it becomes manifest, it
causes him yet more trouble: for it is not possible to doctor all
men with the same authority with which the shepherd treats his
sheep. For in this case also it is necessary to bind and to
restrain from food, and to use cautery or the knife: but the
reception of the treatment depends on the will of the patient, not
of him who applies the remedy. For this also was perceived by that
wonderful man (St. Paul) when he said to the Corinthians—“Not
for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your
joy.”<note place="end" n="76" id="iv.iv-p16.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iv-p17">
<scripRef passage="2 Cor. i. 24" id="iv.iv-p17.1" parsed="|2Cor|1|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.1.24">2 Cor. i. 24</scripRef>.</p></note> For Christians
above all men are not permitted forcibly to correct the failings of
those who sin. Secular judges indeed, when they have captured
malefactors under the law, show their authority to be great, and
prevent them even against their will from following their own
devices: but in our case the wrong-doer must be made better, not by
force, but by persuasion. For neither has authority of this kind
for the restraint of sinners been given us by law, nor, if it had
been given, should we have any field for the exercise of our power,
inasmuch as God rewards those who abstain from evil by their own
choice, not of necessity. Consequently much skill is required that
our patients may be induced to submit willingly to the treatment
prescribed by the physicians, and not only this, but that they may
be grateful also for the cure. For if any one when he is bound
becomes restive (which it is in his power to be), he makes the
mischief worse; and if he should pay no heed to the words which cut
like steel, he inflicts another wound by means of this contempt,
and the intention to heal only becomes the occasion of a worse
disorder. For it is not possible for any one to cure a man by
compulsion against his will.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iv-p18">4. What then is one to do? For if you deal too
gently with him who needs a severe application of the knife, and do
not strike deep into one who requires such treatment, you remove
one part of the sore but leave the other: and if on the other hand
you make the requisite incision unsparingly, the patient, driven to
desperation by his sufferings, will often fling everything away at
once, both the remedy and the bandage, and throw himself down
headlong, “breaking the yoke and bursting the band.”<note place="end" n="77" id="iv.iv-p18.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iv-p19">
Conf. <scripRef passage="Jer. v. 5" id="iv.iv-p19.1" parsed="|Jer|5|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Jer.5.5">Jer. v. 5</scripRef>.</p></note> I could tell of many who have run
into extreme evils because the due penalty of their sins was
exacted. For we ought not, in applying punishment, merely to
proportion it to the scale of the offence, but rather to keep in
view the disposition of the sinner, lest whilst wishing to mend
what is torn, you make the rent worse, and in your zealous
endeavors to restore what is fallen, you make the ruin greater. For
weak and careless characters, addicted for the most part to the
pleasures of the world, and having occasion to be proud on account
of birth and position, may yet, if gently and gradually brought to
repent of their errors, be delivered, partially at least, if not
perfectly, from the evils by which they are possessed: but if any
one were to inflict the discipline all at once, he would deprive
them of this slight chance of amendment. For when once the soul has
been forced to put off shame it lapses into a callous condition,
and neither yields to kindly words nor bends to threats, nor is
susceptible of gratitude, but becomes far worse than that city
which the prophet reproached, saying, “thou hadst the face of a
harlot, refusing to be ashamed before all men.”<note place="end" n="78" id="iv.iv-p19.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iv-p20">

much discretion, and of a myriad eyes to observe on every side the
habit of the soul. For as many are uplifted to pride, and then sink
into despair of their salvation, from inability to endure severe
remedies, so are there some, who from paying no penalty equivalent
to their sins, fall into negligence, and become far worse, and are
impelled to greater sins. It behoves the priest therefore to leave
none of these things unexamined, but, after a thorough inquiry into
all of them, to apply such remedies as he has appositely to each
case, lest his zeal prove to be in vain. And not in this matter
only, but also in the work of knitting together the severed members
of the Church, one can see that he has much to do. For the pastor
of sheep has his flock following him, wherever he may lead them:
and if any should stray out of the straight path, and, deserting
the good pasture, feed in unproductive or rugged places, a loud
shout suffices to collect them and bring back to the fold those who
have been parted from it: but if a human being wanders away from
the right faith, great exertion, perseverance and patience are
required; for he cannot be dragged back by force, nor constrained
by fear, but must be led back by persuasion to the truth from which
he originally swerved. The pastor therefore ought to be of a noble
spirit, so as not to despond, or to despair of the salvation of
wan<pb n="42" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_42.html" id="iv.iv-Page_42" />derers from the
fold, but continually to reason with himself and say,
“Peradventure God will give them repentance to the acknowledging
of the truth, and that they may recover themselves out of the snare
of the devil.”<note place="end" n="79" id="iv.iv-p20.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iv-p21">

For he indeed who disciplines himself compasses only his own
advantage, but the benefit of the pastoral function extends to the
whole people. And one who dispenses money to the needy, or
otherwise succors the oppressed, benefits his neighbors to some
extent, but so much less than the priest in proportion as the body
is inferior to the soul. Rightly therefore did the Lord say that
zeal for the flock was a token of love for Himself.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iv-p23"><span class="c12" id="iv.iv-p23.1">Basil</span>: But thou
thyself—dost thou not love Christ?</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iv-p24"><span class="c12" id="iv.iv-p24.1">Chrysostom</span>: Yea, I love
Him, and shall never cease loving Him; but I fear lest I should
provoke Him whom I love.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iv-p25"><span class="c12" id="iv.iv-p25.1">Basil</span>: But what riddle can
there be more obscure than this—Christ has commanded him who
loves Him to tend His sheep, and yet you say that you decline to
tend them because you love Him who gave this command?</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iv-p26"><span class="c12" id="iv.iv-p26.1">Chrysostom</span>: My saying is no
riddle, but very intelligible and simple, for if I were well
qualified to administer this office, as Christ desired it, and then
shunned it, my remark might be open to doubt, but since the
infirmity of my spirit renders me useless for this ministry, why
does my saying deserve to be called in question? For I fear lest if
I took the flock in hand when it was in good condition and well
nourished, and then wasted it through my unskilfulness, I should
provoke against myself the God who so loved the flock as to give
Himself up for their salvation and ransom.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iv-p27"><span class="c12" id="iv.iv-p27.1">Basil</span>: You speak in jest:
for if you were in earnest I know not how you would have proved me
to be justly grieved otherwise than by means of these very words
whereby you have endeavored to dispel my dejection. I knew indeed
before that you had deceived and betrayed me, but much more now,
when you have undertaken to clear yourself of my accusations, do I
plainly perceive and understand the extent of the evils into which
you have led me. For if you withdrew yourself from this ministry
because you were conscious that your spirit was not equal to the
burden of the task, I ought to have been rescued from it before
you, even if I had chanced to have a great desire for it, to say
nothing of having confided to you the entire decision of these
matters: but as it is, you have looked solely to your own interest
and neglected mine. Would indeed you had entirely neglected them;
then I should have been well content: but you plotted to facilitate
my capture by those who wished to seize me. For you cannot take
shelter in the argument that public opinion deceived you and
induced you to imagine great and wonderful things concerning me.
For I was none of your wonderful and distinguished men, nor, had
this been the case, ought you to have preferred public opinion to
truth. For if I had never permitted you to enjoy my society, you
might have seemed to have a reasonable pretext for being guided in
your vote by public report; but if there is no one who has such
thorough knowledge of my affairs, if you are acquainted with my
character better than my parents and those who brought me up, what
argument can you employ which will be convincing enough to persuade
your hearers that you did not purposely thrust me into this danger:
say, what answer shall I make to your accusers?</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iv-p28"><span class="c12" id="iv.iv-p28.1">Chrysostom</span>: Nay! I
will not proceed to those questions until I have resolved such as
concern yourself alone, if you were to ask me ten thousand times to
dispose of these charges. You said indeed that ignorance would
bring me forgiveness, and that I should have been free from all
accusation if I had brought you into your present position not
knowing anything about you, but that as I did not betray you in
ignorance, but was intimately acquainted with your affairs, I was
deprived of all reasonable pretext and excuse. But I say precisely
the reverse: for in such matters there is need of careful scrutiny,
and he who is going to present any one as qualified for the
priesthood ought not to be content with public report only, but
should also himself, above all and before all, investigate the
man’s character. For when the blessed Paul says, “He must also
have a good report of them which are without,”<note place="end" n="81" id="iv.iv-p28.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iv-p29">
<scripRef passage="1 Tim. iii. 7" id="iv.iv-p29.1" parsed="|1Tim|3|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.3.7">1 Tim. iii. 7</scripRef>.</p></note> he does not dispense with an exact
and rigorous inquiry, nor does he assign to such testimony
precedence over the scrutiny required in such cases. For after much
previous discourse, he mentioned this additional testimony, proving
that one must not be contented with it alone for elections of this
kind, but take it into consideration along with the rest. For
public report often speaks false; but when careful investigation
precedes, no further danger need be apprehended from it. On this
account, after the other kinds of evidence he places that which
comes from those who are without. For he did not simply say, “he
must have a good report,” but added the 
<pb n="43" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_43.html" id="iv.iv-Page_43" />words, “from them which are without,” wishing
to show that before the report of those without he must be
carefully examined. Inasmuch, then, as I myself knew your affairs
better than your parents, as you also yourself acknowledged, I
might deserve to be released from all blame.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iv-p30"><span class="c12" id="iv.iv-p30.1">Basil</span>: Nay this is the very
reason why you could not escape, if any one chose to indite you. Do
you not remember hearing from me, and often learning from my actual
conduct, the feebleness of my character? Were you not perpetually
taunting me for my pusillanimity, because I was so easily dejected
by ordinary cares?</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iv-p31">5. <span class="c12" id="iv.iv-p31.1">Chrysostom</span>: I do
indeed remember often hearing such things said by you; I would not
deny it. But if I ever taunted you, I did it in sport and not in
serious truth. However, I do not now dispute about these matters,
and I claim the same degree of forbearance from you while I wish to
make mention of some of the good qualities which you possess. For
if you attempt to convict me of saying what is untrue, I shall not
spare you, but shall prove that you say these things rather by way
of self-depreciation than with a view to truth, and I will employ
no evidence but your own words and deeds to demonstrate the truth
of my assertion. And now the first question I wish to ask of you is
this: do you know how great the power of love is? For omitting all
the miracles which were to be wrought by the apostles, Christ said,
“Hereby shall men know that ye are my disciples if ye love one
another,”<note place="end" n="82" id="iv.iv-p31.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iv-p32">
<scripRef passage="John xiii. 35" id="iv.iv-p32.1" parsed="|John|13|35|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.13.35">John xiii. 35</scripRef>.</p></note> and Paul said
that it was the fulfilling of the law,<note place="end" n="83" id="iv.iv-p32.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iv-p33">

spiritual gift had any profit. Well, this choice good, the
distinguishing mark of Christ’s disciples, the gift which is
higher than all other gifts, I perceived to be deeply implanted in
your soul, and teeming with much fruit.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iv-p34"><span class="c12" id="iv.iv-p34.1">Basil</span>: I acknowledge indeed
that the matter is one of deep concern to me, and that I endeavor
most earnestly to keep this commandment, but that I have not even
half succeeded in so doing, even you yourself would bear me witness
if you would leave off talking out of partiality, and simply
respect the truth.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iv-p35">6. <span class="c12" id="iv.iv-p35.1">Chrysostom</span>: Well,
then, I shall betake myself to my evidences, and shall now do what
I threatened, proving that you wish to disparage yourself rather
than to speak the truth. But I will mention a fact which has only
just occurred, that no one may suspect me of attempting to obscure
the truth by the great lapse of time in relating events long past,
as oblivion would then prevent any objection being made to the
things which I might say with a view to gratification.<note place="end" n="84" id="iv.iv-p35.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iv-p36">
The passage is awkwardly expressed in the original. What Chrysostom
says is that he will mention an event which has recently occurred
as an evidence of Basil’s character, because if he referred to
events which were no longer fresh in people’s recollection, the
accuracy of his statements could not be tested, and he might be
suspected of partiality.</p></note> For when one of our intimate
friends, having been falsely accused of insult and folly, was in
extreme peril, you then flung yourself into the midst of the
danger, although you were not summoned by any one, or appealed to
by the person who was about to be involved in danger. Such was the
fact: but that I may convict you out of your own mouth, I will
remind you of the words you uttered: for when some did not approve
of this zeal, while others commended and admired it, “How can I
help myself?” you said to those who accused you, “for I do not
know how otherwise to love than by giving up my life when it is
necessary to save any of my friends who is in danger:” thus
repeating, in different words, indeed, but with the same meaning,
what Christ said to his disciples when he laid down the definition
of perfect love. “Greater love,” He said, “hath no man than
this that a man lay down his life for his friends.” If then it is
impossible to find greater love than this, you have attained its
limit, and both by your deeds and words have crowned the summit.
This is why I betrayed you, this is why I contrived that plot. Do I
now convince you that it was not from any malicious intent, nor
from any desire to thrust you into danger, but from a persuasion of
your future usefulness that I dragged you into this
course?</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iv-p37"><span class="c12" id="iv.iv-p37.1">Basil</span>: Do you then suppose
that love is sufficient for the correction of one’s
fellowmen?</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iv-p38"><span class="c12" id="iv.iv-p38.1">Chrysostom</span>: Certainly it
would contribute in a great measure to this end. But if you wish me
to produce evidence of your practical wisdom also, I will proceed
to do so, and will prove that your understanding exceeds your
lovingkindness.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iv-p39">At these remarks he blushed scarlet and said, “Let
my character be now dismissed: for it was not about this that I
originally demanded an explanation; but if you have any just answer
to make to those who are without, I would gladly hear what you have
to say. Wherefore, abandoning this vain contest, tell me what
defence I shall make, both to those who have honored you and to
those who are distressed on their account, considering them to be
insulted.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iv-p40">7. <span class="c12" id="iv.iv-p40.1">Chrysostom</span>: This
is just the point to which I am finally hastening, for as my
ex<pb n="44" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_44.html" id="iv.iv-Page_44" />planation to you has
been completed I shall easily turn to this part of my defence. What
then is the accusation made by these persons, and what are their
charges? They say that they have been insulted and grievously
wronged by me because I have not accepted the honor which they
wished to confer upon me. Now in the first place I say that no
account should be taken of the insult shown to men, seeing that by
paying honor to them I should be compelled to offend God. And I
should say to those who are displeased that it is not safe to take
offence at these things, but does them much harm. For I think that
those who stay themselves on God and look to Him alone, ought to be
so religiously disposed as not to account such a thing an insult,
even if they happened to be a thousand times dishonored. But that I
have not gone so far as even to think of daring anything of this
kind is manifest from what I am about to say. For if indeed I had
been induced by arrogance and vainglory, as you have often said
some slanderously affirm, to assent to my accusers, I should have
been one of the most iniquitous of mankind, having treated great
and excellent men, my benefactors moreover, with contempt. For if
men ought to be punished for wronging those who have never wronged
them, how ought we to honor those who have spontaneously preferred
to honor us? For no one could possibly say that they were requiting
me for any benefits small or great which they had received at my
hands. How great a punishment then would one deserve if one
requited them in the contrary manner. But if such a thing never
entered my mind, and I declined the heavy burden with quite a
different intention, why do they refuse to pardon me (even if they
do not consent to approve), but accuse me of having selfishly
spared my own soul? For so far from having insulted the men in
question I should say that I had even honored them by my
refusal.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iv-p41">And do not be surprised at the paradoxical nature of
my remark, for I shall supply a speedy solution of it.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iv-p42">8. For had I accepted the office, I do not say
all men, but those who take pleasure in speaking evil, might have
suspected and said many things concerning myself who had been
elected and concerning them, the electors: for instance, that they
regarded wealth, and admired splendor of rank, or had been induced
by flattery to promote me to this honor: indeed I cannot say
whether some one might not have suspected that they were bribed by
money. Moreover, they would have said, “Christ called fishermen,
tentmakers, and publicans to this dignity, whereas these men reject
those who support themselves by daily labor: but if there be any
one who devotes himself to secular learning, and is brought up in
idleness, him they receive and admire. For why, pray, have they
passed by men who have undergone innumerable toils in the service
of the Church, and suddenly dragged into this dignity one who has
never experienced any labors of this kind, but has spent all his
youth in the vain study of secular learning.” These things and
more they might have said had I accepted the office: but not so
now. For every pretext for maligning is now cut away from them, and
they can neither accuse me of flattery, nor the others of receiving
bribes, unless some choose to act like mere madmen. For how could
one who used flattery and expended money in order to obtain the
dignity, have abandoned it to others when he might have obtained
it? For this would be just as if a man who had bestowed much labor
upon the ground in order that the corn field might be laden with
abundant produce, and the presses overflow with wine, after
innumerable toils and great expenditure of money were to surrender
the fruits to others just when it was time to reap his corn and
gather in his vintage. Do you see that although what was said might
be far from the truth, nevertheless those who wished to calumniate
the electors would then have had a pretext for alleging that the
choice was made without fair judgment and consideration. But as it
is I have prevented them from being open mouthed, or even uttering
a single word on the subject. Such then and more would have been
their remarks at the outset. But after undertaking the ministry I
should not have been able day by day to defend myself against
accusers, even if I had done everything faultlessly, to say nothing
of the many mistakes which I must have made owing to my youth and
inexperience. But now I have saved the electors from this kind of
accusation also, whereas in the other case I should have involved
them in innumerable reproaches. For what would not the world have
said? “They have committed affairs of such vast interest and
importance to thoughtless youths, they have defiled the flock of
God, and Christian affairs have become a jest and a
laughing-stock.” But now “all iniquity shall stop her
mouth.”<note place="end" n="85" id="iv.iv-p42.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iv-p43">

<p class="c9" id="iv.v-p2">1. <span class="c12" id="iv.v-p2.1">Chrysostom</span>: As
regards the insult to those who have done me honor, what I have
already said might be sufficient to prove that in avoiding this
office I had no desire to put them to shame; but I will now
endeavor to make it evident, to the best of my ability, that I was
not puffed up by arrogance of any kind. For if the choice of a
generalship or a kingdom had been submitted to me, and I had then
formed this resolution, any one might naturally have suspected me
of this fault, or rather I should have been found guilty by all
men, not of arrogance, but of senseless folly. But when the
priesthood is offered to me, which exceeds a kingdom as much as the
spirit differs from the flesh, will any one dare to accuse me of
disdain? And is it not preposterous to charge with folly those who
reject small things, but when any do this in matters of pre-eminent
importance, to exempt such persons from accusations of mental
derangement, and yet subject them to the charge of pride? It is
just as if one were to accuse, not of pride, but of insanity, a man
who looked with contempt on a herd of oxen and refused to be a
herdsman, and yet were to say that a man who declined the empire of
the world, and the command of all the armies of the earth, was not
mad, but inflated with pride. But this assuredly is not the case;
and they who say such things do not injure me more than they injure
themselves. For merely to imagine it possible for human nature to
despise this dignity is an evidence against those who bring this
charge of the estimate which they have formed of the office. For if
they did not consider it to be an ordinary thing of no great
account, such a suspicion as this would never have entered their
heads. For why is it that no one has ever dared to entertain such a
suspicion with reference to the dignity of the angels, and to say
that arrogance is the reason why human nature would not aspire to
the rank of the angelic nature? It is because we imagine great
things concerning those powers, and this does not suffer us to
believe that a man can conceive anything greater than that honor.
Wherefore one might with more justice indite those persons of
arrogance who accuse me of it. For they would never have suspected
this of others if they had not previously depreciated the matter as
being of no account. But if they say that I have done this with a
view to glory, they will be convicted of fighting openly against
themselves and falling into their own snare; for I do not
know <pb n="46" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_46.html" id="iv.v-Page_46" />what kind of
arguments they could have sought in preference to these if they had
wished to release me from the charge of vainglory.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.v-p3">2. For if this desire had ever entered my mind, I
ought to have accepted the office rather than avoided it. Why?
because it would have brought me much glory. For the fact that one
of my age, who had so recently abandoned secular pursuits, should
suddenly be deemed by all worthy of such admiration as to be
advanced to honor before those who have spent all their life in
labors of this kind, and to obtain more votes than all of them,
might have persuaded all men to anticipate great and marvellous
things of me. But, as it is, the greater part of the Church does
not know me even by name: so that even my refusal of the office
will not be manifest to all, but only to a few, and I am not sure
that all even of these know it for certain; but probably many of
them either imagine that I was not elected at all, or that I was
rejected after the election, being considered unsuitable, not that
I avoided the office of my own accord.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.v-p4">3. <span class="c12" id="iv.v-p4.1">Basil</span>: But those
who do know the truth will be surprised.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.v-p5"><span class="c12" id="iv.v-p5.1">Chrysostom</span>: And lo! these
are they who, according to you, falsely accuse me of vainglory and
pride. Whence then am I to hope for praise? From the many? They do
not know the actual fact. From the few? Here again the matter is
perverted to my disadvantage. For the only reason why you have come
here now is to learn what answer ought to be given to them. And
what shall I now certainly say on account of these things? For wait
a little, and you will clearly perceive that even if all know the
truth they ought not to condemn me for pride and love of glory. And
in addition to this there is another consideration: that not only
those who make this venture, if there be any such (which for my
part I do not believe), but also those who suspect it of others,
will be involved in no small danger.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.v-p6">4. For the priestly office is indeed
discharged on earth, but it ranks amongst heavenly ordinances; and
very naturally so: for neither man, nor angel, nor archangel, nor
any other created power, but the Paraclete Himself, instituted this
vocation, and persuaded men while still abiding in the flesh to
represent the ministry of angels. Wherefore the consecrated priest
ought to be as pure as if he were standing in the heavens
themselves in the midst of those powers. Fearful, indeed, and of
most awful import, were the things which were used before the
dispensation of grace, as the bells, the pomegranates, the stones
on the breastplate and on the ephod, the girdle, the mitre, the
long robe, the plate of gold, the holy of holies, the deep silence
within.<note place="end" n="86" id="iv.v-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.v-p7">

should examine the things which belong to the dispensation of
grace, he will find that, small as they are, yet are they fearful
and full of awe, and that what was spoken concerning the law is
true in this case also, that “what has been made glorious hath no
glory in this respect by reason of the glory which excelleth.”<note place="end" n="87" id="iv.v-p7.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.v-p8">

sacrificed, and laid upon the altar,<note place="end" n="88" id="iv.v-p8.2"><p id="iv.v-p9"> The Holy Eucharist is
frequently called by St. Chrysostom and other Greek Fathers the
Sacrifice, sometimes the “unbloody Sacrifice,” partly as being
an offering of praise and thanksgiving, partly as being a
commemoration or representation of the sacrifice of Christ. We must
bear in mind that no controversy had then arisen about this
Sacrament, and that writers could freely use expressions which in
later times would have been liable to objection or
misconstruction.</p>

<p class="MsoEndnoteText" id="iv.v-p10">The passage before us must be read in
the light of other passages in Chrysostom’s works; but one of
these is sufficient to indicate the sense in which it is to be
understood. In Homily xvii. c. 3. on the Epistle to the Hebrews,
after contrasting the many and ineffectual sacrifices of the Jews
with the one perfect and efficient sacrifice of Christ, he
proceeds, “What then? do we not make an offering every day? We
do, certainly, but by making a memorial of His death; and this
memorial is one, not many. How one, not many? Because the sacrifice
was offered once for all, as that great sacrifice was in the Holy
of Holies. This is a figure of that great sacrifice, as that was of
this: for we do not offer one victim to-day and another to-morrow,
but always the same: wherefore the sacrifice is one. Well, then, as
He is offered in many places, are there many Christs? No, by no
means, but everywhere one Christ, complete both in this world and
in the other, one body. As then, though offered in many places, He
is but one body, so is there but one sacrifice. Our High Priest is
He who offers the sacrifice which cleanses us. We offer that now
which was offered then: which is indeed inconsumable. This takes
place now, for a memorial of what took place then. ‘Do this,’
said He, ‘for my memorial.’ We do not then offer a different
sacrifice, as the high priest formerly did, but always the same; or
rather we celebrate a memorial of a sacrifice.”</p></note> and the priest standing and praying
over the victim, and all the worshippers empurpled with that
precious blood,<note place="end" n="89" id="iv.v-p10.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.v-p11">
This may be only a rhetorical expression, but perhaps there is an
allusion to a custom which prevailed in some churches, that the
worshippers after receiving the cup applied the finger to the
moistened lip, and then touched their breast, eyes and ears.</p></note> canst thou
then think that thou art still amongst men, and standing upon the
earth? Art thou not, on the contrary, straightway translated to
Heaven, and casting out every carnal thought from the soul, dost
thou not with disembodied spirit and pure reason contemplate the
things which are in Heaven? Oh! what a marvel! what love of God to
man! He who sitteth on high with the Father is at that hour held in
the hands of all,<note place="end" n="90" id="iv.v-p11.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.v-p12">
The caution mentioned just now in note 3 must be repeated
here. A comparison of passages in the writings of Chrysostom and
his contemporaries proves clearly enough that they did not hold
that the elements of bread and wine were transmuted into the body
and blood of Christ in such a sense as to cease to be bread and
wine. The authenticity of the letter of Chrysostom to Cæsarius is
doubtful, but whoever the writer may have been, he is clearly
representing the current orthodox belief of the Church in his day.
He maintains, in opposition to the Apollinarian or perhaps the
Eutychian heresy, that there are two complete natures in the one
person of God the Son Incarnate, and illustrates it by the
following reference to the holy elements in the Eucharist: “Just
as the bread before consecration is called bread, but when the
Divine Grace sanctifies it through the agency of the priest it is
released from the appellation of bread, and is deemed worthy of the
appellation of the ‘Lord’s Body,’ <i>although the nature of
bread remains in it</i>, and we speak not of two bodies, but one
body of the Son: so here the Divine nature being seated in the
human body, the two together make up but one Son—one
Person.”</p></note> and gives
Himself to those who are willing to embrace and grasp Him. And this
all do through <pb n="47" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_47.html" id="iv.v-Page_47" />the
eyes of faith!<note place="end" n="91" id="iv.v-p12.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.v-p13">
Some <span class="c12" id="iv.v-p13.1">mss</span>. omit the word <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.v-p13.2">πίστεως</span> “of faith,” having in its
place <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.v-p13.3">τότε</span> “at that
time.”</p></note> Do these
things seem to you fit to be despised, or such as to make it
possible for any one to be uplifted against them?</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.v-p14">Would you also learn from another miracle the
exceeding sanctity of this office? Picture Elijah and the vast
multitude standing around him, and the sacrifice laid upon the
altar of stones, and all the rest of the people hushed into a deep
silence while the prophet alone offers up prayer: then the sudden
rush of fire from Heaven upon the sacrifice:—these are marvellous
things, charged with terror. Now then pass from this scene to the
rites which are celebrated in the present day; they are not only
marvellous to behold, but transcendent in terror. There stands the
priest, not bringing down fire from Heaven, but the Holy Spirit:
and he makes prolonged supplication,<note place="end" n="92" id="iv.v-p14.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.v-p15">
In the Liturgy which bears the name of St. Chrysostom, the
following invocation of the Holy Spirit occurs: “Grant that we
may find grace in thy sight that our sacrifice may become
acceptable to Thee, and that the Good Spirit of thy grace may rest
upon us, and upon these gifts spread before Thee, and upon all Thy
people,” and presently the deacon bids the people, “Let us pray
on behalf of the precious gifts (<i>i.e</i>., the bread and wine)
which have been provided, that the merciful God who has received
them upon His holy spiritual altar beyond the heavens may in return
send down upon us the divine grace and the fellowship of the Holy
Ghost.”</p></note> not that some flame sent down from
on high may consume the offerings, but that grace descending on the
sacrifice may thereby enlighten the souls of all, and render them
more refulgent than silver purified by fire. Who can despise this
most awful mystery, unless he is stark mad and senseless? Or do you
not know that no human soul could have endured that fire in the
sacrifice, but all would have been utterly consumed, had not the
assistance of God’s grace been great.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.v-p16">5. For if any one will consider how great a
thing it is for one, being a man, and compassed with flesh and
blood, to be enabled to draw nigh to that blessed and pure nature,
he will then clearly see what great honor the grace of the Spirit
has vouchsafed to priests; since by their agency these rites are
celebrated, and others nowise inferior to these both in respect of
our dignity and our salvation. For they who inhabit the earth and
make their abode there are entrusted with the administration of
things which are in Heaven, and have received an authority which
God has not given to angels or archangels. For it has not been said
to them, “Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in
Heaven, and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in
Heaven.”<note place="end" n="93" id="iv.v-p16.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.v-p17">
<scripRef passage="Matt. xviii. 18" id="iv.v-p17.1" parsed="|Matt|18|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.18.18">Matt. xviii. 18</scripRef>.</p></note> They who rule
on earth have indeed authority to bind, but only the body: whereas
this binding lays hold of the soul and penetrates the heavens; and
what priests do here below God ratifies above, and the Master
confirms the sentence of his servants. For indeed what is it but
all manner of heavenly authority which He has given them when He
says, “Whose sins ye remit they are remitted, and whose sins ye
retain they are retained?”<note place="end" n="94" id="iv.v-p17.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.v-p18">

What authority could be greater than this? “The Father hath
committed all judgment to the Son?”<note place="end" n="95" id="iv.v-p18.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.v-p19">
<scripRef passage="John v. 22" id="iv.v-p19.1" parsed="|John|5|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.5.22">John v. 22</scripRef>.</p></note> But I see it all put into the hands
of these men by the Son. For they have been conducted to this
dignity as if they were already translated to Heaven, and had
transcended human nature, and were released from the passions to
which we are liable. Moreover, if a king should bestow this honor
upon any of his subjects, authorizing him to cast into prison whom
he pleased and to release them again, he becomes an object of envy
and respect to all men; but he who has received from God an
authority as much greater as heaven is more precious than earth,
and souls more precious than bodies, seems to some to have received
so small an honor that they are actually able to imagine that one
of those who have been entrusted with these things will despise the
gift. Away with such madness! For transparent madness it is to
despise so great a dignity, without which it is not possible to
obtain either our own salvation, or the good things which have been
promised to us. For if no one can enter into the kingdom of Heaven
except he be regenerate through water and the Spirit, and he who
does not eat the flesh of the Lord and drink His blood is excluded
from eternal life, and if all these things are accomplished only by
means of those holy hands, I mean the hands of the priest, how will
any one, without these, be able to escape the fire of hell, or to
win those crowns which are reserved for the victorious?</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.v-p20">6. These verily are they who are entrusted with the
pangs of spiritual travail and the birth which comes through
baptism: by their means we put on Christ, and are buried with the
Son of God, and become members of that blessed Head. Wherefore they
might not only be more justly feared by us than rulers and kings,
but also be more honored than parents; since these begat us of
blood and the will of the flesh, but the others are the authors of
our birth from God, even that blessed regeneration which is the
true freedom and the sonship according to grace. The Jewish priests
had authority to release the body from leprosy, or, rather, not to
release it but only to examine those who were already released, and
you know how much the office of priest 
<pb n="48" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_48.html" id="iv.v-Page_48" />was contended for at that time. But our
priests have received authority to deal, not with bodily leprosy,
but spiritual uncleanness—not to pronounce it removed after
examination, but actually and absolutely to take it away. Wherefore
they who despise these priests would be far more accursed than
Dathan and his company, and deserve more severe punishment. For the
latter, although they laid claim to the dignity which did not
belong to them, nevertheless had an excellent opinion concerning
it, and this they evinced by the great eagerness with which they
pursued it; but these men, when the office has been better
regulated, and has received so great a development, have displayed
an audacity which exceeds that of the others, although manifested
in a contrary way. For there is not an equal amount of contempt
involved in aiming at an honor which does not pertain to one, and
in despising such great advantages, but the latter exceeds the
former as much as scorn differs from admiration. What soul then is
so sordid as to despise such great advantages? None whatever, I
should say, unless it were one subject to some demoniacal impulse.
For I return once more to the point from which I started: not in
the way of chastising only, but also in the way of benefiting, God
has bestowed a power on priests greater than that of our natural
parents. The two indeed differ as much as the present and the
future life. For our natural parents generate us unto this life
only, but the others unto that which is to come. And the former
would not be able to avert death from their offspring, or to repel
the assaults of disease; but these others have often saved a sick
soul, or one which was on the point of perishing, procuring for
some a milder chastisement, and preventing others from falling
altogether, not only by instruction and admonition, but also by the
assistance wrought through prayers. For not only at the time of
regeneration, but afterwards also, they have authority to forgive
sins. “Is any sick among you?” it is said, “let him call for
the elders of the Church and let them pray over him, anointing him
with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer of faith shall
save the sick, and the Lord will raise him up: and if he have
committed sins they shall be forgiven him.”<note place="end" n="96" id="iv.v-p20.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.v-p21">

their children come into conflict with any men of high rank and
great power in the world, are unable to profit them: but priests
have reconciled, not rulers and kings, but God Himself when His
wrath has often been provoked against them.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.v-p22">Well! after this will any one venture to condemn me
for arrogance? For my part, after what has been said, I imagine
such religious fear will possess the souls of the hearers that they
will no longer condemn those who avoid the office for arrogance and
temerity, but rather those who voluntarily come forward and are
eager to obtain this dignity for themselves. For if they who have
been entrusted with the command of cities, should they chance to be
wanting in discretion and vigilance, have sometimes destroyed the
cities and ruined themselves in addition, how much power think you
both in himself and from above must he need, to avoid sinning,
whose business it is to beautify the Bride of Christ?</p>

brazier, or a shoemaker, or some such artisan, and entrust the army
to his hands, I should not praise the wretched man if he did not
take to flight, and do all in his power to avoid plunging into such
manifest trouble. If, indeed, it be sufficient to bear the name of
pastor, and to take the work in hand hap-hazard, and there be no
danger in this, then let whoso pleases accuse me of vainglory; but
if it behoves one who undertakes this care to have much
understanding, and, before understanding, great grace from God, and
uprightness of conduct, and purity of life and superhuman virtue,
do not deprive me of forgiveness if I am unwilling to perish in

<p class="c10" id="iv.v-p30">Moreover, if any one in charge of a full-sized
merchant ship, full of rowers, and laden with a costly freight,
were to station me at the helm and bid me cross the Ægean or the

one asked me why? I should say, “Lest I should sink the ship.”
Well, where the loss concerns material wealth, and the danger
extends only to bodily death, no one will blame those who exercise
great prudence; but where the shipwrecked are destined to fall, not
into the ocean, but into the abyss of fire, and the death which
awaits them is not that which severs the soul from the body, but
one which together with this dismisses it to eternal punishment,
shall I incur your wrath and hate because I did not plunge headlong
into so great an evil?</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.v-p31">8. Do not thus, I pray and beseech you. I know my
own soul, how feeble and puny it is: I know the magnitude of this
ministry, and the great difficulty of the work; for more stormy
billows vex the soul of the priest than the gales which disturb the
sea.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.v-p32">9. And first of all is that most terrible rock of
vainglory, more dangerous than that of the Sirens, of which the
fable-mongers tell such marvellous tales: for many were able to
sail past that and escape unscathed; but this is to me so dangerous
that even now, when no necessity of any kind impels me into that
abyss, I am unable to keep clear of the snare: but if any one were
to commit this charge to me, it would be all the same as if he tied
my hands behind my back, and delivered me to the wild beasts
dwelling on that rock to rend me in pieces day by day. Do you ask
what those wild beasts are? They are wrath, despondency, envy,
strife, slanders, accusations, falsehood, hypocrisy, intrigues,
anger against those who have done no harm, pleasure at the
indecorous acts of fellow ministers, sorrow at their prosperity,
love of praise, desire of honor (which indeed most of all drives
the human soul headlong to perdition), doctrines devised to please,
servile flatteries, ignoble fawning, contempt of the poor, paying
court to the rich, senseless and mischievous honors, favors
attended with danger both to those who offer and those who accept
them, sordid fear suited only to the basest of slaves, the
abolition of plain speaking, a great affectation of humility, but
banishment of truth, the suppression of convictions and reproofs,
or rather the excessive use of them against the poor, while against
those who are invested with power no one dare open his lips.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.v-p33">For all these wild beasts, and more than
these, are bred upon that rock of which I have spoken, and those
whom they have once captured are inevitably dragged down into such
a depth of servitude that even to please women they often do many
things which it is well not to mention. The divine law indeed has
excluded women from the ministry, but they endeavor to thrust
themselves into it; and since they can effect nothing of
themselves, they do all through the agency of others; and they have
become invested with so much power that they can appoint or eject
priests at their will:<note place="end" n="103" id="iv.v-p33.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.v-p34"> Chrysostom himself experienced the truth of this,
for it was through the influence of Eudoxia, the wife of the
Emperor Arcadius, that he was deposed from the See of
Constantinople and banished.</p></note> things in fact are turned upside
down, and the proverbial saying may be seen realized—“The ruled
lead the rulers:” and would that it were men who do this instead
of women, who have not received a commission to teach. Why do I say
teach? for the blessed Paul did not suffer them even to speak in
the Church.<note place="end" n="104" id="iv.v-p34.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.v-p35"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. xiv. 34; 1 Tim. ii. 12" id="iv.v-p35.1" parsed="|1Cor|14|34|0|0;|1Tim|2|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.14.34 Bible:1Tim.2.12">1 Cor.

heard some one say that they have obtained such a large privilege
of free speech, as even to rebuke the prelates of the Churches, and
censure them more severely than masters do their own
domestics.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.v-p36">10. And let not any one suppose that I subject all
to the aforesaid charges: for there are some, yea many, who are
superior to these entanglements, and exceed in number those who
have been caught by them. Nor would I indeed make the priesthood
responsible for these evils: far be such madness from me. For men
of understanding do not say that the sword is to blame for murder,
nor wine for drunkenness, nor strength for outrage, nor courage for
foolhardiness, but they lay the blame on those who make an improper
use of the gifts which have been bestowed upon them by God, and
punish them accordingly. Certainly, at least, the priesthood may
justly accuse us <pb n="50" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_50.html" id="iv.v-Page_50" />if we do
not rightly handle it. For it is not itself a cause of the evils
already mentioned, but we, who as far as lies in our power have
defiled it with so many pollutions, by entrusting it to commonplace
men who readily accept what is offered them, without having first
acquired a knowledge of their own souls, or considered the gravity
of the office, and when they have entered on the work, being
blinded by inexperience, overwhelm with innumerable evils the
people who have been committed to their care. This is the very
thing which was very nearly happening in my case, had not God
speedily delivered me from those dangers, mercifully sparing his
Church and my own soul. For, tell me, whence do you think such
great troubles are generated in the Churches? I, for my part,
believe the only source of them to be the inconsiderate and random
way in which prelates are chosen and appointed. For the head ought
to be the strongest part, that it may be able to regulate and
control the evil exhalations which arise from the rest of the body
below; but when it happens to be weak in itself, and unable to
repel those pestiferous attacks, it becomes feebler itself than it
really is, and ruins the rest of the body as well. And to prevent
this now coming to pass, God kept me in the position of the feet,
which was the rank originally assigned to me. For there are very
many other qualities, Basil, besides those already mentioned, which
the priest ought to have, but which I do not possess; and, above
all, this one:—his soul ought to be thoroughly purged from any
lust after the office: for if he happens to have a natural
inclination for this dignity, as soon as he attains it a stronger
flame is kindled, and the man being taken completely captive will
endure innumerable evils in order to keep a secure hold upon it,
even to the extent of using flattery, or submitting to something
base and ignoble, or expending large sums of money. For I will not
now speak of the murders with which some have filled the
Churches,<note place="end" n="105" id="iv.v-p36.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.v-p37"> Possibly the building, not the body of Christians
is here signified: for in the contest between Damasus and Ursicinus
for the See of Rome, A.D. 367, which Chrysostom probably had in his
mind, 137 persons are said to have been slain in one of the
Churches in a single day.</p></note> or the
desolation which they have brought upon cities in contending for
the dignity, lest some persons should think what I say incredible.
But I am of opinion one ought to exercise so much caution in the
matter, as to shun the burden of the office,<note place="end" n="106" id="iv.v-p37.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.v-p38"> According to another reading the passage must be
rendered, “shun the burden at the outset.”</p></note> and when one has entered upon it,
not to wait for the judgment of others should any fault be
committed which warrants deposition, but to anticipate it by
ejecting oneself from the dignity; for thus one might probably win
mercy for himself from God: but to cling to it in defiance of
propriety is to deprive oneself of all forgiveness, or rather to
kindle the wrath of God, by adding a second error more offensive
than the first.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.v-p39">11. But no one will always endure the strain;
for fearful, truly fearful is the eager desire after this honor.
And in saying this I am not in opposition to the blessed Paul, but
in complete harmony with his words. For what says he? “If any man
desireth the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work.”<note place="end" n="107" id="iv.v-p39.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.v-p40"> <scripRef passage="1 Tim. iii. 1" id="iv.v-p40.1" parsed="|1Tim|3|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.3.1">1 Tim.
iii. 1</scripRef>.</p></note> Now I have
not said that it is a terrible thing to desire the <i>work,</i> but
only the authority and power. And this desire I think one ought to
expel from the soul with all possible earnestness, not permitting
it at the outset to be possessed by such a feeling, so that one may
be able to do everything with freedom. For he who does not desire
to be exhibited in possession of this authority, does not fear to
be deposed from it, and not fearing this will be able to do
everything with the freedom which becomes Christian men: whereas
they who fear and tremble lest they should be deposed undergo a
bitter servitude, filled with all kinds of evils, and are often
compelled to offend against both God and man. Now the soul ought
not to be affected in this way; but as in warfare we see those
soldiers who are noble-spirited fight willingly and fall bravely,
so they who have attained to this stewardship should be contented
to be consecrated to the dignity or removed from it, as becomes
Christian men, knowing that deposition of this kind brings its
reward no less than the discharge of the office. For when any one
suffers anything of this kind, in order to avoid submitting to
something which is unbecoming or unworthy of this dignity, he
procures punishment for those who wrongfully depose him, and a
greater reward for himself. “Blessed,” says our Lord, “are ye
when men shall revile you and persecute you, and shall say all
manner of evil against you falsely for my sake; rejoice and be
exceeding glad, for great is your reward in Heaven.”<note place="end" n="108" id="iv.v-p40.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.v-p41"> <scripRef passage="Matt. v. 1" id="iv.v-p41.1" parsed="|Matt|5|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.1">Matt. v.
1</scripRef>.</p></note> And this,
indeed, is the case when any one is expelled by those of his own
rank either on account of envy, with a view to the favor of others,
or through hatred, or from any other wrong motive: but when it is
the lot of any one to experience this treatment at the hand of
opponents, I do not think a word is needed to prove what great gain
they confer upon him by their wickedness.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.v-p42">It behoves us, then, to be on the watch on all
sides, and to make a careful search lest any 
<pb n="51" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_51.html" id="iv.v-Page_51" />spark of this desire should be secretly
smouldering somewhere. For it is much to be wished that those who
are originally free from this passion, should also be able to avoid
it when they have lighted upon this office. But if any one, before
he obtains the honor, cherishes in himself this terrible and savage
monster, it is impossible to say into what a furnace he will fling
himself after he has attained it. Now I possessed this desire in a
high degree (and do not suppose that I would ever tell you what was
untrue in self-disparagement): and this, combined with other
reasons, alarmed me not a little, and induced me to take flight.
For just as lovers of the human person, as long as they are
permitted to be near the objects of their affection, suffer more
severe torment from their passion, but when they remove as far as
possible from these objects of desire, they drive away the frenzy:
even so when those who desire this dignity are near it, the evil
becomes intolerable: but when they cease to hope for it, the desire
is extinguished together with the expectation.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.v-p43">12. This single motive then is no slight one: and
even taken by itself it would have sufficed to deter me from this
dignity: but, as it is, another must be added not less than the
former. And what is this? A priest ought to be sober minded, and
penetrating in discernment, and possessed of innumerable eyes in
every direction, as one who lives not for himself alone but for so
great a multitude. But that I am sluggish and slack, and scarcely
able to bring about my own salvation, even you yourself would
admit, who out of love to me art especially eager to conceal my
faults. Talk not to me in this connexion of fasting, and watching,
or sleeping on the ground, and other hard discipline of the body:
for you know how defective I am in these matters: and even if they
had been carefully practised by me they could not with my present
sluggishness have been of any service to me with a view to this
post of authority. Such things might be of great service to a man
who was shut up in a cell, and caring only for his own concerns:
but when a man is divided among so great a multitude, and enters
separately into the private cares of those who are under his
direction, what appreciable help can be given to their improvement
unless he possesses a robust and exceedingly vigorous
character?</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.v-p44">13. And do not be surprised if, in connexion
with such endurance, I seek another test of fortitude in the soul.
For to be indifferent to food and drink and a soft bed, we see is
to many no hard task, especially at least to such as are of a rough
habit of life and have been brought up in this way from early
youth, and to many others also; bodily discipline and custom
softening the severity of these laborious practices: but insult,
and abuse, and coarse language, and gibes from inferiors, whether
wantonly or justly uttered, and rebukes vainly and idly spoken both
by rulers and the ruled—this is what few can bear, in fact only
one or two here and there; and one may see men, who are strong in
the former exercises, so completely upset by these things, as to
become more furious than the most savage beasts. Now such men
especially we should exclude from the precincts of the priesthood.
For if a prelate did not loathe food, or go barefoot, no harm would
be done to the common interests of the Church; but a furious temper
causes great disasters both to him who possesses it, and to his
neighbours. And there is no divine threat against those who fail to
do the things referred to, but hell and hell-fire are threatened
against those who are angry without a cause.<note place="end" n="109" id="iv.v-p44.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.v-p45"> <scripRef passage="Matt. v. 22" id="iv.v-p45.1" parsed="|Matt|5|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.22">Matt. v.

when he takes upon him the government of numbers, supplies
additional fuel to the fire, so he who by himself, or in the
company of a few, is unable to control his anger, but readily
carried away by it, should he be entrusted with the direction of a
whole multitude, like some wild beast goaded on all sides by
countless tormentors, would never be able to live in tranquillity
himself, and would cause incalculable mischief to those who have
been committed to his charge.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.v-p46">14. For nothing clouds the purity of the
reason, and the perspicuity of the mental vision so much as
undisciplined wrath, rushing along with violent impetuosity. “For
wrath,” says one, “destroys even the prudent.”<note place="end" n="110" id="iv.v-p46.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.v-p47"> <scripRef passage="Prov. xv. 1" id="iv.v-p47.1" parsed="|Prov|15|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Prov.15.1">Prov. xv.

of the soul being darkened as in some nocturnal battle is not able
to distinguish friends from foes, nor the honorable from the
unworthy, but handles them all in turn in the same way; even if
some harm must be suffered, readily enduring everything, in order
to satisfy the pleasure of the soul. For the fire of wrath is a
kind of pleasure, and tyrannizes over the soul more harshly than
pleasure, completely upsetting its healthy organization. For it
easily impels men to arrogance, and unseasonable enmities, and
unreasonable hatred, and it continually makes them ready to commit
wanton and vain offences; and forces them to say and do many other
things of that kind, the soul being swept along by the rush of
passion, and having nothing on which to fasten its strength and
resist so great an impulse.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.v-p48"><span class="c12" id="iv.v-p48.1">Basil</span>: I will not endure

wish to bring me near the pyre, and to provoke the wild beast when
he is tranquil? Are you not aware that I have achieved this
condition, not by any innate virtue, but by my love of retirement?
and that when one who is so constituted remains contented by
himself, or only associates with one or two friends, he is able to
escape the fire which arises from this passion, but not if he has
plunged into the abyss of all these cares? for then he drags not
only himself but many others with him to the brink of destruction,
and renders them more indifferent to all consideration for
mildness. For the mass of people under government are generally
inclined to regard the manners of those who govern as a kind of
model type, and to assimilate themselves to them. How then could
any one put a stop to their fury when he is swelling himself with
rage? And who amongst the multitude would straightway desire to
become moderate when he sees the ruler irritable? For it is quite
impossible for the defects of priests to be concealed, but even
trifling ones speedily become manifest. So an athlete, as long as
he remains at home, and contends with no one, can dissemble his
weakness even if it be very great, but when he strips for the
contest he is easily detected. And thus for some who live this
private and inactive life, their isolation serves as a veil to hide
their defects; but when they have been brought into public they are
compelled to divest themselves of this mantle of seclusion, and to
lay bare their souls to all through their visible movements. As
therefore their right deeds profit many, by provoking them to equal
zeal, so their shortcomings make men more indifferent to the
practice of virtue, and encourage them to indolence in their
endeavours after what is excellent. Wherefore his soul ought to
gleam with beauty on every side, that it may be able to gladden and
to enlighten the souls of those who behold it. For the faults of
ordinary men, being committed as it were in the dark, ruin only
those who practise them: but the errors of a man in a conspicuous
position, and known to many, inflicts a common injury upon all,
rendering those who have fallen more supine in their efforts for
good, and driving to desperation those who wish to take heed to
themselves. And apart from these things, the faults of
insignificant men, even if they are exposed, inflict no injury
worth speaking of upon any one: but they who occupy the highest
seat of honor are in the first place plainly visible to all, and if
they err in the smallest matters these trifles seem great to
others: for all men measure the sin, not by the magnitude of the
offence, but by the rank of the offender. Thus the priest ought to
be protected on all sides by a kind of adamantine armour, by
intense earnestness, and perpetual watchfulness concerning his
manner of life, lest some one discovering an exposed and neglected
spot should inflict a deadly wound: for all who surround him are
ready to smite and overthrow him: not enemies only and adversaries,
but many even of those who profess friendship.</p>

the fuel of this fire, but things far more dreadful: for it is no
material fire to which they are subjected, but the all-devouring
flame of envy encompasses them, rising up on every side, and
assailing them, and putting their life to a more searching test
than the fire then was to the bodies of those young men. When then
it finds a little trace of stubble, it speedily fastens upon it;
and this unsound part it entirely consumes, but all the rest of the
fabric, even if it be brighter than the sunbeams, is scorched and
blackened by the smoke. For as long as the life of the priest is
well regulated in every direction, it is invulnerable to plots; but
if he happens to overlook some trifle, as is natural in a human
being, traversing the treacherous ocean of this life, none of his
other good deeds are of any avail in enabling him to escape the
mouths of his accusers; but that little blunder overshadows all the
rest. And all men are ready to pass judgment on the priest as if he
was not a being clothed with flesh, or one who inherited a human
nature, but like an angel, and emancipated from every species of
infirmity. And just as all men fear and flatter a tyrant as long as
he is strong, because they cannot put him down, but when they see
his affairs going adversely, those who were his friends a short
time before abandon their hypocritical respect, and suddenly become
his enemies and antagonists, and having discovered all his weak
points, make an attack upon him, and depose him from the
government; so is it also in the case of priests. Those who honored
him and paid court to him a short time before, while he was strong,
as soon as they have found some little handle eagerly prepare to
depose him, not as a tyrant only, but something far more dreadful
than that. And as the tyrant fears his body guards, so also does
the priest dread most of all his neighbours and fellow-ministers.
For no others covet his dignity so much, or know his affairs so
well as these; and if anything occurs, be<pb n="53" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_53.html" id="iv.v-Page_53" />ing near at hand, they perceive
it before others, and even if they slander him, can easily command

after this dignity—is wont to arm many against one who possesses
it. And just as avaricious children are oppressed by the old age of
their parents, so some of these, when they see the priestly office
held by any one for a protracted time—since it would be
wickedness to destroy him—hasten to depose him from it, being all
desirous to take his place, and each expecting that the dignity
will be transferred to himself.</p>

phase of this strife, charged with innumerable dangers? Come, then,
and take a peep at the public festivals when it is generally the
custom for elections to be made to ecclesiastical dignities, and
you will then see the priest assailed with accusations as numerous
as the people whom he rules. For all who have the privilege of
conferring the honor are then split into many parties; and one can
never find the council of elders<note place="end" n="114" id="iv.v-p55.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.v-p56"> It is not possible to say precisely who the
electors to bishoprics were at this time, but probably a mixed body
of the clergy and leading laymen of the diocese. Chrysostom calls
the electors “fathers,” i. ch. 6, and “great men,” ch. 7,
and here he speaks of a “council of elders,” which may mean the
whole body of clergy of the second order, or a select body of
laymen, or possibly the two combined. In one way or other, during
the first five centuries, the people certainly had a considerable
voice in the election of bishops. Socrates, the historian, vi. c.
2, says that Chrysostom himself was chosen for the See of
Constantinople “by the common vote of all, clergy and people.”
Pope Leo (A.D. 440–461) lays down the rule that “when the
election of a bishop is handled he is to be preferred who is
demanded by the unanimous consent of clergy and people.” Epist.

about the man who has won the prelacy; but each stands apart from
the others, one preferring this man, another that. Now the reason
is that they do not all look to one thing, which ought to be the
only object kept in view, the excellence of the character; but
other qualifications are alleged as recommending to this honor; for
instance, of one it is said, “let him be elected because he
belongs to an illustrious family,” of another “because he is
possessed of great wealth, and would not need to be supported out
of the revenues of the Church,” of a third “because he has come
over from the camp of the adversary;” one is eager to give the
preference to a man who is on terms of intimacy with himself,
another to the man who is related to him by birth, a third to the
flatterer, but no one will look to the man who is really qualified,
or make some test of his character. Now I am so far from thinking
these things trustworthy criteria of a man’s fitness for the
priesthood, that even if any one manifested great piety, which is
no small help in the discharge of that office, I should not venture
to approve him on that account alone, unless he happened to combine
good abilities with his piety. For I know many men who have
exercised perpetual restraint upon themselves, and consumed
themselves with fastings, who, as long as they were suffered to be
alone, and attend to their own concerns, have been acceptable to
God, and day by day have made no small addition to this kind of
learning; but as soon as they entered public life, and were
compelled to correct the ignorance of the multitude, have, some of
them, proved from the outset incompetent for so great a task, and
others when forced to persevere in it, have abandoned their former
strict way of living, and thus inflicted great injury on themselves
without profiting others at all. And if any one spent his whole
time in the lowest rank of the ministry, and reached extreme old
age, I would not, merely out of reverence for his years, promote
him to the higher dignity; for what if, after arriving at that time
of life, he should still remain unfit for the office? And I say
this now, not as wishing to dishonor the grey head, nor as laying
down a law absolutely to exclude from this authority those who come
from the monastic circle (for there are instances of many who
issued from that body, having shone conspicuously in this dignity);
but the point which I am anxious to prove is, that if neither piety
of itself, nor advanced age, would suffice to show that a man who
had obtained the priesthood really deserved it, the reasons
formerly alleged would scarcely effect this. There are also men who
bring forward other pretexts yet more 
<pb n="54" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_54.html" id="iv.v-Page_54" />absurd; for some are enrolled in the ranks
of the clergy, that they may not range themselves among opponents,
and others on account of their evil disposition, lest they should
do great mischief if they are overlooked. Could anything be more
contrary to right rule than this? that bad men, laden with
iniquity, should be courted on account of those things for which
they ought to be punished, and ascend to the priestly dignity on
account of things for which they ought to be debarred from the very
threshold of the Church. Tell me, then, shall we seek any further
the cause of God’s wrath, when we expose things so holy and awful
to be defiled by men who are either wicked or worthless? for when
some men are entrusted with the administration of things which are
not at all suitable to them, and others of things which exceed
their natural power, they make the condition of the Church like
that of Euripus.<note place="end" n="115" id="iv.v-p56.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.v-p57"> A narrow strait between the island of Eubœa and
the mainland of Greece, in which the tide was very rapid. Hence the
“condition of Euripus” became a proverbial expression
indicative of agitation and fluctuation.</p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.v-p58">Now formerly I used to deride secular rulers,
because in the distribution of their honors they are not guided by
considerations of moral excellence, but of wealth, and seniority,
and human distinction; but when I heard that this kind of folly had
forced its way into our affairs also, I no longer regarded their
conduct as so atrocious. For what wonder is it that worldly men,
who love the praise of the multitude, and do everything for the
sake of gain, should commit these sins, when those who affect at
least to be free from all these influences are in no wise better
disposed than they, but although engaged in a contest for heavenly
things, act as if the question submitted for decision was one which
concerned acres of land, or something else of that kind? for they
take commonplace men off-hand, and set them to preside over those
things, for the sake of which the only begotten Son of God did not
refuse to empty Himself of His glory and become man, and take the
form of a servant, and be spat upon, and buffeted, and die a death
of reproach in the flesh. Nor do they stop even here, but add to
these offences others still more monstrous; for not only do they
elect unworthy men, but actually expel those who are well
qualified. As if it were necessary to ruin the safety of the Church
on both sides, or as if the former provocation were not sufficient
to kindle the wrath of God, they have contrived yet another not
less pernicious. For I consider it as atrocious to expel the useful
men as to force in the useless. And this in fact takes place, so
that the flock of Christ is unable to find consolation in any
direction, or draw its breath freely. Now do not such deeds deserve
to be punished by ten thousand thunder-bolts, and a hell-fire
hotter than that with which we are threatened [in Holy Scripture]?
Yet these monstrous evils are borne with by Him who willeth not the
death of a sinner, that he may be converted and live. And how can
one sufficiently marvel at His lovingkindness, and be amazed at His
mercy? They who belong to Christ destroy the property of Christ
more than enemies and adversaries, yet the good Lord still deals
gently with them, and calls them to repentance. Glory be to Thee, O
Lord! Glory to Thee! How vast is the depth of Thy lovingkindness!
how great the riches of Thy forbearance! Men who on account of Thy
name have risen from insignificance and obscurity to positions of
honor and distinction, use the honor they enjoy against Him who has
bestowed it, do deeds of outrageous audacity, and insult holy
things, rejecting and expelling men of zeal in order that the
wicked may ruin everything at their pleasure in much security, and
with the utmost fearlessness. And if you would know the causes of
this dreadful evil, you will find that they are similar to those
which were mentioned before; for they have one root and mother, so
to say—namely, envy; but this is manifested in several different
forms. For one we are told is to be struck out of the list of
candidates, because he is young; another because he does not know
how to flatter; a third because he has offended such and such a
person; a fourth lest such and such a man should be pained at
seeing one whom he has presented rejected, and this man elected; a
fifth because he is kind and gentle; a sixth because he is
formidable to the sinful; a seventh for some other like reason; for
they are at no loss to find as many pretexts as they want, and can
even make the abundance of a man’s wealth an objection when they
have no other. Indeed they would be capable of discovering other
reasons, as many as they wish, why a man ought not to be brought
suddenly to this honor, but gently and gradually. And here I should
like to ask the question, “What, then, is the prelate to do, who
has to contend with such blasts? How shall he hold his ground
against such billows? How shall he repel all these assaults?”</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.v-p59">For if he manages the business<note place="end" n="116" id="iv.v-p59.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.v-p60"> <i>i.e</i>., the business of elections. Chrysostom
seems to have passed on from the elections of bishops to the
consideration of elections to clerical offices over which the
bishop had to preside.</p></note> upon upright
principles, all those who are enemies and adversaries both to him
and to the candidates do everything with a view to contention,
provoking daily strife, and heaping infinite <pb n="55" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_55.html" id="iv.v-Page_55" />scorn upon the candidates, until they
have got them struck off the list, or have introduced their own
favorites. In fact it is just as if some pilot had pirates sailing
with him in his ship, perpetually plotting every hour against him,
and the sailors, and marines. And if he should prefer favor with
such men to his own salvation, accepting unworthy candidates, he
will have God for his enemy in their stead; and what could be more
dreadful than that? And yet his relations with them will be more
embarrassing than formerly, as they will all combine with each
other, and thereby become more powerful than before. For as when
fierce winds coming from opposite directions clash with one
another, the ocean, hitherto calm, becomes suddenly furious and
raises its crested waves, destroying those who are sailing over it,
so also when the Church has admitted corrupt men, its once tranquil
surface is covered with rough surf and strewn with shipwrecks.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.v-p61">16. Consider, then, what kind of man he ought to be
who is to hold out against such a tempest, and to manage skillfully
such great hindrances to the common welfare; for he ought to be
dignified yet free from arrogance, formidable yet kind, apt to
command yet sociable, impartial yet courteous, humble yet not
servile, strong yet gentle, in order that he may contend
successfully against all these difficulties. And he ought to bring
forward with great authority the man who is properly qualified for
the office, even if all should oppose him, and with the same
authority to reject the man who is not so qualified, even if all
should conspire in his favor, and to keep one aim only in view, the
building up of the Church, in nothing actuated either by enmity or
favor. Well, do you now think that I acted reasonably in declining
the ministry of this office? But I have not even yet gone through
all my reasons with you; for I have some others still to mention.
And do not grow impatient of listening to a friendly and sincere
man, who wishes to clear himself from your accusations; for these
statements are not only serviceable for the defence which you have
to make on my behalf, but they will also prove of no small help for
the due administration of the office. For it is necessary for one
who is going to enter upon this path of life to investigate all
matters thoroughly well, before he sets his hand to the ministry.
Do you ask why? Because one who knows all things clearly will have
this advantage, if no other, that he will not feel strange when
these things befall him. Would you like me then to approach the
question of superintending widows, first of all, or of the care of
virgins, or the difficulty of the judicial function. For in each of
these cases there is a different kind of anxiety, and the fear is
greater than the anxiety.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.v-p62">Now in the first place, to start from that
subject which seems to be simpler than the others, the charge of
widows appears to cause anxiety to those who take care of them only
so far as the expenditure of money is concerned; but the case is
otherwise, and here also a careful scrutiny is needed, when they
have to be enrolled,<note place="end" n="117" id="iv.v-p62.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.v-p63"> That is, “put upon the Church-roll.” From
apostolic times as we know from 
<scripRef passage="1 Tim. v. 9, 10" id="iv.v-p63.1" parsed="|1Tim|5|9|5|10" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.5.9-1Tim.5.10">1 Tim. v. 9, 10</scripRef>, the Church had recognized the
care of widows as a duty; but one to be exercised with caution,
lest unworthy persons should take advantage of it. In
Chrysostom’s time there was an “order of widows,” which had
departed very much from the primitive simplicity and devotion to
religious works which distinguished the order of earlier days. The
Church strongly encouraged abstinence from a second marriage: and
many women seem to have taken a vow of widowhood, and secured a
place in the Church-roll, only in the hope of throwing a decent
veil over an irreligious, if not immoral life.</p></note> for infinite mischief has been
caused by putting them on the list without due discrimination. For
they have ruined households, and severed marriages, and have often
been detected in thieving and pilfering and unseemly deeds of that
kind. Now that such women should be supported out of the Church’s
revenues provokes punishment from God, and extreme condemnation
among men, and abates the zeal of those who wish to do good. For
who would ever choose to expend the wealth which he was commanded
to give to Christ upon those who defame the name of Christ? For
these reasons a strict and accurate scrutiny ought to be made so as
to prevent the supply of the indigent being wasted, not only by the
women already mentioned, but also by those who are able to provide
for themselves. And this scrutiny is succeeded by no small anxiety
of another kind, to ensure an abundant and unfailing stream of
supply as from a fountain; for compulsory poverty is an insatiable
kind of evil, querulous and ungrateful. And great discretion and
great zeal is required so as to stop the mouths of complainers,
depriving them of every excuse. Now most men, when they see any one
superior to the love of money, forthwith represent him as well
qualified for this stewardship. But I do not think that this
greatness of soul is ever sufficient of itself, although it ought
to be possessed prior to all other qualities; for without this a
man would be a destroyer rather than a protector, a wolf instead of
a shepherd; nevertheless, combined with this, the possession of
another quality also should be demanded. And this quality is
forbearance, the cause of all good things in men, impelling as it
were and conducting the soul into a serene haven. For widows are a
class who, both on account of their poverty, their age and natural
dispo<pb n="56" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_56.html" id="iv.v-Page_56" />sition,
indulge in unlimited freedom of speech (so I had best call it); and
they make an unseasonable clamor and idle complaints and
lamentations about matters for which they ought to be grateful, and
bring accusations concerning things which they ought contentedly to
accept. Now the superintendent should endure all these things in a
generous spirit, and not be provoked either by their unreasonable
annoyance or their unreasonable complaints. For this class of
persons deserve to be pitied for their misfortunes, not to be
insulted; and to trample upon their calamities, and add the pain of
insult to that which poverty brings, would be an act of extreme
brutality. On this account one of the wisest of men, having regard
to the avarice and pride of human nature, and considering the
nature of poverty and its terrible power to depress even the
noblest character, and induce it often to act in these same
respects without shame, in order that a man should not be irritated
when accused, nor be provoked by continual importunity to become an
enemy where he ought to bring aid, he instructs him to be affable
and accessible to the suppliant, saying, “Incline thine ear to a
poor man and give him a friendly answer with meekness.”<note place="end" n="118" id="iv.v-p63.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.v-p64"> <scripRef passage="Ecclesiasticus 4.8" id="iv.v-p64.1" parsed="|Sir|4|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Sir.4.8">Ecclus. iv. 8</scripRef>.</p></note> And passing
by the case of one who succeeds in exasperating (for what can one
say to him who is overcome?), he addresses the man who is able to
bear the other’s infirmity, exhorting him before he bestows his
gift to correct the suppliant by the gentleness of his countenance
and the mildness of his words. But if any one, although he does not
take the property (of these widows), nevertheless loads them with
innumerable reproaches, and insults them, and is exasperated
against them, he not only fails through his gift to alleviate the
despondency produced by poverty, but aggravates the distress by his
abuse. For although they may be compelled to act very shamelessly
through the necessity of hunger, they are nevertheless distressed
at this compulsion. When, then, owing to the dread of famine, they
are constrained to beg, and owing to their begging are constrained
to put off shame, and then again on account of their shamelessness
are insulted, the power of despondency becoming of a complex kind,
and accompanied by much gloom, settles down upon the soul. And one
who has the charge of these persons ought to be so long-suffering,
as not only not to increase their despondency by his fits of anger,
but also to remove the greater part of it by his exhortation. For
as the man who has been insulted, although he is in the enjoyment
of great abundance, does not feel the advantage of his wealth, on
account of the blow which he has received from the insult; so on
the other hand, the man who has been addressed with kindly words,
and for whom the gift has been accompanied with encouragement,
exults and rejoices all the more, and the thing given becomes
doubled in value through the manner in which it is offered. And
this I say not of myself, but borrow from him whose precept I
quoted just now: “My son, blemish not thy good deeds, neither use
uncomfortable words when thou givest anything. Shall not the dew
assuage the heat? So is a word better than a gift. Lo! is not a
word better than a gift? but both are with a gracious man.”<note place="end" n="119" id="iv.v-p64.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.v-p65"> <scripRef passage="Ecclesiasticus 18.15-17" id="iv.v-p65.1" parsed="|Sir|18|15|18|17" osisRef="Bible:Sir.18.15-Sir.18.17">Ecclus. xviii.
15–17</scripRef>.</p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.v-p66">But the superintendent of these persons ought not
only to be gentle and forbearing, but also skillful in the
management of property; for if this qualification is wanting, the
affairs of the poor are again involved in the same distress. One
who was entrusted not long ago with this ministry, and got together
a large hoard of money, neither consumed it himself, nor expended
it with a few exceptions upon those who needed it, but kept the
greater part of it buried in the earth until a season of distress
occurred, when it was all surrendered into the hands of the enemy.
Much forethought, therefore, is needed, that the resources of the
Church should be neither over abundant, nor deficient, but that all
the supplies which are provided should be quickly distributed among
those who require them, and the treasures of the Church stored up
in the hearts of those who are under her rule.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.v-p67">Moreover, in the reception of strangers, and the
care of the sick, consider how great an expenditure of money is
needed, and how much exactness and discernment on the part of those
who preside over these matters. For it is often necessary that this
expenditure should be even larger than that of which I spoke just
now, and that he who presides over it should combine prudence and
wisdom with skill in the art of supply, so as to dispose the
affluent to be emulous and ungrudging in their gifts, lest while
providing for the relief of the sick, he should vex the souls of
those who supply their wants. But earnestness and zeal need to be
displayed here in a far higher degree; for the sick are difficult
creatures to please, and prone to languor; and unless great
accuracy and care are used, even a slight oversight is enough to do
the patient great mischief.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.v-p68">17. But in the care of virgins, the fear is greater
in proportion as the possession is more precious, and this flock is
of a nobler character 
<pb n="57" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_57.html" id="iv.v-Page_57" />than the others. Already, indeed, even into
the band of these holy ones, an infinite number of women have
rushed full of innumerable bad qualities; and in this case our
grief is greater than in the other; for there is just the same
difference between a virgin and a widow going astray, as between a
free-born damsel and her handmaid. With widows, indeed, it has
become a common practice to trifle, and to rail at one another, to
flatter or to be impudent, to appear everywhere in public, and to
perambulate the market-place. But the virgin has striven for nobler
aims, and eagerly sought the highest kind of philosophy,<note place="end" n="120" id="iv.v-p68.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.v-p69"> <i>i.e</i>., a life of religious contemplation,
not, however, as a member of a monastic community, for Chrysostom,
throughout this section, appears to be speaking of the canonical or
ecclesiastical virgins who were consecrated to a religious life,
yet remained at home under the care of their parents (if living) or
of the Church. The first notices of separate houses for women who
had taken the vow of virginity occur in the middle of the 4th
century. St. Ambrose mentions one at Bologna. De Virg. i. 10. St.
Basil is said to have founded some (see St. Greg. Naz. Orat.
47).</p></note> and
professes to exhibit upon earth the life which angels lead, and
while yet in the flesh proposes to do deeds which belong to the
incorporeal powers. Moreover, she ought not to make numerous or
unnecessary journeys, neither is it permissible for her to utter
idle and random words; and as for abuse and flattery, she should
not even know them by name. On this account she needs the most
careful guardianship, and the greater assistance. For the enemy of
holiness is always surprising and lying in wait for these persons,
ready to devour any one of them if she should slip and fall; many
men also there are who lay snares for them; and besides all these
things there is the passionateness of their own human nature, so
that, speaking generally, the virgin has to equip herself for a
twofold war, one which attacks her from without, and the other
which presses upon her from within. For these reasons he who has
the superintendence of virgins suffers great alarm, and the danger
and distress is yet greater, should any of the things which are
contrary to his wishes occur, which God forbid. For if a daughter
kept in seclusion is a cause of sleeplessness to her father, his
anxiety about her depriving him of sleep, where the fear is so
great lest she should be childless, or pass the flower of her age
(unmarried), or be hated (by her husband),<note place="end" n="121" id="iv.v-p69.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.v-p70"> <scripRef passage="Ecclesiasticus 42.9" id="iv.v-p70.1" parsed="|Sir|42|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Sir.42.9">Ecclus. xlii. 9</scripRef>.</p></note> what will he suffer whose anxiety
is not concerned with any of these things, but others far greater?
For in this case it is not a man who is rejected, but Christ
Himself, nor is this barrenness the subject merely of reproach, but
the evil ends in the destruction of the soul; “for every tree,”
it is said, “which bringeth not forth good fruit, is hewn down
and cast into the fire.”<note place="end" n="122" id="iv.v-p70.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.v-p71"> <scripRef passage="Matt. iii. 10" id="iv.v-p71.1" parsed="|Matt|3|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.3.10">Matt. iii.
10</scripRef>.</p></note> And for one who has been repudiated
by the divine Bridegroom, it is not sufficient to receive a
certificate of divorce and so to depart, but she has to pay the
penalty of everlasting punishment. Moreover, a father according to
the flesh has many things which make the custody of his daughter
easy; for the mother, and nurse, and a multitude of handmaids share
in helping the parent to keep the maiden safe. For neither is she
permitted to be perpetually hurrying into the market-place, nor
when she does go there is she compelled to show herself to any of
the passers-by, the evening darkness concealing one who does not
wish to be seen no less than the walls of the house. And apart from
these things, she is relieved from every cause which might
otherwise compel her to meet the gaze of men; for no anxiety about
the necessaries of life, no menaces of oppressors, nor anything of
that kind reduces her to this unfortunate necessity, her father
acting in her stead in all these matters; while she herself has
only one anxiety, which is to avoid doing or saying anything
unworthy the modest conduct which becomes her. But in the other
case there are many things which make the custody of the virgin
difficult, or rather impossible for the father; for he could not
have her in his house with himself, as dwelling together in that
way would be neither seemly nor safe. For even if they themselves
should suffer no loss, but continue to preserve their innocence
unsullied, they would have to give an account for the souls which
they have offended, just as much as if they happened to sin with
one another. And it being impossible for them to live together, it
is not easy to understand the movements of the character, and to
suppress the impulses which are ill regulated, or train and improve
those which are better ordered and tuned. Nor is it an easy thing
to interfere in her habits of walking out; for her poverty and want
of a guardian does not permit him to become an exact investigator
of the propriety of her conduct. For as she is compelled to manage
all her affairs she has many pretexts for going out, if at least
she is not inclined to be self-controlled. Now he who commands her
to stay always at home ought to cut off these pretexts, providing
for her independence in the necessaries of life, and giving her
some woman who will see to the management of these things. He must
also keep her away from funeral obsequies, and nocturnal festivals;
for that artful serpent knows only too well how to scatter his
poison through the medium even of good deeds. And the maiden must
be fenced on every side, and rarely go out of the house during the
whole year, except when she is constrained by inexorable necessity.
Now if any one should say 
<pb n="58" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_58.html" id="iv.v-Page_58" />that none of these things is the proper work of a
bishop to take in hand, let him be assured that the anxieties and
the reasons concerning what takes place in every case have to be
referred to him. And it is far more expedient that he should manage
everything, and so be delivered from the complaints which he must
otherwise undergo on account of the faults of others, than that he
should abstain from the management, and then have to dread being
called to account for things which other men have done. Moreover,
he who does these things by himself, gets through them all with
great ease; but he who is compelled to do it by converting every
one’s opinion does not get relief by being saved from working
single-handed, equivalent to the trouble and turmoil which he
experiences through those who oppose him and combat his decisions.
However, I could not enumerate all the anxieties concerned with the
care of virgins; for when they have to be entered on the list, they
occasion no small trouble to him who is entrusted with this
business.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.v-p72">Again, the judicial department of the bishop’s
office involves innumerable vexations, great consumption of time,
and difficulties exceeding those experienced by men who sit to
judge secular affairs; for it is a labor to discover exact justice,
and when it is found, it is difficult to avoid destroying it. And
not only loss of time and difficulty are incurred, but also no
small danger. For ere now, some of the weaker brethren having
plunged into business, because they have not obtained patronage
have made shipwreck concerning the faith. For many of those who
have suffered wrong, no less than those who have inflicted wrong,
hate those who do not assist them, and they will not take into
account either the intricacy of the matters in question, or the
difficulty of the times, or the limits of sacerdotal authority, or
anything of that kind; but they are merciless judges, recognizing
only one kind of defence—release from the evils which oppress
them. And he who is unable to furnish this, although he may allege
innumerable excuses, will never escape their condemnation.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.v-p73">And talking of patronage, let me disclose another
pretext for fault-finding. For if the bishop does not pay a round
of visits every day, more even than the idle men about town,
unspeakable offence ensues. For not only the sick, but also the
whole, desire to be looked after, not that piety prompts them to
this, but rather that in most cases they pretend claims to honor
and distinction. And if he should ever happen to visit more
constantly one of the richer and more powerful men, under the
pressure of some necessity, with a view to the common benefit of
the Church, he is immediately stigmatized with a character for
fawning and flattery. But why do I speak of patronage and visiting?
For merely from their mode of accosting persons, bishops have to
endure such a load of reproaches as to be often oppressed and
overwhelmed by despondency; in fact, they have also to undergo a
scrutiny of the way in which they use their eyes. For the public
rigorously criticize their simplest actions, taking note of the
tone of their voice, the cast of their countenance, and the degree
of their laughter. He laughed heartily to such a man, one will say,
and accosted him with a beaming face, and a clear voice, whereas to
me he addressed only a slight and passing remark. And in a large
assembly, if he does not turn his eyes in every direction when he
is conversing, the majority declare that his conduct is
insulting.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.v-p74">Who, then, unless he is exceedingly strong, could
cope with so many accusers, so as either to avoid being indited
altogether, or, if he is indited, to escape? For he must either be
without any accusers, or, if this is impossible, purge himself of
the accusations which are brought against him; and if this again is
not an easy matter, as some men delight in making vain and wanton
charges, he must make a brave stand against the dejection produced
by these complaints. He, indeed, who is justly accused, may easily
tolerate the accuser, for there is no bitterer accuser than
conscience; wherefore, if we are caught first by this most terrible
adversary, we can readily endure the milder ones who are external
to us. But he who has no evil thing upon his conscience, when he is
subjected to an empty charge, is speedily excited to wrath, and
easily sinks into dejection, unless he happens to have practised
beforehand how to put up with the follies of the multitude. For it
is utterly impossible for one who is falsely accused without cause,
and condemned, to avoid feeling some vexation and annoyance at such
great injustice.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.v-p75">And how can one speak of the distress which
bishops undergo, whenever it is necessary to cut some one off from
the full communion of the Church? Would indeed that the evil went
no further than distress! but in fact the mischief is not trifling.
For there is a fear lest the man, if he has been punished beyond
what he deserves, should experience that which was spoken of by the
blessed Paul and “be swallowed up by overmuch sorrow.”<note place="end" n="123" id="iv.v-p75.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.v-p76"> <scripRef passage="2 Cor. ii. 7" id="iv.v-p76.1" parsed="|2Cor|2|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.2.7">2 Cor. ii.

accuracy, therefore, is required in this matter also, lest what is
intended to be 
<pb n="59" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_59.html" id="iv.v-Page_59" />profitable should become to him an occasion
of greater damage. For whatever sins he may commit after such a
method of treatment, the wrath caused by each of them must be
shared by the physician who so unskillfully applied his knife to
the wound. What severe punishment, then, must be expected by one
who has not only to render an account of the offences which he
himself has separately committed, but also incurs extreme danger on
account of the sins committed by others? For if we shudder at
undergoing judgment for our own misdeeds, believing that we shall
not be able to escape the fire of the other world, what must one
expect to suffer who has to answer for so many others? To prove the
truth of this, listen to the blessed Paul, or rather not to him,
but to Christ speaking in him, when he says: “Obey them that have
the rule over you, and submit, for they watch for your souls as
they that shall give account.”<note place="end" n="124" id="iv.v-p76.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.v-p77"> <scripRef passage="Hebrews xiii. 17" id="iv.v-p77.1" parsed="|Heb|13|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Heb.13.17">Hebrews

slight? It is impossible to say: but these considerations are
sufficient to convince even the most incredulous and obdurate that
I did not make this escape under the influence of pride or
vainglory, but merely out of fear for my own safety, and
consideration of the gravity of the office.</p>

hurriedly seized upon the ministry, and whoever willingly and
deliberately enters upon it, can no longer say, “I have sinned in
this matter against my will—and against my will I have ruined
such and such a soul;” for He who will one day judge him, will
say to him, “Since then thou wert conscious of such inexperience,
and hadst not ability for undertaking this matter without incurring
reproach, why wert thou so eager and presumptuous as to take in
hand what was so far beyond thy power? Who compelled thee to do so?
Didst thou shrink or fly, and did any one drag thee on by force?”
But thou wilt hear nothing like this, for thou canst have nothing
of this kind to condemn thyself for; and it is evident to all that
thou wert in no degree ambitious of this dignity, for the
accomplishment of the matter was due to the action of others.

thou sayest; no, by no means. And if thou wilt, I will give thee a
proof of what I maintain, from the case of a kingdom, which is not
of such account with God as the priesthood. Saul, that son of Kish,
was not himself at all ambitious of becoming a king, but was going
in quest of his asses, and came to ask the prophet about them. The
prophet, however, proceeded to speak to him of the kingdom, but not
even then did he run greedily after it, though he heard about it
from a prophet, but drew back and deprecated it, saying, “Who am
I, and what is my father’s house.”<note place="end" n="129" id="iv.vi-p9.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi-p10"> <scripRef passage="1 Sam. ix. 21" id="iv.vi-p10.1" parsed="|1Sam|9|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Sam.9.21">1 Sam. ix.

of the honor which had been given him by God, were those words of
his able to rescue him from the wrath of Him who had made him king?
And was he able to say to Samuel, when rebuked by him: “Did I
greedily run and rush after the kingdom and sovereign power? I
wished to lead the undisturbed and peaceful life of ordinary men,
but <i>thou</i> didst drag me to this post of honor. Had I remained
in my low estate I should easily have escaped all these stumbling
blocks, for were I one of the obscure multitude, I should never
have been sent forth on this expedition, nor would God have
committed to my hands the war against the Amalekites, and if I had
not had it committed to me, I should not have sinned this sin.”
But all such arguments are weak as excuses, and not only weak, but
perilous, inasmuch as they rather kindle the wrath of God. For he
who has been promoted to great honor by God, must not advance the
greatness of his honor as an excuse for his errors, but should make
God’s special favor towards him the motive for further
improvement; whereas he who thinks himself at liberty to sin
because he has obtained some uncommon dignity, what does he but
study to show that the lovingkindness of God is the cause of his
personal transgression, which is always the argument of those who
lead godless and careless lives. But <i>we</i> ought to be on no
account thus minded, nor to fall away into the insane folly of such
people, but be ambitious at all times to make the most of such
powers as we have, and to be reverent both in speech and
thought.</p>

are due to human ambition. God chose Judas, and counted him one of

For we must not use the high honors given to us by God so as to
offend Him, but so as to please Him better. But he who claims
exemption from punishment where it is due, because he has been
exalted to higher honor than others, acts very much like one of
those unbelieving Jews, who after hearing Christ say, “If I had
not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin,” “If I had
not done among them the works which none other did, they had not
had sin,”<note place="end" n="140" id="iv.vi-p21.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi-p22"> <scripRef passage="John xv. 22-24" id="iv.vi-p22.1" parsed="|John|15|22|15|24" osisRef="Bible:John.15.22-John.15.24">John xv.

reproach the Saviour and benefactor of mankind by replying, “Why,
then, didst thou come and speak? why didst thou work miracles? was
it that thou mightest punish us the more?” But these are the
words of madness and of utter senselessness. For the Great
Physician came not to give thee over, but to heal thee—not to
pass thee by when thou wert sick, but to rid thee entirely of
disease. But thou hast of thine own accord withdrawn thyself from
his hands; receive therefore the sorer punishment. For as thou
wouldest have been freed from thy former maladies if thou hadst
yielded to his treatment, so if, when thou sawest him coming to
thine aid thou fleddest from him, thou wilt no longer be able to
cleanse thyself of these infirmities, and as thou art unable, thou
wilt both suffer punishment for them, and also because for thy part
thou madest God’s solicitude for thy good of none effect.
Therefore we who act like this are not subjected to the same
torment after as before we received honor at God’s hands, but far
severer torment after than before. For he who has not become good
even by being well treated, deserves all the bitterer punishment.
Since, then, this excuse of thine has been shown to be weak, and
not only fails to save those who take refuge in it, but exposes
them so much the more, we must provide ourselves with some other
means of safety.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.vi-p23"><span class="c12" id="iv.vi-p23.1">Basil</span>: Tell me of what
nature is that? since, as for me, I am at present scarce master of
myself, thou hast reduced me to such a state of fear and trembling
by what thou hast said.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.vi-p24"><span class="c12" id="iv.vi-p24.1">Chrysostom</span>: Do not, I
beseech and implore thee, do not be so downcast. For while there is
safety for us who are weak, namely, in not undertaking this office
at all, there is safety for you too who are strong, and this
consists in making your hopes of salvation depend, next to the
grace of God, on avoiding every act unworthy of this gift, and of
God who gave it. For they certainly would be deserving of the
greatest punishment who, after obtaining this dignity through their
own ambition, should then either on account of sloth, or
wickedness, or even inexperience, abuse the office. Not that we are
to gather from this that there is pardon in store for those who
have not been thus ambitious. Yea, even they too are deprived of
all excuse. For in my judgment, if ten thousand were to entreat and
urge, a man should pay them no attention, but should first of all
search his own heart, and examine the whole matter carefully before
yielding to their importunities. Now no one would venture to
undertake the building of a house were he not an architect, nor
will any one attempt the cure of sick bodies who is not a skilled
physician; but even though many urge him, will beg off, and will
not be ashamed to own his ignorance; and shall he who is going to
have the care of so many souls entrusted to him, not examine
himself beforehand? will he accept this ministry even though he be
the most inexperienced of men, because this one commands him, or
that man constrains him, or for fear of offending a third? And if
so, how will he escape casting himself together with them into
manifest misery. Had he continued as he was, it were possible for
him to be saved, but now he involves others in his own destruction.
For whence can he hope for salvation? whence 
<pb n="63" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_63.html" id="iv.vi-Page_63" />to obtain pardon? Who will then
successfully intercede for us? they who are now perhaps urging us
and forcibly dragging us on? But who will save these same at such a
moment? For even they too will stand in need in their turn of
intercession, that they may escape the fire. Now, that I say not
these things to frighten thee, but as representing the matter as in
truth it is, hear what the holy Apostle Paul saith to Timothy his
disciple, his own and beloved son, “Lay hands suddenly on no man,
neither be partaker of other men’s sins.”<note place="end" n="141" id="iv.vi-p24.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi-p25"> <scripRef passage="1 Tim. v. 22" id="iv.vi-p25.1" parsed="|1Tim|5|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.5.22">1 Tim. v.

blame, yea and vengeance, we, so far as in us lies, have delivered
those who were ready to put us forward for this office.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.vi-p26">2. For as it is not enough for those who are chosen
to say in excuse for themselves, “I did not summon myself to this
office, nor could I avoid what I did not see beforehand;” so
neither will it be a sufficient plea for those who ordain them to
say that they did not know him who was ordained. The charge against
them becomes greater on account of their ignorance of him whom they
brought forward, and what seems to excuse them only serves to
accuse them the more. For how absurd a thing, is it not? that they
who want to buy a slave, show him to the physician, and require
sureties for the sale, and information about him from their
neighbours, and after all this do not yet venture on his purchase
without asking for some time for a trial of him; while they who are
going to admit any one to so great an office as this, give their
testimonial and their sanction loosely and carelessly, without
further investigation, just because some one wishes it, or to court
the favor, or to avoid the displeasure of some one else. Who shall
then successfully intercede for us in that day, when they who ought
to defend us stand themselves in need of defenders? He who is going
to ordain, therefore, ought to make diligent inquiry, and much more
he who is to be ordained. For though they who ordain him share his
punishment, for any sins which he may commit in his office, yet so
far from escaping vengeance he will even pay a greater penalty than
they—save only if they who chose him acted from some worldly
motive contrary to what seemed justifiable to themselves. For if
they should be detected so doing, and knowing a man to be unworthy
have brought him forward on some pretext or other, the amount of
their punishment shall be equivalent to his, nay perhaps the
punishment shall be even greater for them who appointed the unfit
man. For he who gives authority to any one who is minded to destroy
the Church, would be certainly to blame for the outrages which that
person commits. But if he is guilty of no such thing, and says that
he has been misled by the opinions of others, even then he shall
not altogether remain unpunished, but his punishment shall be a
little lighter than his who has been ordained. What then? It is
possible that they who elect may come to the election deceived by a
false report. But he who is elected could not say, “I am ignorant
of myself,” as others were of him. As one who will receive
therefore a sorer punishment than they who put him forward, so
should he make his scrutiny of himself more careful than that which
they make of him; and if they in ignorance drag him on, he ought to
come forward and instruct them carefully about any matters whereby
he may stop their being misled; and so having shown himself
unworthy of trial may escape the burden of so high an office.</p>

departments of this life, when some plan is proposed, the
husbandman will not undertake to navigate the ship, nor the soldier
to till the ground, nor the pilot to lead an army, under pain of
ten thousand deaths? Is it not plainly this? that each foresees the
danger which would attend his incompetence? Well, where the loss is
concerned with trifles shall we use so much forethought, and refuse
to yield to the pressure of compulsion, but where the punishment is
eternal, as it is for those who know not how to handle the
Priesthood, shall we want only and inconsiderately run into so
great danger, and then advance, as our excuse, the pressing
entreaties of others? But He who one day will judge us will
entertain no such plea as this. For we ought to show far more
caution in spiritual matters than in carnal. But now we are not
found exhibiting as much caution. For tell me: if supposing a man
to be an artificer, when he is not so, we invited him to do a piece
of work, and he were to respond to the call, and then having set
his hand to the material prepared for the building, were to spoil
the wood and spoil the stone, and so to build the house that it
straightway fell to pieces, would it be sufficient excuse for him
to allege that he had been urged by others and did not come of his
own accord? in no wise; and very reasonably and justly so. For he
ought to have refused even at the call of others. So for the man
who only spoils wood and stone, there will be no escape from paying
the penalty, and is he who de<pb n="64" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_64.html" id="iv.vi-Page_64" />stroys souls, and builds the
temple of God carelessly, to think that the compulsion of others is
his warrant for escaping punishment? Is not this very absurd? For I
omit the fact as yet that no one is able to compel the man who is
unwilling. But be it that he was subjected to excessive pressure
and divers artful devices, and then fell into a snare; will this
therefore rescue him from punishment? I beseech thee, let us not
deceive ourselves, and pretend that we know not what is obvious to
a mere child. For surely this pretence of ignorance will not be
able to profit in the day of reckoning. Thou wert not ambitious,
thou sayest, of receiving this high office, conscious of thine own
weakness. Well and good. Then thou oughtest, with the same mind, to
have declined the solicitation of others; or, when no one called
thee, wast thou weak and incapable, but when those were found ready
to offer thee this dignity, didst thou suddenly become competent?

exercise, and a thousand other rules (for the omission of the
merest trifle upsets and spoils the whole), how shall they to whose
lot falls the care of the body, which has its conflict not against
flesh and blood, but against powers unseen, be able to keep it
sound and healthy, unless they far surpass ordinary human virtue,
and are versed in all healing proper for the soul?</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.vi-p36">3. Pray, art thou not aware that that body is
subject to more diseases and assaults than this flesh of ours, is
more quickly corrupted, and more slow to recover? and by those who
have the healing of these bodies, divers medicines have been
discovered, and an apparatus of different instruments, and diet
suitable for the sick; and often the condition of the atmosphere is
of itself enough for the recovery of a sick man; and there are
instances of seasonable sleep having saved the physician all
further labor. But in the case before us, it is impossible to take
any of these things into consideration; nay there is but one method
and way of healing appointed, after we have gone wrong, and that
is, the powerful application of the Word. This is the one
instrument, the only diet, the finest atmosphere. This takes the
place of physic, cautery and cutting, and if it be needful to sear
and amputate, this is the means which we must use, and if this be
of no avail, all else is wasted; with this we both rouse the soul
when it sleeps, and reduce it when it is inflamed; with this we cut
off excesses, and fill up defects, and perform all manner of other
operations which are requisite for the soul’s health. Now as
regards the ordering of our daily life for the best, it is true
that the life of another may provoke us to emulation. But in the
matter of spurious doctrine, when any soul is diseased thereby,
then there is great need of the Word, not only in view of the
safety of our own people, but in view of the enemy without. If,
indeed, one had the sword of the spirit, and the shield of faith,<note place="end" n="149" id="iv.vi-p36.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi-p37"> <scripRef passage="Eph. vi. 16, 17" id="iv.vi-p37.1" parsed="|Eph|6|16|6|17" osisRef="Bible:Eph.6.16-Eph.6.17">Eph. vi.

able to work miracles, and by means of these marvels to stop the
mouths of impudent gainsayers, one would have little need of the

themselves might have leisure “for the ministry of the Word.”<note place="end" n="151" id="iv.vi-p38.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi-p39"> <scripRef passage="Acts vi. 4" id="iv.vi-p39.1" parsed="|Acts|6|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.6.4">Acts vi.

ought equally to apply ourselves, unless indeed we are endued with
a power of working miracles. But if there is not the least sign of
such a power being left us, while on every side many enemies are
constantly attacking us, why then it necessarily follows that we
should arm ourselves with this weapon, both in order that we may
not be wounded ourselves with the darts of the enemy, and in order
that we may wound him.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.vi-p40">4. Wherefore it should be our ambition that

battle only that we have to be prepared. This warfare is manifold,
and is engaged with a great variety of enemies; neither do all
these use the same weapons, nor do they practice the same method of
attack; and he who has to join battle with all, must needs know the
artifices of all, and be at once both archer and slinger, captain
and general, in the ranks and in command, on foot and on horseback,
in sea-fight and in siege. In common warfare, indeed, each man
repels the enemy by discharging the particular duty which he has
undertaken. But here it is otherwise; and if any one wishes to come
off conqueror in this warfare, he must understand all forms of the
art, as the devil knows well how to introduce his own assailants
through any one spot which may happen to be unguarded, and to carry
off the sheep. But not so where he perceives the shepherd coming
equipped with accurate knowledge at all points, and well acquainted
with his plottings. Wherefore we ought to be well-guarded in all
parts: for a city, so long as it happens to be surrounded with a
wall, laughs to scorn the besiegers, abiding in great security; but
if any one makes a breach in the wall, though but of the size of a
gate, the rest of the circuit is of no use, although the whole of
it stand quite securely; so it is with the city of God: so long as
the presence of mind and wisdom of the shepherd, which answers to
the wall, protect it on all sides, all the enemy’s devices end in
his confusion and ridicule, and they who dwell within the wall
abide unmolested, but wherever any one has been able to demolish a
single part, though the rest stand never so fast, through that
breach ruin will enter upon the whole. For to what purpose does a
man contend earnestly with the Greeks, if at the same time he
becomes a prey to the Jews? or get the better of both these and
then fall into the clutches of the Manichæans?<note place="end" n="153" id="iv.vi-p41.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi-p42"> The followers of Manes, or Manichæus, who was born
about 240 A.D. He taught that God was the cause of good, and matter
the cause of evil. This theory about matter led him to hold that
the body of Jesus was an incorporeal phantom. He eliminated the Old
Testament from the Scriptures, and held himself at liberty also to
reject such passages in the New Testament as were opposed to his
own opinions. See Robertson: Hist. of the Christian Church, vol. i.
139–145.</p></note> or after he has proved himself
superior to them even, if they who introduce fatalism<note place="end" n="154" id="iv.vi-p42.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi-p43"> “<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.vi-p43.1">οἱ την

and make havoc of the flock? But not to enumerate all the heresies
of the devil, it will be enough to say that unless the shepherd is
well skilled in refuting them all, the wolf, by means of any one of
them, can enter, and devour the greater part of the flock. In
ordinary warfare we must always look for victory being won or
defeat sustained by the soldiers who are on the field of battle.
But in the spiritual warfare the case is quite different. For there
it often happens that the combat with one set of enemies secures a
victory for others who never engaged in battle at all, nor took any
trouble, but were sitting still all the while; and he who has not
much experience in such occurrences will get pierced, so to say,
with his own sword, and become the laughing-stock of friends and
foes alike. I will try by an example to make clear what I am
saying. They who receive the wild doctrines of Valentinus and
Marcion,<note place="end" n="155" id="iv.vi-p43.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi-p44"> Marcion and Valentinus (A.D. 140) were each
founders of a form of Gnosticism. Each held that the God of the Old
Testament was morally contrary to the God of the New: while the
system of Valentinus represented the imaginative and speculative
side of Gnosticism, that of Marcion represented its practical side,
and was rather religious than theological. The sect of the
Valentinians lasted as late as the 5th century; and Marcionism was
not extinct till the 6th.</p></note> and of all
whose minds are similarly diseased, exclude the Law given by God to
Moses from the catalogue of the Divine Scriptures. But Jews so
revere the Law, that although the time has come which annuls it,
they still contend for the observance of all its contents, contrary
to the purpose of God. But the Church of God, avoiding either
extreme, has trodden a middle path, and is neither induced on the
one hand to place herself under its yoke, nor on the other does she
tolerate its being slandered, but commends it, though its day is
over, because of its profitableness while its season lasted. Now it
is necessary for him who is going to fight with both these
enemies,<note place="end" n="156" id="iv.vi-p44.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi-p45"> Sc. Jews and Marcionites.</p></note> to be fully
conversant with this middle course. For if in wishing to teach the
Jews that they are out of date in clinging to the old law, he
begins to find fault with it unsparingly, he gives no little handle
to those heretics who wish to pull it to pieces; and if in his
ambition to stop their mouths he extols it immoderately, and speaks
of it with admiration, as 
<pb n="66" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_66.html" id="iv.vi-Page_66" />necessary for this present time, he unseals
the lips of the Jews. Again they who labor under the frenzy of
Sabellius and the craze of Arius,<note place="end" n="157" id="iv.vi-p45.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi-p46"> Sabellius was condemned in a Council held in Rome,
A.D. 263, for holding that there is but one person in the Godhead,
and that the Word and Holy Spirit are only virtues or emanations of
the Deity. Arius held that our Lord Jesus Christ existed before His
Incarnation, that by Him as by an instrument the Supreme God made
the worlds, and that as being the most ancient and the highest of
created beings, He is to be worshipped; but that He had a beginning
of existence, and so is not God’s co-eternally begotten Son, nor
of the very substance of the Supreme God. See Liddon, Bampton
Lectures, i. p. 25. The heresy of Arius was condemned at the
Council of Nicæa, A.D. 325.</p></note> have both fallen from a sound faith
for want of observing a middle course. The name of Christian is
applied to both these heretics; but if any one examines their
doctrines, he will find the one sect not much better than the Jews,
and differing from them only in name, and the other<note place="end" n="158" id="iv.vi-p46.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi-p47"> Sc. The Arians.</p></note> very nearly
holding the heresy of Paul of Samosata,<note place="end" n="159" id="iv.vi-p47.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi-p48"> Paul of Samosata was appointed Bishop of Antioch
about 260 A.D. The Humanitarian movement culminated in his
teaching, which maintained that the Word was only in the Father, as
reason is in man; that Jesus was a mere man, and that he is called
Son of God as having, in a certain sense, become such through the
influence of the Divine Word which dwelt in him, but without any
personal union.</p></note> and that both are very wide of the
truth. Great, therefore, is the danger in such cases, and the way
of orthodoxy is narrow and hemmed in by threatening crags on either
side, and there is no little fear lest when intending to strike at
one enemy we should be wounded by the other. For if any one assert
the unity of the Godhead, Sabellius straightway turns that
expression to the advantage of his own mental vagary,<note place="end" n="160" id="iv.vi-p48.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi-p49"> <i>i.e</i>., while he maintained the Unity of the
Godhead against the Arians there was danger of slipping into the
Sabellian error of “confounding the Persons.”</p></note> and if he
distinguish the Persons, and say that the Father is one, and the
Son another, and the Holy Spirit a third, up gets Arius, ready to
wrest that distinction of Persons into a difference of substance;<note place="end" n="161" id="iv.vi-p49.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi-p50"> <i>i.e</i>., while he divided the Persons against
the Sabellians he had to guard against the Arian error of
“dividing the substance” also.</p></note> so we must
turn and flee both from the impious confounding of the Persons by
the one, and the senseless division of the substance by the other,
confessing, indeed, that the Godhead of the Father and of the Son
and of the Holy Ghost, is all one, while we add thereunto a Trinity
of Persons. For then we shall be able to fortify ourselves against
the attacks of both heretics. I might tell thee besides these, of
several other adversaries against which, except we contend bravely
and carefully, we shall leave the field covered with
wounds.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.vi-p51">5. Why should any one describe the silly
chatter of our own people? For these are not less than the attacks
upon us from without, while they give the teacher even more
trouble. Some out of an idle curiosity are rashly bent upon busying
themselves about matters which are neither possible for them to
know, nor of any advantage to them if they could know them. Others
again demand from God an account of his judgments, and force
themselves to sound the depth of that abyss which is unfathomable.
“For thy judgments,” saith the Scriptures, “are a great
deep,”<note place="end" n="162" id="iv.vi-p51.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi-p52"> <scripRef passage="Ps. xxxvi. 6" id="iv.vi-p52.1" parsed="|Ps|36|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.36.6">Ps. xxxvi.
6</scripRef>.</p></note> and about
their faith and practice thou wouldest find few of them anxious,
but the majority curiously inquiring into matters which it is not
possible to discover, and the mere inquiry into which provokes God.
For when we make a determined effort to learn what <i>He</i> does
not wish us to know, we fail to succeed (for how should we succeed
against the will of God?); and there only remains for us the danger
arising from our inquiry. Now, though this be the case, whenever
any one authoritatively stops the search, into such fathomless
depths, he gets himself the reputation of being proud and ignorant;
so that at such times much tact is needed on the Bishop’s part,
so as to lead his people away from these unprofitable questions,
and himself escape the above-named censures. In short, to meet all
these difficulties, there is no help given but that of speech, and
if any be destitute of this power, the souls of those who are put
under his charge (I mean of the weaker and more meddlesome kind)
are no better off than ships continually storm-tossed. So that the
Priest should do all that in him lies, to gain this means of
strength.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.vi-p53">6. <span class="c12" id="iv.vi-p53.1">Basil</span>: “Why,
then, was not St. Paul ambitious of becoming perfect in this art?
He makes no secret of his poverty of speech, but distinctly
confesses himself to be unskilled, even telling the Corinthians
so,<note place="end" n="163" id="iv.vi-p53.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi-p54"> <scripRef passage="2 Cor. xi. 6" id="iv.vi-p54.1" parsed="|2Cor|11|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.11.6">2 Cor. xi.

admired for their eloquence, and prided themselves upon
it.”</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.vi-p55"><span class="c12" id="iv.vi-p55.1">Chrysostom</span>: This is the
very thing which has ruined many and made them remiss in the study
of true doctrine. For while they failed to fathom the depths of the
apostle’s mind, and to understand the meaning of his words, they
passed all their time slumbering and yawning, and paying respect
not to that ignorance which St. Paul acknowledges, but to a kind
from which he was as free as any man ever was in the world.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.vi-p56">But leaving this subject to await our consideration,
I say this much in the meantime. Granting that St. Paul was in this
respect as unskilled as they would have him to be, what has that to
do with the men of to-day? For he had a greater power by far than
power of speech, power which brought about greater results too;
which was that his bare presence, even though he was silent, was
terrible to the <pb n="67" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_67.html" id="iv.vi-Page_67" />demons.
But the men of the present day, if they were all collected in one
place, would not be able, with infinite prayers and tears, to do
the wonders that once were done by the handkerchief of St. Paul. He
too by his prayers raised the dead,<note place="end" n="164" id="iv.vi-p56.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi-p57"> <scripRef passage="Acts xx. 10" id="iv.vi-p57.1" parsed="|Acts|20|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.20.10">Acts xx.

that he was held to be a god by heathen;<note place="end" n="165" id="iv.vi-p57.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi-p58"> <scripRef passage="Acts xiv. 11" id="iv.vi-p58.1" parsed="|Acts|14|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.14.11">Acts xiv.
11</scripRef>.</p></note> and before he was removed from this
life, he was thought worthy to be caught up as far as the third
heaven, and to share in such converse as it is not lawful for
mortal ears to hear.<note place="end" n="166" id="iv.vi-p58.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi-p59"> <scripRef passage="2 Cor. xii. 2-4" id="iv.vi-p59.1" parsed="|2Cor|12|2|12|4" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.12.2-2Cor.12.4">2 Cor.
xii. 2–4</scripRef>.</p></note> But the men of to-day—not that I
would say anything harsh or severe, for indeed I do not speak by
way of insult to them, but only in wonder—how is it that they do
not shudder when they measure themselves with so great a man as
this? For if we leave the miracles and turn to the life of this
blessed saint, and look into his angelic conversation, it is in
this rather than in his miracles that thou wilt find this Christian
athlete a conqueror. For how can one describe his zeal and
forbearance, his constant perils, his continual cares, and
incessant anxiety for the Churches; his sympathy with the weak, his
many afflictions, his unwonted persecutions, his deaths daily?
Where is the spot in the world, where is the continent or sea, that
is a stranger to the labours of this righteous man? Even the desert
has known his presence, for it often sheltered him in time of
danger. For he underwent every species of attack, and achieved
every kind of victory, and there was never any end to his contests
and his triumphs.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.vi-p60">Yet, all unawares, I have been led to do this
man an injury. For his exploits are beyond all powers of
description, and beyond mine in particular, just as the masters of
eloquence surpass me. Nevertheless, since that holy apostle will
judge us, not by the issue, but by the motive, I shall not forbear
till I have stated one more circumstance which surpasses anything
yet mentioned, as much as he himself surpasses all his fellow men.
And what is this? After so many exploits, after such a multitude of
victories, he prayed that he might go into hell, and be handed over
to eternal punishment, if so be that those Jews, who had often
stoned him, and done what they could to make away with him, might
be saved, and come over to Christ.<note place="end" n="167" id="iv.vi-p60.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi-p61"> <scripRef passage="Rom. ix. 3" id="iv.vi-p61.1" parsed="|Rom|9|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.9.3">Rom. ix.
3</scripRef>.</p></note> Now who so longed for Christ? If,
indeed, his feelings towards him ought not to be described as
something nobler than longing; shall we then any more compare
ourselves with this saint, after so great grace was imparted to him
from above, after so great virtue was manifested in himself? What
could be more presumptuous?</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.vi-p62">Now, that he was not so unskilled, as some
count him to be, I shall try to show in what follows. The unskilled
person in men’s estimation is not only one who is unpracticed in
the tricks of profane oratory,<note place="end" n="168" id="iv.vi-p62.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi-p63"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.vi-p63.1">τερθρείαν</span>, from
<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.vi-p63.2">τ™ρθρον</span>, literally, a
sail-rope. The man who condescends to catching the ear by mere
rhetorical artifice being like the mountebank on the trapeze,
fascinating the spectators in a circus by his performances.</p></note> but the man who is incapable of
contending for the defence of the right faith, and they are right.
But St. Paul did not say that he was unskilled in both these
respects, but in one only; and in support of this he makes a
careful distinction, saying that he was “rude in speech, but not
in knowledge.”<note place="end" n="169" id="iv.vi-p63.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi-p64"> <scripRef passage="2 Cor. xi. 6" id="iv.vi-p64.1" parsed="|2Cor|11|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.11.6">2 Cor. xi.
6</scripRef>.</p></note> Now were I
to insist upon the polish of Isocrates, the weight of Demosthenes,
the dignity of Thucydides, and the sublimity of Plato, in any one
bishop, St. Paul would be a strong evidence against me. But I pass
by all such matters and the elaborate ornaments of profane oratory;
and I take no account of style or of delivery; yea let a man’s
diction be poor and his composition simple and unadorned, but let
him not be unskilled in the knowledge and accurate statement of
doctrine; nor in order to screen his own sloth, deprive that holy
apostle of the greatest of his gifts, and the sum of his
praises.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.vi-p65">7. For how was it, tell me, that he confounded
the Jews which dwelt at Damascus,<note place="end" n="170" id="iv.vi-p65.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi-p66"> <scripRef passage="Acts ix. 22" id="iv.vi-p66.1" parsed="|Acts|9|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.9.22">Acts ix.

he sent to Tarsus? Was it not because he was so mighty and
victorious in the word, and brought his adversaries to such a pass
that they, unable to brook their defeat, were provoked to seek his
life? At that time, as I said, he had not begun to work miracles,
nor could any one say that the masses looked upon him with
astonishment on account of any glory belonging to his mighty works,
or that they who contended with him were overpowered by the force
of public opinion concerning him. For at this time he conquered by
dint of argument only. How was it, moreover, that he contended and
disputed successfully with those who tried to Judaize in Antioch?

the lattice, was it not owing to his long attendance even until
midnight to St. Paul’s preaching? How do we find him employed at
Thessalonica and Corinth, in Ephesus and in Rome itself? Did he not
spend whole nights and days in interpreting the Scriptures in their
order? and <pb n="68" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_68.html" id="iv.vi-Page_68" />why
should any one recount his disputes with the Epicureans and

resolved to enter into every particular, our story would grow to an
unreasonable length.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.vi-p71">When, therefore, both before working miracles,

opinion that he and Barnabas were gods indeed, arose out of the

arise from this, but was a consequence of his speech. In what else
did this blessed saint excel the rest of the apostles? and how
comes it that up and down the world he is so much on every one’s
tongue? How comes it that not merely among ourselves, but also
among Jews and Greeks, he is the wonder of wonders? Is it not from
the power of his epistles? whereby not only to the faithful of
to-day, but from his time to this, yea and up to the end, even the
appearing of Christ, he has been and will be profitable, and will
continue to be so as long as the human race shall last. For as a
wall built of adamant, so his writings fortify all the Churches of
the known world, and he as a most noble champion stands in the
midst, bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of
Christ, casting down imaginations, and every high thing which
exalts itself against the knowledge of God,<note place="end" n="176" id="iv.vi-p72.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi-p73"> <scripRef passage="2 Cor. x. 5" id="iv.vi-p73.1" parsed="|2Cor|10|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.10.5">2 Cor. x.

epistles which he has left to us full of wonders and of Divine
wisdom. For his writings are not only useful to us, for the
overthrow of false doctrine and the confirmation of the true, but
they help not a little towards living a good life. For by the use
of these, the bishops of the present day fit and fashion the chaste

her to the state of spiritual beauty; with these, too, they drive
away from her the noisome pestilences which beset her, and preserve
the good health thus obtained. Such are the medicines and such

know them and their power best who constantly use them. From all
this it is evident that St. Paul had given himself to the study of
which we have been speaking with great diligence and

the perfection of teaching when the teachers both by what they do,
and by what they say as well, bring their disciples to that blessed

not enough to instruct others. Nor do I say this of myself; it is
our Saviour’s own word. “For whosoever shall do and teach them,
he shall be called great.<note place="end" n="189" id="iv.vi-p86.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi-p87"> <scripRef passage="Matt. v. 19" id="iv.vi-p87.1" parsed="|Matt|5|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.19">Matt. v.

been enough to have said “whosoever shall <pb n="69" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_69.html" id="iv.vi-Page_69" />do” simply. But now by
distinguishing the two, he shows that practice is one thing, and
doctrine another, and that each needs the help of the others in
order to complete edification. Thou hearest too what the chosen
vessel of Christ says to the Ephesian elders: “Wherefore watch
ye, remembering that for the space of three years, I ceased not to
admonish every one, night and day, with tears.”<note place="end" n="190" id="iv.vi-p87.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi-p88"> <scripRef passage="Acts xx. 31" id="iv.vi-p88.1" parsed="|Acts|20|31|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.20.31">Acts xx.

tears or for admonition by word of mouth, while his life as an

it alone could accomplish everything.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.vi-p89">9. But when a dispute arises concerning matters of
doctrine, and all take their weapons from the same Scriptures, of
what weight will any one’s life be able to prove? What then will
be the good of his many austerities, when after such painful
exercises, any one from the Priest’s great unskillfulness in
argument fall into heresy, and be cut off from the body of the
Church, a misfortune which I have myself seen many suffering. Of
what profit then will his patience be to him? None; no more than
there will be in a sound faith if the life is corrupt. Wherefore,
for this reason more than for all others, it concerns him whose
office it is to teach others, to be experienced in disputations of
this kind. For though he himself stands safely, and is unhurt by
the gainsayers, yet the simple multitude under his direction, when
they see their leader defeated, and without any answer for the
gainsayers, will be apt to lay the blame of his discomfiture not on
his own weakness, but on the doctrines themselves, as though they
were faulty; and so by reason of the inexperience of one, great
numbers are brought to extreme ruin; for though they do not
entirely go over to the adversary, yet they are forced to doubt
about matters in which formerly they firmly believed, and those
whom they used to approach with unswerving confidence, they are
unable to hold to any longer steadfastly, but in consequence of
their leader’s defeat, so great a storm settles down upon their
souls, that the mischief ends in their shipwreck altogether. But
how dire is the destruction, and how terrible the fire which such a
leader brings upon his own wretched head for every soul which is
thus lost, thou wilt not need to learn from me, as thou knowest all
this perfectly. Is this then pride, is this vainglory in me, to be
unwilling to be the cause of the destruction of so many souls? and
of procuring for myself greater punishment in the world to come,
than that which now awaits me there? Who would say so? surely no
one, unless he should wish to find fault where there is none, and
to moralize over other men’s calamities.</p>

<p class="c9" id="iv.vii-p2">1. <span class="c12" id="iv.vii-p2.1">How</span> great is the
skill required for the teacher in contending earnestly for the
truth, has been sufficiently set forth by us. But I have to mention
one more matter beside this, which is a cause of numberless
dangers, though for my own part I should rather say that the thing
itself is not the cause, but they who know not how to use it
rightly, since it is of itself a help to salvation and to much good
besides, whenever thou findest that earnest and good men have the
management of it. What then, do I mean by this? The expenditure of
great labor upon the preparation of discourses to be delivered in
public. For to begin with, the majority of those who are under the
preachers’ charge are not minded to behave towards them as
towards teachers, but disdaining the part of learners, they assume
instead the attitude of those who sit and look on at the public
games; and just as the multitude there is separated into parties,
and some attach themselves to one, and some to another, so here
also men are divided, and become the partisans now of this teacher,
now of that, listening to them with a view to favor or spite. And
not only is there this hardship, but another quite as great. For if
it has occurred to any preacher to weave into his sermons any part
of other men’s works, he is exposed to greater disgrace than
those who steal money. Nay, often where he has not even borrowed
anything from any one, but is only suspected, he has suffered the
fate of a thief. And why do I speak of the works of others when it
is not permitted to him to use his own resources without variety?
For the public are accustomed to listen not for profit, but for
pleasure, sitting like critics of tragedies, and of musical
entertainments, and that facility of speech against which we
declaimed just now, in this case becomes desirable, even more than
in the case of barristers, where they are obliged to contend one
against the other. A preacher then should have loftiness of mind,
far exceeding my own littleness of spirit, that he may correct this
disorderly and unprofitable pleasure on the part of the multitude,
and be able to lead them over to a more useful way of hearing, that
his people may follow and yield to him, and that he may not be led
away by their own humors, and this it is not possible to arrive at,
except by two means: indifference to their praise, and the power of
preaching well.<note place="end" n="191" id="iv.vii-p2.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vii-p3"> Chrysostom’s own sermons were often interrupted
by applause, which he always severely reprimanded.</p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.vii-p4">2. For if either of these be lacking, the remaining
one becomes useless, owing to its divorce from the other, for if a
preacher be indifferent to praise, and yet cannot produce the
doctrine <pb n="71" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_71.html" id="iv.vii-Page_71" />“which is with
grace seasoned with salt,”<note place="end" n="192" id="iv.vii-p4.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vii-p5"> <scripRef passage="Col. iv. 6" id="iv.vii-p5.1" parsed="|Col|4|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Col.4.6">Col. iv.
6</scripRef>.</p></note> he becomes despised by the
multitude, while he gains nothing from his own nobleness of mind;
and if on the other hand he is successful as a preacher, and is
overcome by the thought of applause, harm is equally done in turn,
both to himself and the multitude, because in his desire for praise
he is careful to speak rather with a view to please than to profit.
And as he who neither lets good opinion influence him, nor is
skillful in speaking, does not yield to the pleasure of the
multitude, and is unable to do them any good worth mentioning,
because he has nothing to say, so he who is carried away with
desire for praise, though he is able to render the multitude better
service, rather provides in place of this such food as will suit
their taste, because he purchases thereby the tumult of
acclamation.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.vii-p6">3. The best kind of Bishop must, therefore, be
strong in both these points, so that neither may supplant the
other. For if when he stands up in the congregation and speaks
words calculated to make the careless wince,<note place="end" n="193" id="iv.vii-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vii-p7"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.vii-p7.1">ἐπιστύψαι</span>, literally, to purse up the
mouth, as at the taste of what is tart or sour.</p></note> he then stumbles, and stops short,
and is forced to blush at his failure, the good of what he has
spoken is immediately wasted. For they who are rebuked, being
galled by what has been told them, and unable to avenge themselves
on him otherwise, taunt him, with jeers at this ignorance of his,
thinking to screen their own reproach thereby. Wherefore he ought,
like some very good charioteer, to come to an accurate judgment
about both these good things, in order that he may be able to deal
with both as he may have need; for when he is irreproachable in the
eyes of all, then he will be able, with just so much authority as
he wishes, both to correct and to remit from correction all those
who are under his rule. But without this it will not be easy for
him to do so. But this nobleness of soul should be shown not only
up to the limit of indifference to praise, but should go further in
order that the gain thus gotten may not in its turn be
fruitless.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.vii-p8">4. To what else ought he then to be
indifferent? Slander and envy. Unseasonable evil speaking,<note place="end" n="194" id="iv.vii-p8.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vii-p9"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.vii-p9.1">κακηγορία</span>—if
<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.vii-p9.2">κατηγορία</span> be read,
“accusation” will be the meaning.</p></note> however (for
of course the Bishop undergoes some groundless censure), it is well
that he should neither fear nor tremble at excessively, nor
entirely pass over; but we ought, though it happen to be false, or
to be brought against us by the common herd, to try and extinguish
it immediately. For nothing so magnifies both an evil and a good
report as the undisciplined mob. For accustomed to hear and to
speak without stopping to make inquiry, they repeat at random
everything which comes in their way, without any regard to the
truth of it. Therefore the Bishop ought not to be unconcerned about
the multitude, but straightway to nip their evil surmisings in the
bud; persuading his accusers, even if they be the most unreasonable
of all men, and to omit nothing which is able to dispel an
ill-favored report. But if, when we do all this, they who blame us
will not be persuaded, thenceforward we should give them no
concern. Since if any one be too quick to be dejected by these
accidents, he will not be able at any time to produce anything
noble and admirable. For despondency and constant cares are mighty
for destroying the powers of the mind, and for reducing it to
extreme weakness. Thus then must the Priest behave towards those in
his charge, as a father would behave to his very young children;
and as such are not disturbed either by their insults or their
blows, or their lamentations, nor even if they laugh and rejoice
with us, do we take much account of it; so should we neither be
puffed up by the promises of these persons nor cast down at their
censure, when it comes from them unseasonably. But this is hard, my
good friend; and perhaps, methinks, even impossible. For I know not
whether any man ever succeeded in the effort not to be pleased when
he is praised, and the man who is pleased at this is likely also to
desire to enjoy it, and the man who desires to enjoy it will, of
necessity, be altogether vexed and beside himself whenever he
misses it. For as they who revel in being rich, when they fall into
poverty are grieved, and they who have been used to live
luxuriously cannot bear to live shabbily; so, too, they who long
for applause, not only when they are blamed without a cause, but
when they are not constantly being praised, become, as by some
famine, wasted in soul, particularly when they happen themselves to
have been used to praise, or if they hear others being praised. He
who enters upon the trial of preaching with desires of this kind,
how many annoyances and how many pangs dost thou think that he has?
It is no more possible for the sea to be without waves than that
man to be without cares and grief.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.vii-p10">5. For though the preacher may have great ability
(and this one would only find in a few), not even in this case is
he released from perpetual toil. For since preaching does not come
by nature, but by study, suppose a man to reach a high standard of
it, this will then forsake him if he does not cultivate his power
by constant application and exercise. So that there is greater
labor for the wiser than for the 
<pb n="72" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_72.html" id="iv.vii-Page_72" />unlearned. For there is not the same degree
of loss attending negligence on the part of the one and the other,
but the loss is in exact proportion to the difference between the
two possessions. For the latter<note place="end" n="195" id="iv.vii-p10.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vii-p11"> Sc. The unlearned.</p></note> no one would blame, as they furnish
nothing worth regarding. But the former, unless they are constantly
producing matter beyond the reputation in which all hold them,
great censure attends on all hands; and besides these things, the
latter would meet with considerable praise, even for small
performances, while the efforts of the former, unless they be
specially wonderful and startling, not only fail to win applause,
but meet with many fault-finders. For the audience set themselves
to be critics, not so much in judgment of what is said as of the
reputation of the speaker, so that whenever any one excels all
others in oratorical powers, then especially of all others does he
need laborious study. For this man is not allowed to avail himself
of the usual plea which human nature urges, that one cannot succeed
in everything; but if his sermons do not throughout correspond to
the greatness of the expectations formed, he will go away without
having gained anything but countless jeers and censures; and no one
takes this into consideration about him, that dejection and pain,
and anxiety, and often anger, may step in, and dim the clearness of
his thoughts and prevent his productions from coming from him
unalloyed,<note place="end" n="196" id="iv.vii-p11.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vii-p12"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.vii-p12.1">
εἰλικρινῆ</span>—literally, so that the sunlight fails to
discern a flaw in them.</p></note> and that on
the whole, being but a man, he cannot be constantly the same, nor
at all times acquit himself successfully, but naturally must
sometimes fall short of the mark, and appear on a lower level of
ability than usual. None of these things, as I said, are they
willing to take into consideration, but charge him with faults as
if they were sitting in judgment on an angel; though in other
cases, too, a man is apt to overlook the good performances of his
neighbor, though they be many and great, and if anywhere a defect
appears, even if it be accidental, even if it only occur at long
intervals, it is quickly perceived, and always remembered, and thus
small and trifling matters have often lessened the glory of many
and great doings.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.vii-p13">6. Thou seest, my excellent friend, that the
man who is powerful in preaching has peculiar need of greater study
than others; and besides study, of forbearance also greater than
what is needed by all those whom I have already mentioned. For thus
are many constantly springing up against him, in a vain and
senseless spirit, and having no fault to find with him, but that he
is generally approved of, hate him; and he must bear their bitter
malice nobly, for as they are not able to hide this cursed hatred,
which they so unreasonably entertain, they both revile, and
censure, and slander in private, and defame in public, and the mind
which has begun to be pained and exasperated, on every one of these
occasions, will not escape being corrupted by grief. For they will
not only revenge themselves upon him by their own acts, but will
try to do so by means of others, and often having chosen some one
of those who are unable to speak a word, will extol him with their
praises and admire him beyond his worth. Some do this through
ignorance alone,<note place="end" n="197" id="iv.vii-p13.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vii-p14"> Another reading is <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.vii-p14.1">
μανί‹</span>, infatuation.</p></note> some through
ignorance and envy, in order that they may ruin the reputation of
the other, not that they may prove the man to be wonderful who is
not so, and the noble-minded man has not only to struggle against
these, but often against the ignorance of the whole multitude; for
since it is not possible that all those who come together should
consist of learned men, but the chances are that the larger part of
the congregation is composed of unlearned people, and that even the
rest, who are clearer headed than they, fall as far short of being
able to criticize sermons as the remainder again fall short of
them; so that only one or two are seated there who possess this
power; it follows, of necessity, that he who preaches better than
others carries away less applause, and possibly goes home without
being praised at all, and he must be prepared to meet such
anomalies nobly, and to pardon those who commit them in ignorance,
and to weep for those who acquiesce in them on account of envy as
wretched and pitiable creatures, and not to consider that his
powers have become less on either of these accounts. For if a man,
being a pre-eminently good painter, and superior to all in his art,
sees the portrait which he has drawn with great accuracy held up to
ridicule, he ought not to be dejected, and to consider the picture
poor, because of the judgment of the ignorant; as he would not
consider the drawing that is really poor to be something wonderful
and lovely, because of the astonishment of the
inartistic.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.vii-p15">7. For let the best artificer be himself the critic
of his own designs, and let his performances be determined to be
good or poor, according as the mind which designed them gives
sentence upon them. But let him not even consider the opinion, so
erroneous and inartistic, of the outside world. Let, therefore, the
man who undertakes the strain of 
<pb n="73" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_73.html" id="iv.vii-Page_73" />teaching never give heed to the good opinion of
the outside world, nor be dejected in soul on account of such
persons; but laboring at his sermons so that he may please God,
(For let this alone be his rule and determination, in discharging
this best kind of workmanship, not acclamation, nor good opinions,)
if, indeed, he be praised by men, let him not repudiate their
applause, and when his hearers do not offer this, let him not seek
it, let him not be grieved. For a sufficient consolation in his
labors, and one greater than all, is when he is able to be
conscious of arranging and ordering his teaching with a view to
pleasing God.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.vii-p16">8. For if he be first carried away with the
desire for indiscriminate praise, he will reap no advantage from
his labors, or from his power in preaching, for the mind being
unable to bear the senseless censures of the multitude is
dispirited, and casts aside all earnestness about preaching.
Therefore it is especially necessary to be trained to be
indifferent to all kinds of praise. For to know how to preach is
not enough for the preservation of that power, if this be not
added: and if any one would examine accurately the man who is
destitute of this art, he will find that he needs to be indifferent
to praise no less than the other,<note place="end" n="198" id="iv.vii-p16.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vii-p17"> <i>i.e</i>., The skillful preacher.</p></note> for he will be forced to do many
wrong things in placing himself under the control of popular
opinion. For not having the energy to equal those who are in repute
for the quality of their preaching, he will not refrain from
forming ill designs against them, from envying them, and from
blaming them without reason, and from many such discreditable
practices, but will venture everything, even if it be needful to
ruin his own soul, for the sake of bringing down their fame to the
level of his own insignificance. And in addition to this, he will
leave off his exertions about his work; a kind of numbness, as it
were, spreading itself over his mind. For much toil, rewarded by
scanty praise, is sufficient to cast down a man who cannot despise
praise, and put him into a deep lethargy, since the husbandman even
when he spends time over some sorry piece of land, and is forced to
till a rock, quickly desists from his work, unless he is possessed
of much earnestness about the matter, or has a fear of famine
impending over him. For if they who are able to speak with
considerable power, need such constant exercise for the
preservation of their talent, he who collects no materials at all,
but is forced in the midst of his efforts to meditate; what
difficulty, what confusion, what trouble will he experience, in
order that he may be able at great labor to collect a few ideas!
and if any of those clergy who are under his authority, and who are
placed in the inferior order, be able in that position to appear to
better advantage than he; what a divine mind must he have, so as
not to be seized with envy or cast down by despondency. For, for
one to be placed in a station of higher dignity, and to be
surpassed by his inferior in rank, and to bear this nobly, would
not be the part of any ordinary mind, nor of such as my own, but of
one as hard as adamant; and if, indeed, the man who is in greater
repute be very forbearing and modest, the suffering becomes so much
the more easily borne. But if he is bold and boastful and
vainglorious, a daily death would be desirable for the other; he
will so embitter his life, insulting him to his face, and laughing
at him behind his back, wresting much of his authority from him,
and wishing to be everything himself. But he is possessed of the
greatest security, in all these circumstances, who has fluency in
preaching, and the earnest attention of the multitude about him,
and the affection of all those who are under his charge. Dost not
thou know what a passion for sermons has burst in upon the minds of
Christians now-a-days? and that they who practice themselves in
preaching are in especial honor, not only among the heathen, but
among them of the household of the faith? How then could any one
bear such disgrace as to find that all are mute when he is
preaching, and think that they are oppressed, and wait for the end
of the sermon, as for some release from work; while they listen to
another with eagerness though he preach long, and are sorry when he
is about to conclude; and almost angry when it is his purpose to be
silent. If these matters seem to thee to be small, and easily to be
despised, it is because of thine inexperience. They are truly
enough to quench zeal, and to paralyze the powers of the mind,
unless a man withdraw himself from all human passions, and study to
frame his conduct after the pattern of those incorporeal powers,
who are neither pursued by envy, nor by longing for fame, nor by
any other morbid feeling. If then there be any man so constituted
as to be able to subdue this wild beast, so difficult to capture,
so unconquerable, so fierce; that is to say, public fame, and to
cut off its many heads, or rather to forbid their growth
altogether; he will easily be able to repel these many violent
assaults, and to enjoy a kind of quiet haven of rest. But he who
has not freed himself from this monster, involves his soul in
struggles of various kinds, and perpetual agitation, and the burden
both of despondency and of other passions. But why need I detail
the rest of these difficulties, which no one will be able to
describe, or to learn unless he has had actual experience of
them.</p>

will they one day suffer, what kind of penalty will they pay, who
destroy not one only, or two, or three, but so many multitudes? For
it is not possible for inexperience to be urged as an excuse, nor
to take refuge in ignorance, nor for the plea of necessity or force
to be put forward. Yea, if it were possible, one of those under
their charge could more easily make use of this refuge for his own
sins than bishops in the case of the sins of others. Dost thou ask
why? Because he who has been appointed to rectify the ignorance of
others, and to warn them beforehand of the conflict with the devil
which is coming upon them, will not be able to put forward
ignorance as his excuse, or to say, “I have never heard the
trumpet sound, I did not foresee the conflict.” For he is set for
that very purpose, says Ezekiel, that he may sound the trumpet for
others, and warn them of the dangers at hand. And therefore his
chastisement is inevitable, though he that perishes happen to be
but one. “For if when the sword comes, the <pb n="75" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_75.html" id="iv.viii-Page_75" />watchman does not sound the
trumpet to the people, nor give them a sign, and the sword come and

<p class="c10" id="iv.viii-p7">2. Cease then to urge us on to a penalty so
inevitable; for our discourse is not about an army, or a kingdom;
but about an office which needs the virtues of an angel. For the
soul of the Priest ought to be purer than the very sunbeams, in
order that the Holy Spirit may not leave him desolate, in order
that he may be able to say, “Now I live; and yet no longer I, but
Christ liveth in me.”<note place="end" n="203" id="iv.viii-p7.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.viii-p8"> <scripRef passage="Gal. ii. 20" id="iv.viii-p8.1" parsed="|Gal|2|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gal.2.20">Gal. ii.

desert, and are removed far from the city and the market-place, and
the tumult therein, and who enjoy all their time a haven of rest,
and of peacefulness, are not willing to rely on the security of
that manner of life, but add to it numberless other safeguards,
hedging themselves round on every side, and studying both to speak
and to act with great circumspection, so that to the utmost extent
of human power they may draw near to God with assurance, and with
unstained purity, what power and strength, thinkest thou, does the
ordained Priest need so as to be able to tear his soul away from
every defilement, and to keep its spiritual beauty unsullied? For
he has need of far greater purity than they; and whoever has need
of greater purity, he too is subject to more pressing temptations
than they, which are able to defile him, unless by using constant
self-denial and much labor, he renders his soul inaccessible to
them. For beauty of face, elegance of movement, an affected gait
and lisping voice, pencilled eyebrows and enamelled cheeks,
elaborate braiding and dyeing of hair, costliness of dress, variety
of golden ornaments, and the glory of precious stones, the scent of
perfumes, and all those other matters to which womankind devote
themselves, are enough to disorder the mind, unless it happen to be
hardened against them, through much austerity of self restraint.
Now to be disturbed indeed by such things is nothing wonderful. But
on the other hand, that the devil should be able to hit and shoot
down the souls of men by the opposite of these—this is a matter
which fills us with astonishment and perplexity.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.viii-p9">3. For ere now some men who have escaped these
snares, have been caught by others widely differing from these. For
even a neglected appearance, unkempt hair, squalid dress, and an
unpainted face, simple behavior, and homely language, unstudied
gait, and unaffected voice, a life of poverty, a despised,
unpatronized and lonely condition, have first drawn on the beholder
to pity, and next to utter ruin; and many who have escaped the
former nets, in the way of gold ornaments and perfumes, and
apparel, and all the rest, of which I have spoken as connected with
them, have easily fallen into these so widely differing from them,
and have perished. When then both by poverty and by riches, both by
the adornment and the neglect of the personal appearance, both by
studied and unaffected manners, in short by all those means which I
have enumerated, war is kindled in the soul of the beholder, and
its artifices surround him on every side, how will he be able to
breathe freely while so many snares encompass him? and what
hiding-place will he be able to find—I do not say so as to avoid
being forcibly seized by them (for this is not altogether
difficult)—but so as to keep his own soul undisturbed by
polluting thoughts?</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.viii-p10">And I pass by honors, which are the cause of
countless evils. For those which come from the hands of women are
ruinous to the vigor of self-restraint, and often overthrow it when
a man does not know how to watch constantly against such designs;
while those which come from the hands of men, unless a man receive
them with much nobleness of mind, he is seized with two contrary
emotions, servile flattery and senseless pride. To those who
patronize him, he is obliged to cringe; and towards his inferiors
he is puffed up, on account of the honors which the others confer,
and is driven into the gulf of arrogance. We have mentioned these
matters indeed, but how harmful they actually are, no one could
well learn without experience. For not only these snares, but
greater and more delusive than these, he must needs encounter, who
has his conversation in the world. But he who is content with
solitude, has freedom from all this, and if at any time a strange
thought creates a representation of this kind, the image is weak,
and capable of being speedily subdued, because there is no fuel
added to the flame from without, arising from actual sight. For the
recluse has but himself to fear for; or should he be forced to have
the care of others they are easily counted: and if they be many,
yet they are less than those in our Churches, and they give him who
is set over them much lighter anxiety about them, not only on
account of their fewness, but because they are all free from
worldly concerns, and have neither wife nor children, nor any such
thing to care about; and this makes them very deferential to their
rulers, and allows them to share the same abode with them, so that
they are able to take in their failings accurately at a glance and
correct them, seeing that the constant 
<pb n="76" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_76.html" id="iv.viii-Page_76" />supervision of a teacher is no little help
towards advance in virtue.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.viii-p11">4. But of those who are subject to the Priest, the
greater number are hampered with the cares of this life, and this
makes them the slower in the performance of spiritual duties.
Whence it is necessary for the teacher to sow every day (so to
speak), in order that by its frequency at least, the word of
doctrine may be able to be grasped by those who hear. For excessive
wealth, and an abundance of power, and sloth the offspring of
luxury, and many other things beside these, choke the seeds which
have been let fall. Often too the thick growth of thorns does not
suffer the seed to drop even upon the surface of the soil. Again,
excess of trouble, stress of poverty, constant insults, and other
such things, the reverse of the foregoing, take the mind away from
anxiety about things divine; and of their people’s sins, not even
the smallest part can become apparent; for how should it, in the
case of those the majority of whom they do not know even by
sight?</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.viii-p12">The Priest’s relations with his people
involve thus much difficulty. But if any inquire about his
relations with God, he will find the others to be as nothing, since
these require a greater and more thorough earnestness. For he who
acts as an ambassador on behalf of the whole city—but why do I
say the city? on behalf of the whole world indeed—prays that God
would be merciful to the sins of all, not only of the living, but
also of the departed.<note place="end" n="204" id="iv.viii-p12.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.viii-p13"> All the ancient Liturgies contained prayers for the
departed. St. Cyril of Jerusalem (Catech. Mystag., v. n. vi.),
speaking of the prayer after consecration, says: “and then we
pray for our holy fathers and bishops, and for all that have fallen
asleep before us, believing that it will be a very great benefit to
their souls to have supplication offered for them whilst the holy
and most awful sacrifice is lying upon the altar,” but the
practice was not based upon anything like the later Roman doctrine
of purgatory. It was the natural expression of a devout belief in
the “communion of saints.” See Bingham’s Antiquities, Book
xv.</p></note> What manner of man ought he to be?
For my part I think that the boldness of speech of Moses and Elias,
is insufficient for such supplication. For as though he were
entrusted with the whole world and were himself the father of all
men, he draws near to God, beseeching that wars may be extinguished
everywhere, that tumults may be quelled; asking for peace and
plenty, and a swift deliverance from all the ills that beset each
one, publicly and privately; and he ought as much to excel in every
respect all those on whose behalf he prays, as rulers should excel
their subjects.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.viii-p14">And whenever he invokes the Holy Spirit, and
offers the most dread sacrifice, and constantly handles the common
Lord of all, tell me what rank shall we give him? What great purity
and what real piety must we demand of him? For consider what manner
of hands they ought to be which minister in these things, and of
what kind his tongue which utters such words,<note place="end" n="205" id="iv.viii-p14.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.viii-p15"> “And we pray and beseech Thee, send down thy Holy
Ghost upon us and upon these gifts here outspread, and make this
bread to be the precious body of thy Christ, and that which is in
the cup the precious blood of Christ, having so changed them by thy
Holy Spirit that to us who partake of them they may be for the
cleansing of our souls, the remission of sins, the communion of the
Holy Spirit.” (Liturgy of St. Chrysostom.)</p></note> and ought not the soul which
receives so great a spirit to be purer and holier than anything in
the world? At such a time angels stand by the Priest; and the whole
sanctuary, and the space round about the altar, is filled with the
powers of heaven, in honor of Him who lieth thereon. For this,
indeed, is capable of being proved from the very rites which are
being then celebrated. I myself, moreover, have heard some one once
relate, that a certain aged, venerable man, accustomed to see
revelations, used to tell him, that he being thought worthy of a
vision of this kind, at such a time, saw, on a sudden, so far as
was possible for him, a multitude of angels, clothed in shining
robes, and encircling the altar, and bending down, as one might see
soldiers in the presence of their King, and for my part I believe
it. Moreover another told me, without learning it from some one
else, but as being himself thought worthy to be both an ear and eye
witness of it, that, in the case of those who are about to depart
hence, if they happen to be partakers of the mysteries, with a pure
conscience, when they are about to breathe their last, angels keep
guard over them for the sake of what they have received, and bear
them hence. And dost thou not yet tremble to introduce a soul into
so sacred a mystery of this kind, and to advance to the dignity of
the Priesthood, one robed in filthy raiment, whom Christ has shut
out from the rest of the band of guests?<note place="end" n="206" id="iv.viii-p15.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.viii-p16"> <scripRef passage="Matt. xxii. 13" id="iv.viii-p16.1" parsed="|Matt|22|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.22.13">Matt.
xxii. 13</scripRef>.</p></note> The soul of the Priest should shine
like a light beaming over the whole world. But mine has so great
darkness overhanging it, because of my evil conscience, as to be
always cast down and never able to look up with confidence to its
Lord. Priests are the salt of the earth.<note place="end" n="207" id="iv.viii-p16.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.viii-p17"> <scripRef passage="Matt. v. 13" id="iv.viii-p17.1" parsed="|Matt|5|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.13">Matt. v.
13</scripRef>.</p></note> But who would easily put up with my
lack of understanding, and my inexperience in all things, but thou,
who hast been wont to love me beyond measure. For the Priest ought
not only to be thus pure as one who has been dignified with so high
a ministry, but very discreet, and skilled in many matters, and to
be as well versed in the affairs of this life as they who are
engaged in the world, and yet to be free from them all more than
the recluses who occupy the mountains. For since he must mix with
men who have wives, and who bring up children, who possess
servants, and are surrounded with 
<pb n="77" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_77.html" id="iv.viii-Page_77" />wealth, and fill public positions, and are
persons of influence, he too should be a many-sided man—I say
many-sided, not unreal, nor yet fawning and hypocritical, but full
of much freedom and assurance, and knowing how to adapt himself
profitably, where the circumstances of the case require it, and to
be both kind and severe, for it is not possible to treat all those
under one’s charge on one plan, since neither is it well for
physicians to apply one course of treatment to all their sick, nor
for a pilot to know but one way of contending with the winds. For,
indeed, continual storms beset this ship of ours, and these storms
do not assail from without only, but take their rise from within,
and there is need of much condescension, and circumspection, and
all these different matters have one end in view, the glory of God,
and the edifying of the Church.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.viii-p18">5. Great is the conflict which recluses
undergo, and much their toil.<note place="end" n="208" id="iv.viii-p18.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.viii-p19"> The following descriptions of monastic life were no
doubt drawn from the habits of the monks in the neighbourhood of
Antioch, who dwelt on the mountainous heights of Silpius and
Casius, south of the city. They lived in separate huts or cabins,
but were subject to an abbot and a common rule, probably very
similar to that which Pachomius had recently established in Egypt,
and which became very generally adopted in the East. There are
frequent allusions to the habits of these monks in Chrysostom’s
Homilies. See especially St. Matt. Hom. LXVIII. c. 3, and LXIX. c.
3; also Life of St. Chrysostom by the translator, pp. 59–68, 3d
ed.</p></note> But if any one compare their
exertions with those which the right exercise of the Priesthood
involves, he will find the difference as great as the distance
between a king and a commoner. For there, if the labor is great
indeed, yet the conflict is common to body and soul, or rather the
greater part of it is accomplished by the condition of the body,
and if this be not strong, the inclination remains undeveloped, and
is unable to come out into action. For the habit of intense
fasting, and sleeping on the ground, and keeping vigil, and
refraining from the bath, and great toil, and all other means which
they use for the affliction of the body are given up, when the body
to be thus disciplined is not strong. But in this case purity of
soul is the business in hand, and no bodily vigor is required to
show its excellence. For what does strength of body contribute
towards our being not self-willed, or proud, or headstrong, but
sober and prudent, and orderly, and all else, wherein St. Paul
filled up the picture of the perfect Priest? But no one could say
this of the virtues of the recluse.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.viii-p20">6. But as in the case of wonder-workers, a large
apparatus is required, both wheels and ropes and daggers; while the
philosopher has the whole of his art stored up in his mind, not
requiring any external appliances: So accordingly in the case
before us. The recluse requires both a good condition of body, and
a place suitable for his course of life, in order that such may not
be settled too far from intercourse with their fellow men, and may
have the tranquillity which belongs to desert places, and yet
further, may not fail to enjoy the most favorable climate. For
nothing is so unbearable to a body worn with fastings as a climate
which is not equable. And what trouble they are compelled to take
in the preparation of their clothing and daily food, as they are
themselves ambitious of doing all with their own hands, I need not
speak of now. But the Priest will require none of these things to
supply his wants, but is unconcerned about them, and participates
in all things which are harmless, while he has all his skill stored
up in the treasure-house of his mind. But if any one admire a
solitary life, and retirement from the society of the multitude, I
should say myself that such a life was a token of patience, but not
a sufficient proof of entire fortitude of soul. For the man who
sits at the helm in harbor, does not yet give any certain proof of
his art. But if one is able to guide his ship safely in the midst
of the sea, no one would deny him to be an excellent steersman.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.viii-p21">7. It would be, therefore, in no wise excessively
surprising to us, that the recluse, living as he does by himself,
is undisturbed and does not commit many and great sins. For he does
not meet with things which irritate and excite his mind. But if any
one who has devoted himself to whole multitudes, and has been
compelled to bear the sins of many, has remained steadfast and
firm, guiding his soul in the midst of the storm as if he were in a
calm, he is the man to be justly applauded and admired of all, for
he has shown sufficient proof of personal manliness. Do not thou,
therefore, for thy part wonder if I, who avoid the market-place and
the haunts of the multitude, have not many to accuse me. For I
ought not to wonder, if I sinned not when asleep, nor fell when I
did not wrestle, nor was hit if I did not fight. For who, tell me,
who will be able to speak against me, and reveal my depravity? Can
this roof or cell? Nay, they would not be able to give tongue?
Would my mother, who best of all knows my affairs? Well, certainly
with her I am neither in communication, nor have we ever come to a
quarrel, and if this had happened, no mother is so heartless and
wanting in affection for her child as to revile and accuse before
all him whom she travailed with, and brought forth, and reared, if
there were no reason to constrain her, nor any person to urge her
to such an act. Nevertheless, if any one desires to make a careful
inspection of my mind, he will discover much which is corrupt
there. Nor art thou unaware of this who art specially wont to extol
me with <pb n="78" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_78.html" id="iv.viii-Page_78" />praises before all. Now
that I do not say these things out of mere modesty, recollect how
often I said to thee, when this subject was being discussed between
us, “If any one were to give me my choice whether I would rather
gain distinction in the oversight of the Church, or in the life of
the recluse, I would vote a thousand times over for accepting the
former. For I have never failed to congratulate those who have been
able to discharge this office well, and no one will gainsay that
what I counted blessed I would not have shunned were I able to take
part in it fitly. But what am I to do? There is nothing so
prejudicial to the oversight of the Church as this inactivity and
negligence of mine, which others think to be a sort of
self-discipline, but which I hold to be a veil as it were of my
personal infirmity, covering the greater number of my defects and
not suffering them to appear. For he who is accustomed to enjoy
such great freedom from business, and to pass his time in much
repose, even if he be of a noble nature, is confused by his
inexperience, and is disturbed, and his inactivity deprives him of
no small part of his natural ability. But when, besides, he is of
slow intellect, and ignorant also of these severe trials, which I
take it is my case, he will carry on this ministry which he has
received no better than a statue. Wherefore of those who have come
to such great trial, out of that school, few shine; and the greater
part betray themselves, and fall, and undergo much hardship and
sufferings; and no wonder. For the trials and the discipline are
not concerned with the same things. The man who is contending in no
wise differs from those who are untrained. He who thus enters this
list should despise glory, be superior to anger, full of great
discretion. But for the exercise of these qualities there is no
scope in his case who affects a secluded life. For he does not have
many to provoke him in order that he may practise chastising, the
force of his anger: nor admirers and applauders in order that he
may be trained to despise the praises of the multitudes. And of the
discretion which is required in the Church, there is no taking
account in their case. Whenever, therefore, they come to the trials
of which they have never had practical experience, they get
bewildered, their heads are turned, they fall into a state of
helplessness, and besides adding nothing to their excellence, may
have often lost that which they brought with them.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.viii-p22">8. <span class="c12" id="iv.viii-p22.1">Basil</span>: What then?
shall we set over the administration of the Church those who move
in society, and who are careful about the concerns of this world,
who are adepts at wrangling and vituperation, are full of countless
artifices, and versed in luxurious ways?</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.viii-p23"><span class="c12" id="iv.viii-p23.1">Chrysostom</span>: Hush,
dear friend that thou art! Thou shouldest never entertain in thy
thoughts such men as these, when the Priesthood is under
discussion, but only such as are able after mixing and associating
with all, to keep their purity undefiled, and their unworldliness,
their holiness, constancy and sobriety unshaken, and to possess all
other virtues which belong to recluses, in a greater degree than
they. He who has many defects, but is able to hide them, by means
of his seclusion, and to make them ineffectual, because he does not
associate with any one, when <i>he</i> comes into society will gain
nothing, but the position of a laughing-stock, and will run greater
risks still, which I was very nearly experiencing myself, had not
the providence of God quickly warded off such fire from my head.
For it is not possible for one in such a position to escape notice
when he is so conspicuously placed, but everything then is
detected, and as the fire tests the material of metals, so too the
trial of the clerical office searches the souls of mortal men; and
if any one be passionate or mean, or ambitious of fame, if he be
boastful, or anything else of the kind, it unveils all; and
speedily lays bare his defects, and not only lays them bare, but
increases their painfulness and strength. For the wounds of the
body, if they are galled, become harder to heal, and the emotions
of the mind when chafed and irritated, are naturally more
exasperated, and those who possess them are driven to commit
greater sins. For they excite him who does not restrain them, to
love of glory, and to boastfulness, and to desire for this
world’s goods, and draw him downwards, both to luxury and laxity
of life, and to laziness, and, little by little, to evils worse
than these which result from them. For many are the circumstances
in society which have the power to upset the balance of the mind,
and to hinder its straightforward course;<note place="end" n="209" id="iv.viii-p23.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.viii-p24"> Another reading gives its “career towards
God.”</p></note> and first of all is his social
intercourse with women. For it is not possible for the Bishop, and
one who is concerned with the whole flock, to have a care for the
male portion of it, but to pass over the female, which needs more
particular forethought, because of its propensity to sins. But the
man who is appointed to the administration of a Bishopric must have
a care for the moral health of these, if not in a greater, at least
in no less a degree than the others. For it is necessary to visit
them when they are sick, to comfort them when they are sorrowful,
and to reprove them when they are idle, 
<pb n="79" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_79.html" id="iv.viii-Page_79" />and to help them when they are distressed; and in
such cases the evil one would find many opportunities of approach,
if a man did not fortify himself with a very strict guard. For the
eye, not only of the unchaste, but of the modest woman pierces and
disturbs the mind. Flatteries enervate it, and favors enslave it,
and fervent love—the spring one may say of all good—becomes the
cause of countless evils to those who do not make a right use of
it. Constant cares too have ere now blunted the edge of the
understanding, and have made that which was buoyant heavier than
lead, while anger has burst in like smoke, and taken possession of
all the inner man.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.viii-p25">9. Why should any one speak of the injuries
that result from grief,<note place="end" n="210" id="iv.viii-p25.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.viii-p26"> According to a different reading, <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.viii-p26.1">τὰς λσιπὰς βχ€βας</span>, “The injuries which

from superiors, from inferiors, from the wise, and from fools; for
the class who are wanting in right judgment are particularly fond
of censuring, and will never readily allow any excuse. But the
truly excellent Bishop ought neither to think lightly of these, but
to clear himself with all men of the charges which they bring
against him, with great forbearance and meekness, pardoning their
unreasonable fault-finding, rather than being indignant and angry
about it. For if St. Paul feared lest he should incur a suspicion
of theft, among his disciples, and therefore procured others for
the management of the money, that “no one” he says, “should
blame us in this abundance which is administered by us,”<note place="end" n="211" id="iv.viii-p26.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.viii-p27"> <scripRef passage="2 Cor. viii. 20" id="iv.viii-p27.1" parsed="|2Cor|8|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.8.20">2 Cor.

not to do all so as to remove evil suspicions, even if they happen
to be false, and most unreasonable, and very foreign to our
thought? For we are not so utterly removed from any sin as St. Paul
from theft; notwithstanding, though so far from this evil practice,
he did not, therefore, slight the suspicion of the world, although
it was very absurd, and even insane. For it was madness to have any
such suspicion about that blessed and admirable character. But none
the less does he remove far off the causes of this suspicion,
unreasonable though it was, and such as no one who was in his
senses would entertain, and he neither disdained the folly of the
multitudes, nor did he say, “To whose mind did it ever occur to
suspect such things of us, after the signs which I have wrought,
and the forbearance which has marked my life, and when you all
revered and admired us?” Quite the contrary: he foresaw and
expected this base suspicion, and pulled it up by the roots, or
rather did not suffer it to grow at all. Why? “Because,” saith
he, “we provide things honest not only before the Lord, but
before all men.”<note place="end" n="212" id="iv.viii-p27.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.viii-p28"> <scripRef passage="2 Cor. viii. 21; Rom. xii. 17" id="iv.viii-p28.1" parsed="|2Cor|8|21|0|0;|Rom|12|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.8.21 Bible:Rom.12.17">2 Cor.

must we use, to uproot and prevent floating reports which are not
good, but to see beforehand from afar whence they come, and to
remove beforehand the causes from which they are produced, not to
wait till they are established and are the common topics in every
one’s mouth. For then it is not easy in the future to destroy
them, but very difficult, perhaps impossible, and not without
mischief, because this is done after many have been injured. But
how far shall I continue pursuing the unattainable? For to
enumerate all the difficulties in this direction, is nothing more
nor less than measuring the ocean. Even when any one should clear
himself from every passion (which is a thing impossible) in order
to correct the failings of others, he is forced to undergo
countless trials, and when his own infirmities are added, behold,
an abyss of toil and care, and all that he must suffer, who wishes
to subdue the evils in himself and in those around him.</p>

even now. For how is it possible for one who is a man, and who is
living this toilsome life of ours, to be free from cares and
conflict? But it is not quite the same thing for man to plunge into
a boundless ocean and to cross a river, so great is the difference
between these cares and those. For now, indeed, if I were able to
become serviceable to others, I should wish it myself, and this
would be a matter of prayer with me. But if it is not possible to
help another, yet if it be practicable to save and rescue myself
from the waves, I shall be contented.</p>

Nevertheless, I think that my punishment will be milder when I am
called to account, because I have not saved others, than it would
be if I should destroy myself and others too by becoming far worse
after so great an honor. For now I trust that my chastisement will
be proportioned <pb n="80" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_80.html" id="iv.viii-Page_80" />to the
amount of my sins, but after receiving this office, I fear it would

caused very many to stumble, and after additional honor should have
offended the God who honored me.</p>

the times of the prophets, wishing to show that sins receive sorer

part, that the wounds of the Priesthood need more assistance—that
is, as great as those of all the people together, and they would
not have needed a greater, except they were worse; and they are not
worse in their nature, but are aggravated through the dignity of
the Priest, who dares to commit them. And why do I speak of the <i>
men</i> who follow this ministration. For the daughters of the
Priests,<note place="end" n="217" id="iv.viii-p37.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.viii-p38"> <scripRef passage="Lev. xxi. 9" id="iv.viii-p38.1" parsed="|Lev|21|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Lev.21.9">Lev. xxi.

part in the Priestly office, yet on account of their father’s
dignity undergo a far bitterer punishment for the same sins as
others, and the offense is the same in their case and in the
daughters of the laity; namely, fornication in both; yet the
penalty is far severer for the former. Dost thou see with what
abundant proof God shows thee that he demands much greater
punishment for the ruler than for the ruled? For no doubt he who
punishes to a greater degree than others the daughter of a certain
man for that man’s sake, will not exact the same penalty from the
man who is the cause of her additional chastisement as from others,
but a much heavier one; and very reasonably; for the mischief does
not merely involve himself, but it destroys the souls of the weaker
brethren and of them who look up to him, and Ezekiel, writing to
show this, distinguishes from one another the judgment of the rams
and of the sheep.<note place="end" n="218" id="iv.viii-p38.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.viii-p39"> <scripRef passage="Ez. xxxiv. 17" id="iv.viii-p39.1" parsed="|Ezek|34|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ezek.34.17">Ez. xxxiv.

<p class="c10" id="iv.viii-p40">12. Do we then seem to thee to entertain a
reasonable fear? for in addition to what has been said, although
much toil is needful on my part, so that I should not be completely
overwhelmed by the passions of my soul, yet I endure the toil, and
I do not shun the conflict. For even now I am taken captive by
vainglory, but I often recover myself, and I see at a glance that I
have been taken, and there are times when I rebuke my soul, which
has been enslaved; outrageous desires even now come over me, but
they kindle only a languid flame, since my bodily eyes cannot
fasten upon any fuel to feed the fire. From speaking ill of any, or
from hearing any one evil spoken of, I am utterly removed, since I
have no one to talk with; for surely these walls would never give
tongue; yet it is not altogether in like manner possible to avoid
anger, although there be none to provoke it. For often when the
recollection of outrageous men has come over me, and of the deeds
done by them, it makes my heart swell. But not permanently, for I
quickly subdue its kindling, and persuade it to be quiet, saying
that it is very inexpedient and extremely despicable to leave
one’s own fault alone, and to busy one’s self about the faults
of one’s neighbors. But were I to come among the multitude, and
to be involved in countless excitements, I should not be able to
have the benefit of this warning, nor to experience reflections
which take me thus to task. But just as they who are driven over
precipices by a torrent, or in some other way, are able to foresee
the destruction to which they are finally going, and are unable to
think of any means of help, so I, when I have fallen into the great
tumult of my passions, shall be able to see at a glance my
chastisement daily increasing. But to be master of myself as I am
now, and to rebuke diseases of this sort raging on every side,
would not be equally easy for me as it was before. For my soul is
weak and puny, and easily mastered, not only by these passions, but
by envy, which is bitterer than all of them. Neither does it know
how to bear insults or honors temperately. But these do exceedingly
elate it, while those depress it. As, then, savage wild beasts,
when they are in good condition, and in full vigor, overcome those
that fight with them, particularly, too, if they be feeble and
unskillful; but if any one were to weaken them by starvation, he
will put their rage to sleep, and will extinguish most of their
strength; so that one, not over valiant, might take up the conflict
and battle with them: so also with the passions of the soul. He who
makes them weak, places them in subjection to right reason; but he
who nourishes them carefully, makes his battle with them harder,
and renders them so formidable that he passes all his time in
bondage and fear.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.viii-p41">What then is the food of these wild beasts? Of
vainglory, indeed, it is honors and applause; of pride, abundance
of authority and power; 
<pb n="81" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_81.html" id="iv.viii-Page_81" />of envy, the reputation of one’s
neighbors; of avarice, the munificence of the generous; of
incontinence, luxury and the constant society of women; and other
passions have their proper nutriment? And all these things will
sorely attack me if I come forth into the world, and will tear my
soul to pieces, will be the more formidable and will make my battle
with them the harder. Whereas, while I am established here they
will be subdued; and then, indeed, only with great exertion; yet at
the same time, by the Grace of God, they <i>will</i> be subdued,
and there will not be anything worse then than their bark. For
these reasons I keep to this cell, and am inaccessible,
self-contained, and unsociable, and I put up with hearing countless
complaints of this kind, although I would gladly efface them, and
have been vexed and grieved because I cannot; for it is not easy
for me to become sociable, and at the same time to remain in my
present security. Therefore I beseech thee, too, to pity rather
than to censure one beset with such great difficulty.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.viii-p42">But we cannot yet persuade thee. Accordingly the
time is now come that I should utter to thee the only thing which I
have left unspoken. Perhaps it may seem to many to be incredible,
but even so I shall not be ashamed to bring it before the world,
for though what is said is proof of an evil conscience and of many
sins, yet, since God, who is about to judge us, knows all
accurately, what gain will result to us from the ignorance of men?
What then is this, which is yet unspoken? From that day on which
thou didst impart to me the suspicion of the bishopric, my whole
system has often been in danger of being completely unhinged, such
was the fear, such the despondency which seized my soul; for on
considering the glory of the Bride of Christ, the holiness, the
spiritual beauty and wisdom, and comeliness, and then reckoning up
my own faults, I used not to cease bewailing both her and myself,
and amidst continual distress and perplexity, I kept saying—who
then made such a suggestion as this? why has the Church of God made
so great a mistake? why has she so provoked her Master, as to be
delivered over to me, the unworthiest of all men, and to undergo
such great disgrace? Considering these things often by myself, and
being unable to bear the thought of so monstrous a thing, I used to
be like thunderstruck people, speechless, and unable either to see
or hear. And when this condition of great helplessness left me, for
there were times when it passed off, tears and despondency
succeeded to it, and after the flood of tears, then fear again,
entered in their stead, disturbing, confusing and agitating my
mind. In such a tempest I used to pass the time that is gone; but
thou wast ignorant of it, and thoughtest that I was spending my
time in a perfect tranquillity, but I will now try and unveil to
thee the storm of my soul, for it may be thou wilt henceforth
pardon me, abandoning your accusations. How then shall I unveil
this to thee? For if thou wouldest see this clearly, it is not
otherwise possible than by laying bare my own heart; but as this is
impossible, I will try and show you as well as I can, by a certain
faint illustration, the gloom of my despondency, and from this
image please to infer my condition.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.viii-p43">Let us suppose that the daughter of the King of all
the earth under the sun is the betrothed of a certain man, and that
this damsel has matchless beauty, transcending that of human
nature, and that in this respect she outstrips by a long distance
the whole race of women; also that she has virtues of the soul, so
great as to distance by a long way the whole generation of men that
have been, or that shall be; and that the grace of her manners
transcends all standards of art, and that the loveliness of her
person is eclipsed by the beauty of her countenance; and that her
betrothed, not only for the sake of these things, is enamored of
the maiden, but apart from these things has an affection for her,
and by his ardor throws into the shade the most passionate of
lovers that ever were. Then let us suppose, whilst he is burning
with love, he hears from some quarter that some mean, abject man,
low born, and crippled in body, in fact a thoroughly bad fellow,
was about to wed this wondrous, well-beloved maiden. Have we then
presented to thee some small portion of our grief? and is it enough
to stay my illustration at this point? So far as my despondency is
concerned, I think it is enough; for this was the only purpose for
which I introduced the comparison, but that I may show you the
measure of my fear, and my terror, let me proceed to another
description.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.viii-p44">Let there be an armament composed of infantry,
cavalry, and marines, and let a number of triremes cover the sea,
and phalanxes of foot and horse cover most of the plains, and the
ridges of the mountains, and let the metal of their armor reflect
the sunshine, and the glitter of the helmets and shields be
reflected by the beams which are emitted from them; let the
clashing of spears and the neighing of horses be borne up to the
very heavens, and let neither sea nor land appear, but only brass
and iron in every direction. Let the enemy be drawn up in battle
array opposite to these, fierce and savage men, and let the time of
the engagement be now at hand. Then let some one suddenly seize
some young lad, one of <pb n="82" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_82.html" id="iv.viii-Page_82" />those
brought up in the country, knowing nothing but the use of the
shepherd’s pipe and crook; let him be clad in brazen armor, and
let him be led round the whole camp and be shown the squadrons and
their officers, the archers, slingers, captains, generals, the foot
and horse, the spearmen, the triremes and their commanders, the
dense mass of soldiers in the ships, and the multitude of engines
of war lying ready on board. Let him be shown, moreover, the whole
array of the enemy, their repulsive aspect, and the varied stores
and unusual quantity of their arms; the ravines also and precipices
of the mountains, deep and difficult. Let him be shown further on
the enemies’ side, horses flying by some enchantment and infantry
borne through the air, and sorcery of every power and form; and let
him consider the calamities of war, the cloud of spears, the
hailstorm of arrows, that great mist and obscurity that gloomiest
night which the multitude of weapons occasions, eclipsing the
sunbeams with their cloud, the dust no less than the darkness
baffling the eyesight. The torrents of blood, the groanings of the
falling, the shouts of the surviving, the heaps of slain, wheels
bathed in blood, horses with their riders thrown headlong down,
owing to the number of corpses, the ground a scene of general
confusion, blood, and bows, and arrows, hoofs of horses and heads
of men lying together, a human arm and a chariot wheel and a
helmet, a breast pierced through, brains sticking to swords, the
point of a dart broken off with an eye transfixed upon it. Then let
him reckon up the sufferings of the naval force, the triremes
burning in the midst of the waves, and sinking with their armed
crews, the roaring of the sea, the tumult of the sailors, the shout
of the soldiers, the foam of the waves mixed with blood, and
dashing over into all the ships; the corpses on the decks, some
sinking, some floating, some cast upon the beach, overwhelmed by
the waves, and obstructing the passage of the ships. And when he
has been carefully instructed in all the tragedy of warfare, let
the horrors of captivity and of slavery be added to it, worse than
any kind of death; and having told him all this, bid him mount his
horse straightway, and take command of all that armament.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.viii-p45">Dost thou really think that this lad would be equal
to more than the mere description, and would not, at the very first
glance, lose heart?</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.viii-p46">13. Do not think that I have exaggerated the matter
by my account, nor suppose that because we are shut up in this
body, as in some prison house, and are unable to see anything of
the invisible world, that what has been said is overstated. For
thou wouldest see a far greater and more formidable conflict than
this, couldest thou ever behold, with these eyes of thine, the
devil’s most gloomy battle array, and his frantic onset. For
there is no brass or iron there. No horses, or chariots or wheels,
no fire and darts. These are visible things. But there are other
much more fearful engines than these. One does not need against
these enemies breastplate or shield, sword and spear, yet the sight
only of this accursed array is enough to paralyze the soul, unless
it happen to be very noble, and to enjoy in a high degree as a
protection to its own courage the providential care of God. And if
it were possible by putting off this body, or still keeping it, to
see clearly and fearlessly with the naked eye the whole of his
battle array, and his warfare against us, thou wouldest see no
torrents of blood, nor dead bodies, but so many fallen souls, and
such disastrous wounds that the whole of that description of
warfare which I just now detailed to thee thou wouldest think to be
mere child’s sport and pastime rather than war: so many are there
smitten every day, and the wounds in the two cases do not bring
about the same death, but as great as is the difference between the
soul from the body, so great is the difference between that death
and this. For when the soul receives a wound, and falls, it does
not lie as a lifeless body, but it is thenceforth tormented, being
gnawed by an evil conscience; and after its removal hence, at the
time of judgment, it is delivered over to eternal punishment; and
if any one be without grief in regard to the wounds given by the
devil, his danger becomes the greater for his insensibility. For
whoever is not pained by the first wound, will readily receive a
second, and after that a third. For the unclean spirit will not
cease assaulting to the last breath, whenever he finds a soul
supine and indifferent to his first wounds; and if thou wouldest
inquire into the method of attack, thou wouldest find this much
more severe and varied. For no one ever knew so many forms of craft
and deceit as that unclean spirit. By this indeed, he has acquired
the greater part of his power, nor can any one have so implacable a
hatred against his worst enemies as the evil one against the human
race. And if any one inquire into the vehemence with which he
fights, here again it would be ludicrous to bring men into
comparison with him. But if any one choose out the fiercest and
most savage of beasts, and is minded to set their fury against his,
he will find that they were meek and quiet in comparison, such rage
does he breathe forth when he attacks our souls; and the period of
the war<pb n="83" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_83.html" id="iv.viii-Page_83" />fare indeed in the
former case is brief, and in this brief space there are respites;
for the approach of the night and the fatigue of slaughter,
meal-times also, and many other things, afford a respite to the
soldier, so that he can doff his armor and breathe a little, and
refresh himself with food and drink, and in many other ways recover
his former strength. But in the case of the evil one it is not
possible ever to lay aside one’s armor, it is not possible even
to take sleep, for one who would remain always unscathed. For one
of two things must be: either to fall and perish unarmed, or to
stand equipped and ever watchful. For he ever stands with his own
battle array, watching for our indolence, and laboring more
zealously for our destruction, than we for our salvation.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.viii-p47">And that he is not seen by us, and suddenly assails
us, which things are a source of countless evils to those who are
not always on the watch, proves this kind of war to be harder than
the other. Couldest thou wish us, then, in such a case to command
the soldiers of Christ? yea, this were to command them for the
devil’s service, for whenever he who ought to marshal and order
others is the most inexperienced and feeble of all men, by
betraying through this inexperience those who have been entrusted
to his charge, he commands them in the devil’s interests rather
than in Christ’s.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.viii-p48">But why dost thou sigh? why weep? For my ease does

obtain such assurance from this ministry as to receive me also, if
I am in danger at the last day, into thine everlasting
tabernacle.</p>

<p class="c9" id="v.ii-p2">These two letters, which are the earliest of
Chrysostom’s extant works, are addressed to a friend who had been
a member of the little ascetic brotherhood which Chrysostom and
Basil formed, soon after they had abandoned secular life, as
described in the first book of the Treatise on the Priesthood.
Theodore, like Maximus, afterwards Bishop of Isaurian Seleucia, who
was another member of the same fraternity, had been a fellow
student with Chrysostom and Basil in the school of Libanius,<note place="end" n="220" id="v.ii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii-p3"> See introduction to the “Treatise on the
Priesthood.”</p></note> but was a
few years younger than either of them. The strain upon his powers
of religious devotion had proved too much for him; he had withdrawn
from the ascetic brotherhood, and relapsed for a season into
worldly habits, being fascinated by the beauty of a young lady
named Hermione, whom he was anxious to marry. His fall was regarded
with almost as much sorrow and dismay by his austere friends as if
he had plunged into deadly vice. Prayers were continually offered,
and great efforts made for his restoration, amongst which must be
reckoned the two letters which are here translated. They are the
productions of a youthful enthusiast, and as such allowances must
be made for them; but they abound in passages of great beauty and
power, especially upon the infinite love and forbearance of God, as
encouraging to repentance and withholding from despair and
recklessness into which Theodore seems to have been inclined to
sink. The appeal of Chrysostom, combined with the efforts of his
other friends, was not in vain. Theodore once more renounced the
world and his matrimonial intentions, and retired into the
seclusion of the fraternity. In A.D. 383, when he was about
thirty-three years of age, he was ordained priest, and in 392 he
became Bishop of Mopsuestia, where he died in A.D. 428 at the age
of seventy-eight. Chrysostom seems to have retained his affection
to him to the last, and during his own exile at Cucusus, A.D.
404–7, wrote a letter to him which is full of expressions of
fervent admiration and regard. He was a most voluminous writer, and
may be regarded as the ablest representative of the school of
Biblical interpretation founded by Diodorus of Tarsus, under whom
he had studied, together with Chrysostom and Basil. A fierce
controversy raged during the fifth and sixth centuries respecting
the orthodoxy of some of his writings which some accused of
preparing the way for Nestorianism. When this had died down his
name was comparatively forgotten, and it is only in modern times
that his great merits as a commentator, who boldly applied the
historical and grammatical methods of examination to the books of
Holy Scripture, have been fully recognized.</p>

<p class="c10" id="v.ii-p4">Tillemont was of opinion that of the two letters of
Chrysostom the second only was addressed to Theodore, who was
afterwards Bishop of Mopsuestia. Montfaucon, however, Dupin, and
Savile, maintain that both were addressed to him, and their view is
confirmed by the fact that Leontius of Byzantium (in Nest. et.
Eutych. lib. iii. c. 7) and Isidore of Seville (de Script. <scripRef passage="Eccl. c. 6" id="v.ii-p4.1" parsed="|Eccl|6|0|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Eccl.6">Eccl. c.

Mopsuestia.</p>

these words now, yea much more than for the prophet in his time.
For although I am not about to mourn over many cities, or whole
nations, yet shall I mourn over a soul which is of equal value with
many such nations, yea even more precious. For if one man who does
the will of God is better than ten thousand transgressors, then
thou wast formerly better than ten thousand Jews. Wherefore no one
would now blame me if I were to compose more lamentations than
those which are contained in the prophet, and to utter complaints
yet more vehement. For it is not the overthrow of a city which I
mourn, nor the captivity of wicked men, but the desolation of a
sacred soul, the destruction and effacement of a Christ-bearing
temple.<note place="end" n="222" id="v.iii-p5.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p6"> See <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 3.16-17; 6.19" id="v.iii-p6.1" parsed="|1Cor|3|16|3|17;|1Cor|6|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.3.16-1Cor.3.17 Bible:1Cor.6.19">1 Cor. iii. 16, 17; and vi. 19</scripRef>. Ignatius the martyr had the

God-bearer,” which was probably given at the time of his
conversion, or of baptism, to remind him continually of his
Christian privileges and duties. See note, p. 73.</p></note> For would
not any one who knew in the days of its glory that well-ordered
mind of thine which the devil has now set on fire, groan, imitating
the lamentation of the prophet; when he hears that barbarian hands
have defiled the holy of holies, and have set fire to all things
and burned them up, the cherubim, the ark, the mercy seat, the
tables of stone, the golden pot? For this calamity is bitterer, yea
bitterer than that, in proportion as the pledges deposited in thy
soul were far more precious than those. This temple is holier than
that; for it glistened not with gold and silver, but with the grace
of the Spirit, and in place of the ark and the cherubim, it had
Christ, and His Father, and the Paraclete seated within. But now
all is changed, and the temple is desolate, and bare of its former
beauty and comeliness, unadorned with its divine and unspeakable
adornments, destitute of all security and protection; it has
neither door nor bolt, and is laid open to all manner of
soul-destroying and shameful thoughts; and if the thought of
arrogance or fornication, or avarice, or any more accursed than
these, wish to enter in there is no one to hinder them; whereas
formerly, even as the Heaven is inaccessible to all these, so also
was the purity of thy soul. Now perhaps I shall seem to say what is
incredible to some who now witness thy desolation and overthrow;
for on this account I wail and mourn, and shall not cease doing so,
until I see thee again established in thy former lustre. For
although this seems to be impossible to men, yet to God all things
are possible. For it is He “who raiseth the poor from the earth,
and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set him with the
princes, even with the princes of his people.” It is He “who
makes the barren woman to dwell at home, a mother rejoicing over
her children.”<note place="end" n="223" id="v.iii-p6.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p7"> <scripRef passage="Ps. cxiii. 7-9" id="v.iii-p7.1" parsed="|Ps|13|7|13|9" osisRef="Bible:Ps.13.7-Ps.13.9">Ps. cxiii.
7–9</scripRef>.</p></note> Do not then
despair of the most perfect change. For if the devil had such great
power as to cast thee down from that pinnacle and height of virtue
into the extremity of evil doing, much more will God be able to
draw thee up again to thy former confidence; and not only indeed to
make you what you were before, but even much happier. Only be not
downcast, nor fling away good hopes, nor fall into the condition of
the ungodly. For it is not the multitude of sins which is wont to
plunge men into despair, but impiety of soul. Therefore Solomon did
not make the unqualified statement “<i>every one</i> who has
entered into the den of the wicked, despiseth;” but only “he
who is ungodly.”<note place="end" n="224" id="v.iii-p7.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p8"> <scripRef passage="Prov. xviii. 3" id="v.iii-p8.1" parsed="|Prov|18|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Prov.18.3">Prov.

<pb n="92" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_92.html" id="v.iii-Page_92" />it is such persons only who are affected in
this way when they have entered the den of the wicked. And this it
is which does not suffer them to look up, and re-ascend to the
position from which they fell. For this accursed thought pressing
down like some yoke upon the neck of the soul, and so forcing it to
stoop, hinders it from looking up to the Master. Now it is the part
of a brave and excellent man to break this yoke in pieces, to shake
off the tormentor fastened upon him; and to utter the words of the
prophet, “As the eyes of a maiden look unto the hands of her
mistress, even so our eyes look unto the Lord our God until He have
mercy upon us. Have pity upon us, O Lord, have pity upon us, for we
have been utterly filled with contempt.”<note place="end" n="225" id="v.iii-p8.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p9"> <scripRef passage="Ps. cxxiii. 2, 3" id="v.iii-p9.1" parsed="|Ps|23|2|23|3" osisRef="Bible:Ps.23.2-Ps.23.3">Ps.
cxxiii. 2, 3</scripRef>.</p></note> Truly divine are these precepts,
and decrees of the highest form of spiritual wisdom. We have been
filled, it is said, with contempt, and have undergone countless
distresses; nevertheless we shall not desist from looking up to
God, neither shall we cease praying to him until He has received
our petition. For this is the mark of a noble soul, not to be cast
down, nor be dismayed at the multitude of the calamities which
oppress it, nor to withdraw, after praying many times without
success, but to persevere, until He have mercy upon us, even as the
blessed David saith.</p>

<p class="c10" id="v.iii-p10">2. For the reason why the devil plunges us
into thoughts of despair is that he may cut off the hope which is
towards God, the safe anchor, the foundation of our life, the guide
of the way which leads to heaven, the salvation of perishing souls.
“For by hope” it is said, “we are saved.”<note place="end" n="226" id="v.iii-p10.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p11"> <scripRef passage="Rom. viii. 24" id="v.iii-p11.1" parsed="|Rom|8|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.8.24">Rom. viii.
24</scripRef>.</p></note> For this assuredly it is which,
like some strong cord suspended from the heavens, supports our
souls, gradually drawing towards that world on high those who cling
firmly to it, and lifting them above the tempest of the evils of
this life. If any one then becomes enervated, and lets go this
sacred anchor, straightway he falls down, and is suffocated, having
entered into the abyss of wickedness. And the Evil One knowing
this, when he perceives that we are ourselves oppressed by the
consciousness of evil deeds, steps in himself and lays upon us the
additional burden, heavier than lead, of anxiety arising from
despair; and if we accept it, it follows of necessity that we are
forthwith dragged down by the weight, and having been parted from
that cord, descend into the depth of misery where thou thyself art
now, having forsaken the commandments of the meek and lowly Master
and executing all the injunctions of the cruel tyrant, and
implacable enemy of our salvation; having broken in pieces the easy
yoke, and cast away the light burden, and having put on the iron
collar instead of these things, yea, having hung the ponderous
millstone<note place="end" n="227" id="v.iii-p11.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p12"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.iii-p12.1">μύλος ὀνικός</span>,
lit. the mill-stone turned by an ass, as being heavier than the
common hand-mill. So in 
<scripRef passage="Matt. xviii. 6" id="v.iii-p12.2" parsed="|Matt|18|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.18.6">Matt. xviii. 6</scripRef>.</p></note> from thy
neck. Where then canst thou find a footing henceforth when thou art
submerging thy unhappy soul, imposing on thyself this necessity of
continually sinking downwards? Now the woman who had found the one
coin called her neighbors to share her joy; saying, “Rejoice with
me;” but I shall now invoke all friends, both mine and thine, for
the contrary purpose, saying not “Rejoice with me” but “Mourn
with me,” and take up the same strain of mourning, and utter the
same cry of distress with me. For the worst possible loss has
befallen me, not that some given number of talents of gold, or some
large quantity of precious stones have dropped out of my hand, but
that he who was more precious than all these things, who was
sailing over this same sea, this great and broad sea with me, has,
I know not how, slipped overboard, and fallen into the very pit of
destruction.</p>

<p class="c10" id="v.iii-p13">3. Now if any should attempt to divert me from
mourning, I shall reply to them in the words of the prophet, saying
“Let me alone, I will weep bitterly; labour not to comfort
me.”<note place="end" n="228" id="v.iii-p13.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p14"> <scripRef passage="Is. xxii. 4" id="v.iii-p14.1" parsed="|Isa|22|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.22.4">Is. xxii.
4</scripRef>.</p></note> For the
mourning with which I mourn now is not of a kind to subject me to
condemnation for excess in lamentation, but the cause is one for
which even Paul, or Peter, had they been here, would not have been
ashamed to weep and mourn, and reject all kinds of consolation. For
those who bewail that death which is common to all one might
reasonably accuse of much feebleness of spirit; but when in place
of a corpse a dead soul lies before us, pierced with innumerable
wounds, and yet even in its death manifesting its former natural
comeliness, and health, and beauty now extinguished, who can be so
harsh and unsympathetic as to utter words of encouragement in place
of wailing and lamentation? For as in the other world the absence
of mourning is a mark of divine wisdom, so in this world the act of
mourning is a mark of the same. He who had already mounted to the
sky, who was laughing to scorn the vanity of this life, who
regarded bodily beauty no more than if it had been in forms of
stone, who despised gold as it had been mud, and every kind of
luxury as mire, even he, having been suddenly overwhelmed with the
feverish longing of a preposterous passion, has ruined his health,
and manly strength, and the bloom of his youth, and <pb n="93" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_93.html" id="v.iii-Page_93" />become a slave of pleasure.
Shall we not weep then, I pray you, for such a man and bewail him,
until we have got him back again? And where do these things concern
the human soul? It is not possible indeed to discover in this world
the means of release from the death of the body, and yet even this
does not stay the mourners from lamenting; but only in this world
is it possible to bring to naught the death of the soul. “For in
Hades” we read, “who will confess thee?”<note place="end" n="229" id="v.iii-p14.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p15"> <scripRef passage="Ps. vi. 5" id="v.iii-p15.1" parsed="|Ps|6|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.6.5">Ps. vi.
5</scripRef>.</p></note> Is it not then the height of
stupidity that they who mourn the death of the body should do this
so earnestly, although they know that they will not raise the dead
man to life by their lamentation; but that we should not manifest
anything of the kind, and this when we know that often there is
hope of conducting the lost soul back to its former life? For many
both now and in the days of our forefathers, having been perverted
from the right position, and fallen headlong out of the straight
path, have been so completely restored as to eclipse their former
deeds by the latter, and to receive the prize, and be wreathed with
the garland of victory, and be proclaimed among the conquerors, and
be numbered in the company of the saints. For as long as any one
stands in the furnace of pleasures, even if he has countless
examples of this kind before him, the thing seems to him to be
impossible; but if he once gets a short start upon the way out from
thence, by continually advancing he leaves the fiercer part of the
fire behind him and will see the parts which are in front of him,
and before his footsteps full of dew and much refreshment; only let
us not despair or grow weary of the return; for he who is so
affected, even if he has acquired boundless power and zeal, has
acquired it to no purpose. For when he has once shut the door of
repentance against himself, and has blocked the entrance into the
race-course, how will he be able while he abides outside to
accomplish any good thing, either small or great? On this account
the Evil One uses all kinds of devices in order to plant in us this
thought (of despair); for (if he succeeds) he will no longer have
to sweat and toil in contending with us; how should he, when we are
prostrate and fallen, and unwilling to resist him? For he who has
been able to slip out of this chain, will recover his own strength
and will not cease struggling against the devil to his last gasp,
and even if he had countless other falls, he will get up again, and
will smite his enemy; but he who is in bondage to the cogitations
of despair, and has unstrung his own strength, how will he be able
to prevail, and to resist, having on the contrary taken to
flight?</p>

<p class="c10" id="v.iii-p16">4. And speak not to me of those who have committed
small sins, but suppose the case of one who is filled full of all
wickedness, and let him practice everything which excludes him from
the kingdom, and let us suppose that this man is not one of those
who were unbelievers from the beginning, but formerly belonged to
the believers, and such as were well pleasing to God, but
afterwards has become a fornicator, adulterer, effeminate, a thief,
a drunkard, a sodomite, a reviler, and everything else of this
kind; I will not approve even of this man despairing of himself,
although he may have gone on to extreme old age in the practice of
this great and unspeakable wickedness. For if the wrath of God were
a passion, one might well despair as being unable to quench the
flame which he had kindled by so many evil doings; but since the
Divine nature is passionless, even if He punishes, even if He takes
vengeance, he does this not with wrath, but with tender care, and
much loving-kindness; wherefore it behoves us to be of much good
courage, and to trust in the power of repentance. For even those
who have sinned against Him He is not wont to visit with punishment
for His own sake; for no harm can traverse that divine nature; but
He acts with a view to our advantage, and to prevent our
perverseness becoming worse by our making a practice of despising
and neglecting Him. For even as one who places himself outside the
light inflicts no loss on the light, but the greatest upon himself
being shut up in darkness; even so he who has become accustomed to
despise that almighty power, does no injury to the power, but
inflicts the greatest possible injury upon himself. And for this
reason God threatens us with punishments, and often inflicts them,
not as avenging Himself, but by way of attracting us to Himself.
For a physician also is not distressed or vexed at the insults of
those who are out of their minds, but yet does and contrives
everything for the purpose of stopping those who do such unseemly
acts, not looking to his own interests but to their profit; and if
they manifest some small degree of self-control and sobriety he
rejoices and is glad, and applies his remedies much more earnestly,
not as revenging himself upon them for their former conduct, but as
wishing to increase their advantage, and to bring them back to a
purely sound state of health. Even so God when we fall into the
very extremity of madness, says and does everything, not by way of
avenging Himself on account of our former deeds; but because He
wishes to release us from our disorder; and by means of <pb n="94" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_94.html" id="v.iii-Page_94" />right reason it is quite possible to
be convinced of this.</p>

<p class="c10" id="v.iii-p17">5. Now if any one should dispute with us
concerning these things we will confirm them out of the divine
oracles. For who, I ask, became more depraved than the king of the
Babylonians, who after having received such great experience of
God’s power as to make obeisance to His prophet, and command
offerings and incense to be sacrificed to Him was again carried
away to his former pride, and cast bound into the furnace those who
did not honour himself before God. Nevertheless this man who was so
cruel and impious, and rather a beast than a human being, God
invited to repentance, and granted him several opportunities of
conversion, first of all the miracle which took place in the
furnace, and after that the vision which the king saw but which
Daniel interpreted, a vision sufficient to bend even a heart of
stone; and in addition to these things after the exhortation
derived from events the prophet also himself advised him, saying
“Therefore, O king, let my counsel please thee, and redeem thy
sins by alms, and thy iniquities by showing mercy to the poor; it
may be that long suffering will be shown to thy offence.”<note place="end" n="230" id="v.iii-p17.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p18"> <scripRef passage="Dan. iv. 27" id="v.iii-p18.1" parsed="|Dan|4|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Dan.4.27">Dan. iv.
27</scripRef>.</p></note> What sayest
thou O wise and blessed man? After so great a fall is there again a
way of return? and after so great a disease is health possible? and
after so great a madness is there again a hope of soundness of
mind? The king has deprived himself beforehand of all hope, first
of all by having ignored Him who created him; and conducted him to
this honour, although he had many evidences of His power and
forethought to recount which occurred both in his own case and in
the case of his forefathers; but after this again when he had
received distinct tokens of God’s wisdom and foreknowledge, and
had seen magic, and astronomy and the theatre of the whole satanic
system of jugglery overthrown, he exhibited deeds yet worse than
the former. For things which the wise magi, the Gazarenes, could
not explain, but confessed that they were beyond human nature,
these a captive youth having caused to be solved for him, so moved
him by that miracle that he not only himself believed, but also
became to the whole world a clear herald and teacher of this
doctrine.<note place="end" n="231" id="v.iii-p18.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p19"> <scripRef passage="Dan. ii" id="v.iii-p19.1" parsed="|Dan|2|0|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Dan.2">Dan.
ii</scripRef>.</p></note> Wherefore if
even before having received such a token it was unpardonable in him
to ignore God, much more so was it after that miracle, and his
confession, and the teaching which was extended to others. For if
he had not honestly believed that He was the only true God he would
not have shown such honour to His servant, or have laid down such
laws for others. But yet after making this kind of confession, he
again lapsed into idolatry, and he who once fell on his face and
made obeisance to the servant of God, broke out into such a pitch
of madness, as to cast into the furnace the servants of God who did
not make obeisance to himself. What then? did God visit the
apostate, as he deserved to be visited? No! He supplied him with
greater tokens of His own power, drawing him back again after so
great a display of arrogance to his former condition; and, what is
yet more wonderful, that owing to the abundance of the miracles he
might not again disbelieve what was done, the subject upon which He
wrought the sign was none other than the furnace which the king
himself kindled for the children whom he bound and cast therein.
Even to extinguish the flame would have been a wonderful and
strange thing; but the benign Deity in order to inspire him with
greater fear, and increase his dismay, and undo all his hardness of
heart, did what was greater and stranger than this. For, permitting
the furnace to be kindled to as high a pitch as he desired, He then
exhibited his own peculiar power, not by putting down the devices
of his enemies, but by frustrating them when they were set on foot.
And, to prevent any one who saw them survive the flame from
supposing that it was a vision, He suffered those who cast them in
to be burned, thus proving that the thing seen was really fire; for
otherwise it would not have devoured naphtha and tow, and fagots
and such a large number of bodies; but nothing is stronger than His
command; but the nature of all existing things obeys Him who
brought them into being out of nothing; which was just what He
manifested at that time; for the flame having received perishable
bodies, held aloof from them as if they had been imperishable, and
restored in safety, with the addition of much lustre, the deposit
entrusted to it. For like kings from some royal court, even so did
those children come forth from the furnace, no one having the
patience to look any longer at the king, but all transferring their
eyes from him to the strange spectacle, and neither the diadem nor
the purple robe, nor any other feature of royal pomp, attracted the
multitudes of unbelievers so much as the sight of those faithful
ones, who tarried long in the fire, and then came out of it as men
might have done who had undergone this in a dream. For the most
fragile of all our features, I mean the hair, prevailed more
mightily than adamant against the all-devouring flame. And the fact
that when they were cast into the midst of the fire they suffered
no harm was not the only 
<pb n="95" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_95.html" id="v.iii-Page_95" />wonder, but the further fact that they were
speaking the whole time. Now all who have witnessed persons burning
are aware, that if they keep their lips fast closed, they can hold
out for a short time at least against the conflagration; but if any
one chances to open his mouth, the soul instantly takes its flight
from the body. Nevertheless after such great miracles had taken
place, and all who were present and beheld were amazed, and those
who were absent had been informed of the fact by means of letters,
the king who instructed others remained himself without amendment,
and went back again to his former wickedness. And yet even then God
did not punish him, but was still long-suffering, counselling him
both by means of visions and by His prophet. But when he was not
made anywise better by any of these things, then at last God
inflicted punishment upon him, not by way of avenging himself on
account of his former deeds, but as cutting off the occasion of
future evils, and checking the advance of wickedness, and He did
not inflict even this permanently, but after having chastised him
for a few years, He restored him again to his former honour,
without having suffered any loss from his punishment, but on the
contrary having gained the greatest possible good; a firm hold upon
faith in God, and repentance on account of his former misdeeds.<note place="end" n="232" id="v.iii-p19.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p20"> <scripRef passage="Dan. iv" id="v.iii-p20.1" parsed="|Dan|4|0|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Dan.4">Dan.

<p class="c10" id="v.iii-p21">6. For such is the loving-kindness of God; He
never turns his face away from a sincere repentance, but if any one
has pushed on to the very extremity of wickedness, and chooses to
return thence towards the path of virtue, God accepts and welcomes,
and does everything so as to restore him to his former position.
And He does what is yet more merciful; for even should any one not
manifest complete repentance, he does not pass by one which is
small and insignificant, but assigns a great reward even to this;
which is evident from what Esaias the prophet says concerning the
people of the Jews, speaking on this wise: “On account of his sin
I put him to pain for a little while, and smote him, and turned my
face away from him, and he was pained, and walked sorrowfully, and
then I healed him, and comforted him.”<note place="end" n="233" id="v.iii-p21.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p22"> <scripRef passage="Isa. lvii. 17, 18" id="v.iii-p22.1" parsed="|Isa|57|17|57|18" osisRef="Bible:Isa.57.17-Isa.57.18">Isa. lvii.

words “in his ways.” I beheld his ways and healed him,
etc.</p></note> And we might cite as another
witness that most ungodly king, who was given over to sin by the
influence of his wife: yet when he only sorrowed, and put on
sackcloth, and condemned his offences, he so won for himself the
mercy of God, as to be released from all the evils which were
impending over him. For God said to Elias “Seest thou how Ahab is
pricked in the heart before my face? I will not bring the evil upon
him in his own days, because he hath wept before me.”<note place="end" n="234" id="v.iii-p22.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p23"> <scripRef passage="1 Kings xxi. 29" id="v.iii-p23.1" parsed="|1Kgs|21|29|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Kgs.21.29">1 Kings

this again, Manasses, having exceeded all in fury and tyranny, and
having subverted the legal form of worship, and shut up the temple,
and caused the deceit of idolatry to flourish, and having become
more ungodly than all who were before him, when he afterwards
repented, was ranked amongst the friends of God. Now if, looking to
the magnitude of his own iniquities, he had despaired of
restoration and repentance, he would have missed all which he
afterwards obtained: but as it was, looking to the boundlessness of
God’s tender mercy instead of the enormity of his transgressions,
and having broken in sunder the bonds of the devil, he rose up and
contended with him, and finished the good course.<note place="end" n="235" id="v.iii-p23.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p24"> <scripRef passage="2 Chron. xxxiii. 10-19" id="v.iii-p24.1" parsed="|2Chr|33|10|33|19" osisRef="Bible:2Chr.33.10-2Chr.33.19">2 Chron.
xxxiii. 10–19</scripRef>.</p></note> And not only by what was done to
these men, but also by the words of the prophet does God destroy
the counsels of despair, speaking on this wise: “To-day, if ye
will hear His voice, harden not your hearts, as in the
provocation.”<note place="end" n="236" id="v.iii-p24.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p25"> <scripRef passage="Ps. xcv. 9" id="v.iii-p25.1" parsed="|Ps|95|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.95.9">Ps. xcv.

expression “to-day,” may be uttered at every time of life, even
on the verge of old age, if you desire it: for repentance is judged
not by quantity of time, but by disposition of the soul. For the
Ninevites did not need many days to blot out their sin, but the
short space of one day availed to efface all their iniquity: and
the robber also did not take a long time to effect his entrance
into Paradise, but in such a brief moment as one might occupy in
uttering a single word, did he wash off all the sins which he had
committed in his whole life, and received the prize bestowed by the
divine approval even before the Apostles. And we also see the
martyrs obtain glorious crowns for themselves in the course, not of
many years, but of a few days, and often in a single day
only.</p>

<p class="c10" id="v.iii-p26">7. Wherefore we have need of zeal in every
direction, and much preparation of mind: and if we so order our
conscience as to hate our former wickedness, and choose the
contrary path with as much energy as God desires and commands, we
shall not have anything less on account of the short space of time:
many at least who were last have far outstripped those who were
first. For to have fallen is not a grievous thing, but to remain
prostrate after falling, and not to get up again; and, playing the
coward and the sluggard, to conceal feebleness of moral purpose
under the reasoning of despair. To whom also the prophet spoke in
perplexity saying “Doth he who falleth not rise <pb n="96" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_96.html" id="v.iii-Page_96" />up, or he who turneth away not
turn back?”<note place="end" n="237" id="v.iii-p26.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p27"> <scripRef passage="Jer. viii. 4" id="v.iii-p27.1" parsed="|Jer|8|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Jer.8.4">Jer. viii.

inquire of me for instances of persons who have fallen away after
having believed, all these things have been said with reference to
such persons, for he who has fallen belonged formerly to those who
were standing, not to those who were prostrate; for how should one
in that condition fall? But other things also shall be said, partly
by means of parables, partly by plainer deeds and words. Now that
sheep which had got separated from the ninety and nine,<note place="end" n="238" id="v.iii-p27.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p28"> <scripRef passage="Luke xv. 4, 5" id="v.iii-p28.1" parsed="|Luke|15|4|15|5" osisRef="Bible:Luke.15.4-Luke.15.5">Luke xv.
4, 5</scripRef>.</p></note> and then was
brought back again, represents to us nothing else than the fall and
return of the faithful; for it was a sheep not of some alien flock,
but belonging to the same number as the rest, and was formerly
pastured by the same shepherd, and it strayed on no common
straying, but wandered away to the mountains and in valleys, that
is to say some long journey, far distant from the right path. Did
he then suffer it to stray? By no means, but brought it back
neither driving it, nor beating it, but taking it upon his
shoulders. For as the best physicians bring back those who are far
gone in sickness with careful treatment to a state of health, not
only treating them according to the laws of the medical art, but
sometimes also giving them gratification: even so God conducts to
virtue those who are much depraved, not with great severity, but
gently and gradually, and supporting them on every side, so that
the separation may not become greater, nor the error more
prolonged. And the same truth is implied in the parable of the
prodigal son as well as in this. For he also was no stranger, but a
son, and a brother of the child who had been well pleasing to the
father, and he plunged into no ordinary vice, but went to the very
extremity, so to say, of evil, he the rich and free and well-bred
son being reduced to a more miserable condition than that of
household slaves, strangers, and hirelings. Nevertheless he
returned again to his original condition, and had his former honour
restored to him. But if he had despaired of his life, and, dejected
by what had befallen him, had remained in the foreign land, he
would not have obtained what he did obtain, but would have been
consumed with hunger, and so have undergone the most pitiable
death: but since he repented, and did not despair, he was restored,
even after such great corruption, to the same splendour as before,
and was arrayed in the most beautiful robe, and enjoyed greater
honours than his brother who had not fallen. For “these many
years,” saith he “do I serve thee, neither transgressed I thy
commandment at any time, and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I
might make merry with my friends; but when this thy son is come who
hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the
fatted calf.”<note place="end" n="239" id="v.iii-p28.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p29"> <scripRef passage="Luke xv. 29, 30" id="v.iii-p29.1" parsed="|Luke|15|29|15|30" osisRef="Bible:Luke.15.29-Luke.15.30">Luke xv.

the power of repentance.</p>

<p class="c10" id="v.iii-p30">8. Having then such great examples, let us not
continue in evil, nor despair of reconciliation, but let us say
also ourselves “I will go to my Father,” and let us draw nigh
to God. For He Himself never turns away from us, but it is we who
put ourselves far off: for “I am a God” we read “at hand and
not a God afar off.”<note place="end" n="240" id="v.iii-p30.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p31"> <scripRef passage="Jer. xxiii. 23" id="v.iii-p31.1" parsed="|Jer|23|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Jer.23.23">Jer.

which puts us far from God, let us remove this obnoxious barrier,
which prevents any near approach being made.</p>

<p class="c10" id="v.iii-p33">But now hear how this has actually occurred in
real instances. Amongst the Corinthians some man of mark committed
a sin such as was not named even among the Gentiles. This man was a
believer and belonged to the household of Christ; and some say that
he was actually a member of the priesthood. What then? Did Paul cut
him off from the communion of those who were in the way of
salvation. By no means: for he himself it is who rebukes the
Corinthians countless times, backwards and forwards, because they
did not bring the man to a state of repentance: but, desiring to
prove to us that there is no sin which cannot be healed, he said
again concerning the man who had transgressed more grievously than
the Gentiles: “Deliver such an one to Satan for destruction of
the flesh that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus
Christ.”<note place="end" n="242" id="v.iii-p33.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p34"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. v. 5" id="v.iii-p34.1" parsed="|1Cor|5|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.5.5">1 Cor. v.
5</scripRef>.</p></note> Now this was
prior to repentance: but after he had repented “Sufficient,”
said he, “for such an one is this punishment which was inflicted
by the many<note place="end" n="243" id="v.iii-p34.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p35"> <scripRef passage="2 Cor. ii. 6" id="v.iii-p35.1" parsed="|2Cor|2|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.2.6">2 Cor. ii.

charged them by a letter to console the man again, and to welcome
his repentance, so that he should not be got the better of by
Satan. Moreover when the whole Galatian people fell after having
believed, and wrought miracles, and endured many trials for the
sake of their faith in Christ he sets them up again. For that they
had done miracles he testified when he said: “He therefore that
supplieth to you the Spirit and worketh miracles among you:”<note place="end" n="244" id="v.iii-p35.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p36"> <scripRef passage="Gal. iii. 5" id="v.iii-p36.1" parsed="|Gal|3|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gal.3.5">Gal. iii.

they endured many contests for the sake of the faith, he also
testified when he says: 
<pb n="97" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_97.html" id="v.iii-Page_97" />“Have ye suffered so many things in vain

an advance they committed sin sufficient to estrange them from
Christ concerning which he declares saying: “Behold, I Paul tell
you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ will profit you nothing:”
and again “ye who would be justified by the law are fallen away
from grace:”<note place="end" n="246" id="v.iii-p37.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p38"> <scripRef passage="Gal. v. 2, 4" id="v.iii-p38.1" parsed="|Gal|5|2|0|0;|Gal|5|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gal.5.2 Bible:Gal.5.4">Gal. v. 2,

after so great a lapse he welcomes them saying “my little

you<note place="end" n="247" id="v.iii-p38.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p39"> <scripRef passage="Gal. iv. 19" id="v.iii-p39.1" parsed="|Gal|4|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gal.4.19">Gal. iv.

that after extreme perversion it is possible for Christ to be
formed again in us: for He doth not desire the death of a sinner,
but rather that he should be convened and live.</p>

<p class="c10" id="v.iii-p40">9. Let us then turn to Him, my beloved friend,
and execute the will of God. For He created us and brought us into
being, that He might make us partakers of eternal blessings, that
He might offer us the kingdom of Heaven, not that He might cast us
into Hell and deliver us to the fire; for this was made not for us,
but for the devil: but for us the kingdom has been destined and
made ready of old time. And by way of indicating both these truths
He saith to those on the right hand, “Come ye blessed of my
Father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of
the world:” but to those on the left “Depart from me, ye
cursed, into fire everlasting prepared” (he no longer says “for
you” but) “for the devil and his angels.”<note place="end" n="248" id="v.iii-p40.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p41"> <scripRef passage="Matt. xxv. 34" id="v.iii-p41.1" parsed="|Matt|25|34|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.25.34">Matt. xxv.
34</scripRef>.</p></note> Thus hell has not been made for us
but for him and his angels: but the kingdom has been prepared for
us before the foundation of the world. Let us not then make
ourselves unworthy of entrance into the bride-chamber: for as long
as we are in this world, even if we commit countless sins it is
possible to wash them all away by manifesting repentance for our
offences: but when once we have departed to the other world, even
if we display the most earnest repentance it will be of no avail,
not even if we gnash our teeth, beat our breasts, and utter
innumerable calls for succour, no one with the tip of his finger
will apply a drop to our burning bodies, but we shall only hear
those words which the rich man heard in the parable “Between us
and you a great gulf has been fixed.”<note place="end" n="249" id="v.iii-p41.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p42"> <scripRef passage="Luke xvi. 26" id="v.iii-p42.1" parsed="|Luke|16|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.16.26">Luke xvi.
26</scripRef>.</p></note> Let us then, I beseech you, recover
our senses here and let us recognize our Master as He ought to be
recognized. For only when we are in Hades should we abandon the
hope derived from repentance: for there only is this remedy weak
and unprofitable: but while we are here even if it is applied in
old age itself it exhibits much strength. Wherefore also the devil
sets everything in motion in order to root in us the reasoning
which comes of despair: for he knows that if we repent even a
little we shall not do this without some reward. But just as he who
gives a cup of cold water has his recompense reserved for him, so
also the man who has repented of the evils which he has done, even
if he cannot exhibit the repentance which his offences deserve,
will have a commensurate reward. For not a single item of good,
however small it may be, will be overlooked by the righteous judge.
For if He makes such an exact scrutiny of our sins, as to require
punishment for both our words and thoughts, much more will our good
deeds, whether they be great or small, be reckoned to our credit at
that day. Wherefore, even if thou art not able to return again to
the most exact state of discipline, yet if thou withdraw thyself in
a slight degree at least from thy present disorder and excess, even
this will not be impossible: only set thyself to the task at once,
and open the entrance into the place of contest; but as long as
thou tarriest outside this naturally seems difficult and
impracticable to thee. For before making the trial even if things
are easy and manageable they are wont to present an appearance of
much difficulty to us: but when we are actually engaged in the
trial, and making the venture the greater part of our distress is
removed, and confidence taking the place of tremor and despair
lessens the fear and increases the facility of operation, and makes
our good hopes stronger. For this reason also the wicked one
dragged Judas out of this world lest he should make a fair
beginning, and so return by means of repentance to the point from
which he fell. For although it may seem a strange thing to say, I
will not admit even that sin to be too great for the succour which
is brought to us from repentance. Wherefore I pray and beseech you
to banish all this Satanic mode of thinking from your soul, and to
return to this state of salvation. For if indeed I were commanding
you to ascend to your former altitude all at once, you would
naturally complain of there being much difficulty in doing this:
but if all which I now ask you to do is to get up and return thence
in the opposite direction, why do you hesitate, and shrink, and
make a retrograde movement? Have you not seen those who have died
in the midst of luxury and drunkenness, and sport and all the other
folly of this life? Where are they now who used to strut through
the market place with much pomp, and a crowd of attendants? who
were clothed in silk and redolent with perfumes, and kept a table
for their parasites, and were in constant attendance at the
theatre? What has now become of all that 
<pb n="98" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_98.html" id="v.iii-Page_98" />parade of theirs? It is all gone;—the costly
splendour of their banquets, the throng of musicians, the
attentions of flatterers, the loud laughter, the relaxation of
spirit, the enervation of mind, the voluptuous, abandoned,
extravagant manner of life—it has all come to an end. Where now
have all these things taken their flight? What has become of the
body which enjoyed so much attention, and cleanliness. Go thy way
to the coffin, behold the dust, the ashes, the worms, behold the
loathsomeness of the place, and groan bitterly. And would that the
penalty were limited to the ashes! but now transfer thy thought
from the coffin and these worms to that undying worm, to the fire
unquenchable, to the gnashing of teeth, to the outer darkness, to
affliction and straitness, to the parable of Lazarus and the rich
man, who although the owner of so much wealth, and clothed in
purple could not become the owner of even a drop of water; and this
when he was placed in a condition of such great necessity. The
things of this world are in their nature no-wise better than
dreams. For just as those who work in the mines or suffer some
other kind of punishment more severe than this, when they have
fallen asleep owing to their many weary toils and the extreme
bitterness of their life, and in their dreams see themselves living
in luxury and prosperity, are in no wise grateful to their dreams
after they have awaked, even so that rich man having become rich in
this present life, as it were in a dream, after his departure hence
was punished with that bitter punishment. Consider these things,
and having contrasted that fire with the conflagration of desires
which now possesses thee, release thyself from the furnace. For he
who has thoroughly quenched this furnace here, will have no
experience of that in the other world: but if a man does not get
the better of this furnace here, the other will lay hold of him
more vehemently when he has departed hence. How long a time dost
thou wish the enjoyment of the present life to be extended? For I
do not suppose indeed that more than fifty years remain to thee so
as to reach extreme old age, nor indeed is even this at all assured
to us: for how should they who cannot be confident about living
even to the evening rely upon so many years as these? And not only
is this uncertain, but there is the uncertainty also of a change in
our affairs, for often when life has been extended for a long
period, the conditions of luxury have not been extended with it,
but have come, and at the same time hastily departed. However, if
you like, let it be granted for argument’s sake, that you will
live so many years, and will not sustain any reverse of fortune
what is this compared with the endless ages, and those bitter deed
and intolerable punishments? For here indeed both good and evil
things have an end, and that very speedily: but there, both are
coextensive with immortal ages, and in their quality differ
unspeakably from the things which now are.</p>

<p class="c10" id="v.iii-p43">10. For when you hear of fire, do not suppose the
fire in that world to be like this: for fire in this world burns up
and makes away with anything which it takes hold of; but that fire
is continually burning those who have once been seized by it, and
never ceases: therefore also is it called unquenchable. For those
also who have sinned must put on immortality, not for honour, but
to have a constant supply of material for that punishment to work
upon; and how terrible this is, speech could never depict, but from
the experience of little things it is possible to form some slight
notion of these great ones. For if you should ever be in a bath
which has been heated more than it ought to be, think then, I pray
you, on the fire of hell: or again if you are ever inflamed by some
severe fever transfer your thoughts to that flame, and then you
will be able clearly to discern the difference. For if a bath and a
fever so afflict and distress us, what will our condition be when
we have fallen into that river of fire which winds in front of the
terrible judgment-seat. Then we shall gnash our teeth under the
suffering of our labours and intolerable pains: but there will be
no one to succour us: yea we shall groan mightily, as the flame is
applied more severely to us, but we shall see no one save those who
are being punished with us, and great desolation. And how should
any one describe the terrors arising to our souls from the
darkness? for just as that fire has no consuming power so neither
has it any power of giving light: for otherwise there would not be
darkness. The dismay produced in us then by this, and the trembling
and the great astonishment can be sufficiently realized in that day
only. For in that world many and various kinds of torment and
torrents of punishment are poured in upon the soul from every side.
And if any one should ask, “and how can the soul bear up against
such a multitude of punishments and continue being chastised
through interminable ages,” let him consider what happens in this
world, how many have often borne up against a long and severe
disease. And if they have died, this has happened not because the
soul was consumed but because the body was exhausted, so that had
the latter not broken down, the soul would not have ceased being
tormented. When then we have received an incorruptible and
inconsumable body there is nothing to prevent the punishment being
in<pb n="99" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_99.html" id="v.iii-Page_99" />definitely extended.
For here indeed it is impossible that the two things should
coexist. I mean severity of punishment and permanence of being, but
the one contends with the other, because the nature of the body is
perishable and cannot bear the concurrence of both: but when the
imperishable state has supervened, there would be an end of this
strife, and both these terrible things will keep their hold upon us
for infinite time with much force. Let us not then so dispose
ourselves now as if the excessive power of the tortures were
destructive of the soul: for even the body will not be able to
experience this at that time, but will abide together with the
soul, in a state of eternal punishment, and there will not be any
end to look to beyond this. How much luxury then, and how much time
will you weigh in the balance against this punishment and
vengeance? Do you propose a period of a hundred years or twice as
long? and what is this compared with the endless ages? For what the
dream of a single day is in the midst of a whole lifetime, that the
enjoyment of things here is as contrasted with the state of things
to come. Is there then any one who, for the sake of seeing a good
dream, would elect to be perpetually punished? Who is so senseless
as to have recourse to this kind of retribution? For I am not yet
accusing luxury nor revealing now the bitterness which lurks in it:
for the present is not the proper time for these remarks, but when
ye have been able to escape it. For now, entangled as you are by
this passion, you will suspect me of talking nonsense, if I were to
call pleasure bitter: but when by the grace of God you have been
released from the malady then you will know its topics for another
season, what I will say now is just this: Be it so, that luxury is
luxury, and pleasure, pleasure, and that they have nothing in them
painful or disgraceful, what shall we say to the punishment which
is in store for us? and what shall we do then if we have taken our
pleasure now, as it were in a shadow and a figure, but undergo
everlasting torment there in reality, when we might in a short
space of time escape these tortures already mentioned, and enjoy
the good things which are stored up for us? For this also is the
work of the loving-kindness of God, that our struggles are not
protracted to a great length, but that after struggling for a
brief, and tiny twinkling of an eye (for such is present life
compared with the other) we receive crowns of victory for endless
ages. And it will be no small affliction to the souls of those who
are being punished at that time, to reflect, that when they had it
in their power in the few days of this life to make all good, they

power of repentance is great. For not only the evils already
mentioned, but others also far worse than these await us if we are
indolent. These indeed, and some bitterer than these have their
place in hell: but the loss of the good things involves so much
pain, so much affliction and straitness, that even if no other kind
of punishment were appointed for those who sin here, it would of
itself be sufficient to vex us more bitterly than the torments in
hell, and to confound our souls.</p>

other life, so far as it is possible to consider it; for no words
will suffice for an adequate description: but from the things which
are told us, as if by means of certain riddles, let us try and get
some indistinct vision of it. “Pain and sorrow and sighing,” we
read “have fled away.”<note place="end" n="251" id="v.iii-p45.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p46"> <scripRef passage="Isa. xxxv. 10" id="v.iii-p46.1" parsed="|Isa|35|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.35.10">Isa. xxxv.

than this life? It is not possible there to fear poverty and
disease: it is not possible to see any one injuring, or being
injured, provoking, or being provoked, or angry, or envious, or
burning with any outrageous lust, or anxious concerning the supply
of the necessaries of life, or bemoaning himself over the loss of
some dignity and power: for all the tempest of passion in us is
quelled and brought to nought, and all will be in a condition of
peace, and gladness and joy, all things serene and tranquil, all
will be daylight and brightness, and light, not this present light,
but one excelling this in splendour as much as this excels the
brightness of a lamp. For things are not concealed in that world by
night, or by a gathering of clouds: bodies there are not set on
fire and burned: for there is neither night nor evening there, nor
cold nor heat, nor any other variation of seasons: but the
condition is of a different kind, such as they only will know who
have been deemed worthy of it; there is no old age there, nor any
of the evils of old age, but all things relating to decay are
utterly removed, and incorruptible glory reigns in every part. But
greater than all these things is the perpetual enjoyment of
intercourse with Christ in the company of angels, and archangels,
and the higher powers. Behold now the sky, and pass through it in
thought to the region beyond the sky, and consider the
transfiguration to take place in the whole creation; for it will
not continue to be such as it is now, but will be far more
brilliant and beautiful, 
<pb n="100" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_100.html" id="v.iii-Page_100" />and just as gold glistens more brightly
than lead, so will the future constitution of the universe be
better than the present: even as the blessed Paul saith “Because
the creation also itself shall be delivered from the bondage of
corruption.”<note place="end" n="252" id="v.iii-p46.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p47"> <scripRef passage="Rom. viii. 21" id="v.iii-p47.1" parsed="|Rom|8|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.8.21">Rom. viii.

indeed, seeing that it partakes of corruption, it is subject to
many things such as bodies of this kind naturally experience: but
then, having divested itself of all these things, we shall see it
display its beauty in an incorruptible form: for inasmuch as it is
to receive incorruptible bodies, it will in future be itself also
transfigured into the nobler condition. Nowhere in that world will
there be sedition and strife: for great is the concord of the band
of saints, all being ever in harmony with one another. It is not
possible there to fear the devil, and the plots of demons, or the
threatenings of hell, or death, either that death which now is, or
the other death which is far worse than this, but every terror of
this kind will have been done away. And just as some royal child,
who has been brought up in mean guise, and subject to fear and
threats, lest he should deteriorate by indulgence and become
unworthy of his paternal inheritance, as soon as he has attained
the royal dignity, immediately exchanges all his former raiment for
the purple robe, and the diadem and the crowd of body-guards, and
assumes his state with much confidence, having cast out of his soul
thoughts of humility and subjection, and having taken others in
their place; even so will it happen then to all the
saints.</p>

<p class="c10" id="v.iii-p48">And to prove that these words are no empty
vaunt let us journey in thought to the mountain where Christ was
transfigured: let us behold him shining as He shone there; and yet
even then He did not display to us all the splendour of the world
to come. For that the vision was accommodated to human eyes, and
not an exact manifestation of the reality is plain from the very
words of the Evangelist. For what saith he? “He did shine as the
Sun.”<note place="end" n="253" id="v.iii-p48.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p49"> <scripRef passage="Matt. xvii. 2" id="v.iii-p49.1" parsed="|Matt|17|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.17.2">Matt.

glory of incorruptible bodies does not emit the same kind of light
as this body which is corruptible, nor is it of a kind to be
tolerable to mortal eyes, but needs incorruptible and immortal eyes
to contemplate it. But at that time on the mountain He disclosed to
them as much as it was possible for them to see without injuring
the sight of the beholders; and even so they could not endure it
but fell upon their faces. Tell me, if any one led thee into some
bright place, where all were sitting arrayed in vestures of gold,
and in the midst of the multitude pointed out one other to thee who
alone had garments wrought with precious stones, and a crown upon
his head, and then promised to place thee in the ranks of this
people, wouldst thou not do everything to obtain this promise? Open
then even now in imagination thine eyes, and look on that assembly,
composed not of men such as we are, but of those who are of more
value than gold and precious stones, and the beams of the sun, and
all visible radiance, and not consisting of men only but of beings
of much more dignity than men,—angels, archangels, thrones,
dominions, principalities, powers. For as concerning the king it is
not even possible to say what he is like: so completely do his
beauty, his grace, his splendour, his glory, his grandeur and
magnificence elude speech and thought. Shall we then, I ask,
deprive ourselves of such great blessings, in order to avoid
suffering for a brief period? For if we had to endure countless
deaths every day, or even hell itself, for the sake of seeing
Christ coming in His glory, and being enrolled in the company of
the saints, ought we not to undergo all those things? Hear what the
blessed Peter says; “it is good for us to be here.”<note place="end" n="254" id="v.iii-p49.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p50"> <scripRef passage="Matt. xvii. 4" id="v.iii-p50.1" parsed="|Matt|17|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.17.4">Matt.

very sensibly minded propose to be content with escaping hell; but
I say that a far more severe punishment than hell is exclusion from
the glory of the other world, and I think that one who has failed
to reach it ought not to sorrow so much over the miseries of hell,
as over his rejection from heaven, for this alone is more dreadful
than all other things in respect of punishment. But frequently now
when we see a king, attended by a large bodyguard, enter the
palace, we count those happy who are near him, and have a share in
his speech and mind, and partake of all the rest of his glory; and
even if we have countless blessings, we have no perception of any
of them, and deem ourselves miserable when we look at the glory of
those who are round about him, although we know that such splendour
is slippery and insecure, both on account of wars, and plots, and
envy, and because apart from these things it is not in itself
worthy of any 
<pb n="101" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_101.html" id="v.iii-Page_101" />consideration. But where the king of all is
concerned, he who holds not a portion of the earth but the whole
circuit of it, or rather who comprehends it all in the hollow of
his hand, and measures the Heavens with a span, who upholdeth all
things by the word of His power,<note place="end" n="256" id="v.iii-p52.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p53"> <scripRef passage="Heb. i. 3" id="v.iii-p53.1" parsed="|Heb|1|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Heb.1.3">Heb. i.

as nought, and as a drop of spittle;—in the case of such a king I
say shall we not reckon it the most extreme punishment to miss
being enrolled in that company which is round about him, but be
content if we merely escape hell? and what could be more pitiable
than this condition of soul? For this king does not come to judge
the earth, drawn by a pair of white mules, nor riding in a golden
chariot, nor arrayed in a purple robe and diadem. How then does He
come? Hear the prophets crying aloud and saying as much as it is
possible to tell to men: for one saith “God shall come openly,
even our God and shall not keep silence: a fire shall be kindled
before Him, and a mighty tempest shall be round about Him: He shall

not natural that every power should be confounded and shake? For if

standing by the side of the throne, but men were merely summoned

were the only punishment would not the loss of such blessings sting
the souls of those who were deprived of them more bitterly than all
hell itself? For how great an evil this is cannot possibly be
represented now in words; but then we shall know it clearly in the
actual reality. But now I pray add the punishment also to the
scene, and imagine men not only covered with shame, and veiling
their heads, and bending them low, but also being dragged along the
road to the fire, and haled away to the instruments of torture and
delivered over to the cruel powers, and suffering these things just
at the time when all they who have practised what is good, and
wrought deeds worthy of eternal life, are being crowned, and
proclaimed conquerors, and presented before the royal
throne.</p>

<p class="c10" id="v.iii-p66">13. Now these are things which will happen in
that day: but the things which will follow, after these, what
language can describe to us—the pleasure, the profit, the joy of
being in the company of Christ? For when the soul has returned to
the proper condition of nobility, and is able henceforth with much
boldness to behold its Master it is impossible to say what great
pleasure it derives therefrom, what great gain, rejoicing not only
in the good things actually in hand, but in the persuasion that
these things will never come to an end. All that gladness then
cannot be described in words, nor grasped by the understanding: but
in a dim kind of way, as one indicates great things by means of
small ones, I will endeavour to make it manifest. For let us
scrutinize those who enjoy the good things of the world in this
present life, I mean wealth and power, and glory, how, exulting
with delight, they reckon themselves as no longer being upon the
earth, and this although the things which they are enjoying are
acknowledged not to be really good, and do not abide with them, but
take to flight more quickly than a dream: and even if they should
even last for a little time, their favour is displayed within the
limits of this present life, and cannot accompany us further. Now
if these things uplift those who possess them to such a pitch of
joy, what do you suppose is the condition of those souls which are
invited to enjoy the countless blessings in Heaven which are always
securely fixed and stable? And not only this, but also in their
quantity and quality they excel present things to such an extent as
never entered even the heart of man.<note place="end" n="269" id="v.iii-p66.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p67"> <scripRef passage="Isa. 64.4; 1 Cor. 2.9" id="v.iii-p67.1" parsed="|Isa|64|4|0|0;|1Cor|2|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.64.4 Bible:1Cor.2.9">Isa. lxiv. 4, quoted in 1 Cor. ii. 9</scripRef>.</p></note> For at the present time like an
infant in the womb, even so do we dwell in this world confined in a
narrow space, and unable to behold the splendour and the freedom of
the world to come: but when the time of travail arrives and the
present life is delivered at the day of judgment of all men whom it
has contained, those who have been miscarried go from darkness into
darkness, and from affliction into more grievous affliction: but
those which are perfectly formed and have preserved the marks of
the royal image will be presented to the king, and will take upon
themselves that service which angels and archangels minister to the
God of all. I pray thee then, O friend, do not finally efface these
marks, but speedily restore them, and stamp them more perfectly on
thy soul. For corporeal beauty indeed God has confined within the
limits of nature, but grace of soul is released from the constraint
and bondage arising from that cause inasmuch as it is far superior
to any bodily symmetry: and it depends entirely upon ourselves and
the grace of God. For our Master, being merciful has in this
special way honoured our race, that He has entrusted to the
necessity of nature the inferior things which contribute nothing
much to our advantage, and in their issue are matters of
indifference, but of the things which are really noble He has
caused us to be ourselves the artificers. For if He had placed
corporeal beauty also under our control we should have been
subjected to excessive anxiety, and should have wasted all our time
upon things which are of no profit, and should have grievously
neglected our soul.</p>

<p class="c10" id="v.iii-p68">For if, even as it is, when we have not this power
in ourselves, we make violent efforts, and give ourselves up to
shadow painting, and because we cannot in reality produce bodily
beauty, cunningly devise imitations by means of paints, and dyes,
and dressing of hair, and arrangement of garments, and pencilling
of eyebrows, and many other contrivances: what leisure should we
have set apart for the soul 
<pb n="103" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_103.html" id="v.iii-Page_103" />and serious matters, if we had it in our
power to transfigure the body into a really symmetrical shape? For
probably, if this were our business, we should not have any other,
but should spend all our time upon it: decking the bondmaid with
countess decorations, but letting her who is the mistress of this
bond-maid lie perpetually in a state of deformity and neglect. For
this reason God, having delivered us from this vain occupation,
implanted in us the power of working upon the nobler element, and
he who cannot turn an ugly body into a comely one, can raise the
soul, even when it has been reduced to the extremity of ugliness,
to the very acme of grace, and make it so amiable and desirable
that not only are good men brought to long after it but even He who
is the sovereign and God of all, even as the Psalmist also when
discoursing concerning this beauty, said “And the king shall have
desire of thy beauty.”<note place="end" n="270" id="v.iii-p68.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p69"> <scripRef passage="Ps. xlv. 12" id="v.iii-p69.1" parsed="|Ps|45|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.45.12">Ps. xlv.

man, even amongst those who are very illustrious and great, would
be ashamed of marriage with her? Now if there is so much pity
amongst men, and so much disdain of glory as to release from that
bondage the women who have often been disgraced in the brothel, and
to place them in the position of wives, much more is this the case
with God, and those souls which, owing to the usurpation of the
devil, have fallen from their original noble condition into the
harlotry of this present life. And you will find the prophets
filled with examples of this kind, when they address Jerusalem; for

brought them back to their home. He would not have established
their city and their temple in greater splendour than before:

former.”<note place="end" n="273" id="v.iii-p71.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p72"> <scripRef passage="Hagg. ii. 10" id="v.iii-p72.1" parsed="|Hag|2|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Hag.2.10">Hagg. ii.

did not exclude from repentance her who had many times committed
fornication, much more will He embrace thy soul, which has now
fallen for the first time. For certainly there is no lover of
corporeal beauty, even if he be very frantic, who is so inflamed
with the love of his mistress as God longs after the salvation of
our souls; and this we may perceive both from the things which
happen every day and from the divine Scriptures. See at least, both
in the introduction of Jeremiah, and many other places of the
prophets, when He is despised and contemned, how He again hastens
forward and pursues the friendship of those who turn away from him;
which also He Himself made clear in the Gospels saying, “O
Jerusalem! Jerusalem! thou that killest the prophets and stonest
them that are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy
children together even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her
wings, and ye would not?”<note place="end" n="274" id="v.iii-p72.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p73"> <scripRef passage="Matt. xxiii. 37" id="v.iii-p73.1" parsed="|Matt|23|37|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.23.37">Matt.

<p class="c10" id="v.iii-p76">14. I know that thou art now admiring the grace of
Hermione, and thou judgest that there is nothing in the world to be
compared to her comeliness; but if you choose, O friend, you shall
yourself exceed her in comeliness and gracefulness, as much as
golden statues surpass those which are made of clay. For if beauty,
when it occurs in the body, so fascinates and excites the minds of
most men, when the soul is refulgent with it what can match beauty
and grace of this kind? For the groundwork of this corporeal beauty
is nothing else but phlegm, and blood, and humor, and bile, and the
fluid of masticated food. For by these things both eyes and cheeks,
and all the other features, are supplied with moisture; and if they
do not receive that moisture, daily skin becoming unduly withered,
and the eyes <pb n="104" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_104.html" id="v.iii-Page_104" />sunken, the
whole grace of the countenance forthwith vanishes; so that if you
consider what is stored up inside those beautiful eyes, and that
straight nose, and the mouth and the cheeks, you will affirm the
well-shaped body to be nothing else than a whited sepulchre; the
parts within are full of so much uncleanness. Moreover when you see
a rag with any of these things on it, such as phlegm, or spittle
you cannot bear to touch it with even the tips of your fingers, nay
you cannot even endure looking at it; and yet are you in a flutter
of excitement about the storehouses and depositories of these
things? But thy beauty was not of this kind, but excelled it as
heaven is superior to earth; or rather it was much better and more
brilliant than this. For no one has anywhere seen a soul by itself,
stripped of the body; but yet even so I will endeavour to present
to you the beauty of this soul from another source. I mean from the
case of the greater powers. Hear at least how the beauty of these
struck the man greatly beloved; for wishing to set forth their
beauty and being unable to find a body of the same character, he
had recourse to metallic substances, and he was not satisfied even
with these, but took the brilliancy of lightning for his
illustration.<note place="end" n="277" id="v.iii-p76.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p77"> <scripRef passage="Dan. x. 6" id="v.iii-p77.1" parsed="|Dan|10|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Dan.10.6">Dan. x.

powers, even when they did not disclose their essential nature pure
and bare, but only in a very dim and shadowy way, nevertheless
shone so brightly, what must naturally be their appearance, when
set free from every veil? Now we ought to form some such image of
the beauty of the soul. “For they shall be,” we read “equal
unto the angels.”<note place="end" n="278" id="v.iii-p77.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p78"> <scripRef passage="Luke xx. 36" id="v.iii-p78.1" parsed="|Luke|20|36|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.20.36">Luke xx.
36</scripRef>.</p></note> Now in the case of bodies the
lighter and finer kinds, and those which have retreated to the path
which tend towards the incorporeal, are very much better and more
wonderful than the others. The sky at least is more beautiful than
the earth, and fire than water, and the stars than precious stones;
and we admire the rainbow far more than violets and roses, and all
other flowers which are upon the earth. And in short if it were
possible with the bodily eyes to behold the beauty of the soul you
would laugh to scorn these corporeal illustrations, so feebly have
they presented to us the gracefulness of the soul. Let us not then
neglect such a possession, nor such great happiness, and especially
when the approach to that kind of beauty becomes easy to us by our
hopes of the things to come. “For our light affliction,” we
read, “which is but for the moment, worketh for us more and more
exceedingly an eternal weight of glory, while we look not at the
things which are seen but at the things which are not seen; for the
things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not
seen are eternal.”<note place="end" n="279" id="v.iii-p78.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p79"> <scripRef passage="2 Cor. iv. 17" id="v.iii-p79.1" parsed="|2Cor|4|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.4.17">2 Cor. iv.

afflictions as thou wottest of light and easy, because he did not
look at the things which are seen, much more tolerable is it merely
to cease from wantonness. For we are not calling thee to those

beatings and scourgings, the bonds, the enmity of the whole world,
the hatred of his own people, the frequent vigils, the long
journies, the shipwrecks, the attacks of robbers, the plots of his
own kinsfolk, the distresses on account of his friends, the hunger,
the cold, the nakedness, the burning, the despondency on account
both of those who belonged to him, and those who did not belong to
him. None of these things do we now demand of thee; all that we ask
for is that you would release yourself from your accursed bondage,
and return to your former freedom, having considered both the
punishment arising from your wantonness, and the honor belonging to
your former manner of life. For that unbelievers should be but
languidly affected by the thought of the resurrection and never be
in fear of this kind, is nothing wonderful; but that we who are
more firmly persuaded concerning the things of the other world than
those of the present, should spend our life in this miserable and
deplorable way and be nowise affected by the memory of those
things, but sink into a state of extreme insensibility—this is
irrational in the highest degree. For when we who believe do the
deeds of unbelievers, or rather are in a more miserable plight than
they (for there are some among them who have been eminent for the
virtue of their life), what consolation, what excuse will be left
for us? And many merchants indeed who have incurred shipwreck have
not given way, but have pursued the same journey, and this when the
loss which has befallen them was not owing to their own
carelessness, but to the force of the winds; and shall we who have
reason to be confident concerning the end, and know certainly that
if we do not wish it, neither shipwreck nor accident of any kind
will bring us damage, not lay hold of the work again, and carry on
our business as we did aforetime, but lie in idleness and keep our
hands to ourselves? And would that we kept them merely <i>to</i>
ourselves and did not use them <i>against</i> ourselves which is a
token of stark madness. For if any pugilist, leaving his antagonist
were to turn his hands against his own head, and deal blows to his
own face, should 
<pb n="105" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_105.html" id="v.iii-Page_105" />we not, I ask, rank him among madmen? For
the devil has upset us and cast us down; therefore we ought to get
up, and not to be dragged down again and precipitate ourselves, and
add blows dealt by ourselves to the blows dealt by him. For the
blessed David also had a fall like that which has now happened to
you; and not this only but another also which followed it. I mean
that of murder. What then? did he remain prostrate? Did he not
immediately rise up again with energy and place himself in position
to fight the enemy? In fact he wrestled with him so bravely, that
even after his death he was the protector of his offspring. For
when Solomon had perpetrated great iniquity, and had deserved
countless deaths, God said that He would leave him the kingdom
intact, thus speaking “I will surely rend the kingdom out of
thine hand and will give it to thy servant. Nevertheless I will not
do this in thy days.” Wherefore? “For David thy father’s
sake, I will take it out of the hand of thy son.”<note place="end" n="281" id="v.iii-p80.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p81"> <scripRef passage="1 Kings xi. 11" id="v.iii-p81.1" parsed="|1Kgs|11|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Kgs.11.11">1 Kings

when Hezekiah was about to run the greatest possible risk, although
he was a righteous man, God said that He would succour him for the
sake of this saint. “For I will cast my shield” He saith,
“over this city to save it for my own sake, and for my servant
David’s sake.”<note place="end" n="282" id="v.iii-p81.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p82"> <scripRef passage="2 Kings xix. 34" id="v.iii-p82.1" parsed="|2Kgs|19|34|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Kgs.19.34">2 Kings

repentance. But if he had determined with himself, as you do now,
that henceforth it was impossible to propitiate God, and if he had
said within himself: “God has honoured me with great honour, and
has given me a place among the prophets, and has entrusted me with
the government of my countrymen, and rescued me out of countless
perils, how then, when I have offended against Him after such great
benefits, and have perpetrated the worst crimes, shall I be able to
recover his favour?” If he had thought thus, not only would he
not have done the things which he afterwards did, but he would have
aggravated his former evils.</p>

<p class="c10" id="v.iii-p83">15. For not only the bodily wounds work death,
if they are neglected, but also those of the soul; and yet we have
arrived at such a pitch of folly as to take the greatest care of
the former, and to overlook the latter; and although in the case of
the body it naturally often happens that many wounds are incurable,
yet we do not abandon hope, but even when we hear the physicians
constantly declaring, that it is not possible to get rid of this
suffering by medicines, we still persist in exhorting them to
devise at least some slight alleviation; but in the case of souls,
where there is no incurable malady; for it is not subject to the
necessity of nature; here, as if the infirmities were strange we
are negligent and despairing; and where the nature of the disorder
might naturally plunge us into despair, we take as much pains as if
there were great hope of restoration to health; but where there is
no occasion to renounce hope, we desist from efforts, and become as
heedless as if matters were desperate; so much more account do we
take of the body than of the soul. And this is the reason why we
are not able to save even the body. For he who neglects the leading
element, and manifests all his zeal about inferior matters destroys
and loses both; whereas he who observes the right order, and
preserves and cherishes the more commanding element, even if he
neglects the secondary element yet preserves it by means of saving
the primary one. Which also Christ signified to us when He said,
“Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the
soul; but rather fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body
in Hell.”<note place="end" n="283" id="v.iii-p83.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p84"> <scripRef passage="Matt. x. 28" id="v.iii-p84.1" parsed="|Matt|10|28|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.10.28">Matt. x.

<p class="c10" id="v.iii-p85">Well, do I convince you, that one ought never
to despair of the disorders of the soul as incurable? or must I
again set other arguments in motion? For even if thou shouldst
despair of thyself ten thousand times, I will never despair of
thee, and I will never myself be guilty of that for which I
reproach others; and yet it is not the same thing for a man to
renounce hope of himself, as for another to renounce hope of him.
For he who has this suspicion concerning another may readily obtain
pardon; but he who has it of himself will not. Why so pray? Because
the one has no controlling power over the zeal and repentance of
the other, but over his own zeal and repentance a man has sole
authority. Nevertheless even so I will not despair of you; though
you should any number of times be affected in this way; for it may
be, that there will be some return to virtue, and to restoration to
thy former manner of life. And now hear what follows: The Ninevites
when they heard the prophet vehemently declaring, and plainly
threatening; “yet three days and Nineveh shall be
overthrown,”<note place="end" n="284" id="v.iii-p85.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p86"> <scripRef passage="Jonah iii. 4" id="v.iii-p86.1" parsed="|Jonah|3|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Jonah.3.4">Jonah iii.

did not lose heart, but, although they had no confidence that they
should be able to move the mind of God, or rather had reason to
suspect the contrary from the divine message (for the utterance was
not accompanied by any qualification, but was a simple
declaration), even then they manifested repentance saying: “Who
knoweth whether God will repent and be entreated, and turn from the
fierceness of His wrath, and that we perish not? And God
<pb n="106" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_106.html" id="v.iii-Page_106" />saw their works that they
turned from their evil ways, and God repented of the evil which He
said He would do unto them and He did it not.”<note place="end" n="285" id="v.iii-p86.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p87"> <scripRef passage="Jonah iii. 9, 10" id="v.iii-p87.1" parsed="|Jonah|3|9|3|10" osisRef="Bible:Jonah.3.9-Jonah.3.10">Jonah iii.

men could perceive so much, much more ought we to do this who have
been trained in the divine doctrines and have seen such a crowd of
examples of this kind both in history and actual experience. “For
my counsels” we read “are not as your counsels nor my ways as
your ways; but far as is the Heaven from the earth, so far are my
thoughts from your mind, and my counsels from your counsels.”<note place="end" n="286" id="v.iii-p87.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p88"> <scripRef passage="Isa. lv. 8, 9" id="v.iii-p88.1" parsed="|Isa|55|8|55|9" osisRef="Bible:Isa.55.8-Isa.55.9">Isa. lv.

little from the <span class="c12" id="v.iii-p88.2">LXX</span>.</p></note> Now if we
admit to our favour household slaves when they have often offended
against us, on their promising to become better, and place them
again in their former portion, and sometimes even grant them
greater freedom of speech than before; much more does God act thus.
For if God had made us in order to punish us, you might well have
despaired, and questioned the possibility of your own salvation;
but if He created us for no reason than His own good will, and with
a view to our enjoying everlasting blessings, and if He does and
contrives everything for this end, from the first day until the
present time, what is there which can ever cause you to doubt? Have
we provoked Him severely, so as no other man ever did? this is just
the reason why we ought specially to abstain from our present deeds
and to repent for the past, and exhibit a great change. For the
evils we have once perpetrated cannot provoke Him so much as our
being unwilling to make any change in the future. For to sin may be
a merely human failing, but to continue in the same sin ceases to
be human, and becomes altogether devilish. For observe how God by
the mouth of His prophet blames this more than the other.
“For,” we read, “I said unto her after she had done all these
deeds of fornication, return unto me, and yet she returned
not.”<note place="end" n="287" id="v.iii-p88.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p89"> <scripRef passage="Jer. iii. 7" id="v.iii-p89.1" parsed="|Jer|3|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Jer.3.7">Jer. iii.
7</scripRef>.</p></note> And again:
from another quarter, when wishing to show the great longing which
He has for our salvation, having heard how the people promised,
after many transgressions, to tread the right way He said: “Who
will grant unto them to have such an heart as to fear me, and to
keep my commandments all their days, that it may be well with them
and with their children forever?”<note place="end" n="288" id="v.iii-p89.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p90"> <scripRef passage="Deut. v. 29" id="v.iii-p90.1" parsed="|Deut|5|29|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Deut.5.29">Deut. v.

said, “And now, O Israel, what doth the Lord thy God require of
thee, but to fear the Lord thy God, and to walk in all His ways,
and to love Him?”<note place="end" n="289" id="v.iii-p90.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p91"> <scripRef passage="Deut. x. 12" id="v.iii-p91.1" parsed="|Deut|10|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Deut.10.12">Deut. x.
12</scripRef>.</p></note> He then who is so anxious to be
loved by us, and does everything for this end, and did not spare
even His only begotten Son on account of His love towards us, and
who counts it a desirable thing if at any time we become reconciled
to Himself, how shall He not welcome and love us when we repent?
Hear at least what He says by the mouth of the prophet: “Declare
thou first thy iniquities that thou mayest be justified.”<note place="end" n="290" id="v.iii-p91.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p92"> <scripRef passage="Isa. xliii. 26" id="v.iii-p92.1" parsed="|Isa|43|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.43.26">Isa.
xliii. 26</scripRef>.</p></note> Now this He
demands from us in order to intensify our love towards Him. For
when one who loves, after enduring many insults at the hands of
those who are beloved, even then does not extinguish his fondness
for them, the only reason why he takes pains to make those insults
public, is that by displaying the strength of his affection he may
induce them to feel a larger and warmer love. Now if the confession
of sins brings so much consolation, much more does the endeavour to
wash them away by means of our deeds. For if this was not the case,
but those who had once swerved from the straight path were
forbidden to return to it again, perhaps no one, except a few
persons whose numbers would be easily reckoned, would ever enter
the kingdom of Heaven; but as it is we shall find the most
distinguished among those who have fallen. For those who have
exhibited much vehemence in evil things, will also in turn exhibit
the same in good things, being conscious what great debts they have
incurred; which Christ also declared when He spoke to Simon
concerning the woman: “For seest thou,” saith He, “this
woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my
feet; but she hath washed my feet with her tears, and wiped them
with the hairs of her head. Thou gavest me no kiss, but she since
the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet. Mine head with
oil thou didst not anoint; but she hath anointed my feet with
ointment. Wherefore I say unto thee: her sins which are many are
forgiven; for she loved much; but to whom little is forgiven, the
same loveth little. And He said unto her, thy sins are
forgiven.”<note place="end" n="291" id="v.iii-p92.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p93"> <scripRef passage="Luke vii. 44-48" id="v.iii-p93.1" parsed="|Luke|7|44|7|48" osisRef="Bible:Luke.7.44-Luke.7.48">Luke vii.
44–48</scripRef>.</p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="v.iii-p94">16. For this reason also the devil, knowing that
they who have committed great evils, when they have begun to
repent, do this with much zeal, inasmuch as they are conscious of
their offences, fears and trembles lest they should make a
beginning of the work; for after they have made it they are no
longer capable of being checked, and, kindling like fire under the
influence of repentance, they render their souls purer than pure
gold, being impelled by their conscience, and the memory of their
former sins, as by some strong gale, towards the haven of virtue.
And this is the point in <pb n="107" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_107.html" id="v.iii-Page_107" />which
they have an advantage over those who have never fallen, that they
exercise more vehement energy; if only, as I said, they can lay
hold of the beginning. For the task which is hard and difficult of
accomplishment is to be able to set foot on the entrance, and to
reach the vestibule of repentance, and to repulse and overthrow the
enemy there when he is fiercely raging and assaulting us. But after
this, he will not display so much fury when he has once been
worsted, and has fallen where he was strong, and we shall receive
greater energy, and shall run this good race with much ease. Let us
then in future set about our return, let us hasten up to the city
which is in Heaven, in which we have been enrolled, in which also
we have been appointed to find our home as citizens. For to despair
of ourselves not only has this evil that it shuts the gates of that
city against us, and that it drives us into greater indolence and
contempt, but also that it plunges us into Satanic recklessness.
For the only cause why the devil became such as he is was that he
first of all despaired, and afterwards from despair sank into
recklessness. For the soul, when once it has abandoned its own
salvation, will no longer perceive that it is plunging downwards,
choosing to do and say everything which is adverse to its own
salvation. And just as madmen, when once they have fallen out of a
sound condition, are neither afraid nor ashamed of anything, but
fearlessly dare all manner of things, even if they have to fall
into fire, or deep water, or down a precipice; so they who have
been seized by the frenzy of despair are hence forward
unmanageable, rushing into vice in every direction, and if death
does not come to put a stop to this madness, and vehemence, they do
themselves infinite mischief. Therefore I entreat you, before you
are deeply steeped in this drunkenness, recover your senses and
rouse yourself up, and shake off this Satanic fit, doing it gently
and gradually if it be not possible to effect it all at once. For
to me indeed the easier course seems to be to wrench yourself once
for all out of all the cords which hold you down, and transfer
yourself to the school of repentance. But if this seems to you a
difficult thing, that you should be willing to enter on the path
which leads to better things, simply enter upon it, and lay hold on
eternal life. Yea, I beseech and implore you by your former
reputation, by that confidence which once was yours, let us see you
once again standing on the pinnacle of virtue, and in the same
condition of perseverance as before. Spare those who are made to
stumble on thy account, those who are falling, who are becoming
more indolent, who are despairing of the way of virtue. For
dejection now holds possession of the band of brethren, while
pleasure and cheerfulness prevail in the councils of the
unbelieving, and of those young men who are disposed to indolence.
But if thou return again to thy former strictness of life the
result will be reversed, and all our shame will be transferred to
them, while we shall enjoy much confidence, seeing thee again
crowned and proclaimed victor with more splendour than before. For
such victories bring greater renown and pleasure. For you will not
only receive the reward of your own achievements, but also of the
exhortation and consolation of others, being exhibited as a
striking model, if ever any one should fall into the same
condition, to encourage him to get up and recover himself. Do not
neglect such an opportunity of gain, nor drag our souls down into
Hades with sorrow, but let us breathe freely again, and shake off
the cloud of despondency which oppresses us on thy account. For
now, passing by the consideration of our own troubles, we mourn
over thy calamities, but if thou art willing to come to thy senses,
and see clearly, and to join the angelic host, you will release us
from this sorrow, and will take away the greater part of sins. For
that it is possible for those who have come back again after
repentance to shine with much lustre, and oftentimes more than
those who have never fallen at all, I have demonstrated from the
divine writings. Thus at least both the publicans and the harlots
inherit the kingdom of Heaven, thus many of the last are placed
before the first.</p>

<p class="c10" id="v.iii-p95">17. But I will tell thee also of events which have
happened in our own time, and of which thou mayest thyself have
been witness. You know probably that young Phœnician, the son of
Urbanus, who was untimely left an orphan, but possessed of much
money, and many slaves and lands. This man, having in the first
place bidden complete farewell to his studies in the schools, and
having laid aside the gay clothing which he formerly wore, and all
his worldly grandeur, suddenly arraying himself in a shabby cloak,
and retreating to the solitude of the mountains, exhibited a high
degree of Christian philosophy not merely in proportion to his age,
but such as any great and wonderful man might have displayed. And
after this, having been deemed worthy of initiation into the sacred
mysteries, he made still greater advances in virtue. And all were
rejoicing, and glorifying God, that one nurtured in wealth, and
having illustrious ancestors, and being still a mere youth, should
have suddenly trodden all the pomps of this life under foot, and
have ascended to the true height. Now which he 
<pb n="108" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_108.html" id="v.iii-Page_108" />was in this condition, and an object of
admiration, certain corrupt men, who according to the law of
kindred had the oversight of him dragged him back again into the
former sea of worldliness. And so, having flung aside all his
habits, he again descended from the mountains into the midst of the
forum, and used to go all round the city, riding on horseback, and
accompanied by a large retinue; and he was no longer willing to
live even soberly; for being inflamed by much luxury, he was
constrained to fall into foolish love intrigues, and there was no
one of those conversant with him, who did not despair of his
salvation; he was encompassed by such a swarm of flatterers,
besides the snares of orphanhood, youth, and great wealth. And
persons who readily find fault with everything, accused those who
originally conducted him to this way of life,<note place="end" n="292" id="v.iii-p95.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p96"> <i>i.e</i>., the life of monastic seclusion.</p></note> saying that he had both missed his
spiritual aims, and would no longer be of any use in the management
of his own affairs, having prematurely abandoned the labours of
study, and having been consequently unable to derive any benefit
therefrom. Now while these things were being said, and great shame
was felt, certain holy men who had often succeeded in this kind of
chase, and had thoroughly learned by experience that those who are
armed with hope in God ought not to despair at all of such
characters, kept a continual watch upon him, and if ever they saw
him appear in the market place they approached and saluted him. And
at first he spoke to them from horseback, askance, as they followed
by his side; so great was the shamelessness which had at first got
possession of him. But they, being merciful and loving men, were
not ashamed at all of this treatment, but continually looked to one
thing only, how they might rescue the lamb from the wolves; which
in fact they actually accomplished by means of their perseverance.
For afterwards, as if he had been converted by some sudden stroke,
and were put to shame by their great assiduity, if ever he saw them
in the distance approaching, he would instantly dismount, and
bending low would listen silently in that attitude to all which
fell from their lips, and in time he displayed even greater
reverence and respect towards them. And then, by the grace of God
having gradually rescued him out of all those entanglements, they
handed him over again to his former state of seclusion and devout
contemplation. And now he became so illustrious, that his former
life seemed to be nothing in comparison with that which he lived
after his fall. For being well aware by experience of the snare,
and having expended all his wealth upon the needy, and released
himself from all care of that kind, he cut off every pretext for an
attack from those who wished to make designs upon him; and now
treading the path which leads to heaven, he has already arrived at
the very goal of virtue.</p>

<p class="c10" id="v.iii-p97">This man indeed fell and rose again while he was
still young; but another man, after enduring great toils during his
sojourn in the deserts, with only a single companion, and leading
an angelic life, and being now on the way to old age, afforded I
know not how a little loophole to the evil one, through some
Satanic condition of mind, and carelessness; and although he had
never seen a woman since he transferred himself to the monastic
life, he fell into a passionate desire for intercourse with women.
And first of all he besought his companion to supply him with meat
and wine, and threatened, if he did not receive it, that he would
go down into the marketplace. And this he said, not so much out of
a longing for meat, as because he wished to get some handle and
pretext for returning into the city. The other being perplexed at
these things, and fearing, that if he hindered this he might drive
him into some great evil, suffered him to have his fill of this
craving. But when his companion perceived that this was a stale
device, he openly threw off shame, and unmasked his pretence, and
said that he must positively himself go down to the city, and as
the other had not power to prevent him, he desisted at last from
his efforts, and following him at a distance, watched to see what
the meaning of this return could possibly be. And having seen him
enter a brothel, and knowing that he had intercourse with a harlot
there, he waited until he had satiated that foul desire, and then,
when he came out, he received him with uplifted hands, and having
embraced and fervently kissed him, without uttering any rebuke on
account of what had happened he only besought him, seeing that he
had satiated his desire, to return again to his dwelling in the
wilderness. And the other, put to shame by his great clemency, was
immediately smitten at the heart of compunction for the deed which
he had perpetrated, followed him to the mountain; and there he
begged the man to shut him up in another hut, and, having closed
the doors of the dwelling, to supply him with bread and water on
certain days, and to inform those who enquired for him that he was
laid to rest. And when he had said this, and persuaded him, he shut
himself up, and was there continually, with fastings and prayers
and tears, wiping off from his soul the defilement of his sin. And
not long after when a drought had 
<pb n="109" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_109.html" id="v.iii-Page_109" />settled on the neighbouring region, and all
in that country were lamenting over it, a certain man was commanded
by a vision to depart, and exhort this recluse to pray, and put an
end to the drought. And when he had departed, taking companions
with him, they found the man, who formerly dwelt with him, there
alone; and on enquiring concerning the other they were informed
that he was dead. But they, believing that they were deceived,
betook themselves again to prayer, and again by means of the same
vision heard the same things which they had heard before. And then,
standing round the man who really had deceived them, they besought
him to show the other to them; for they declared that he was not
dead but living. When he heard this, and perceived that their
compact was exposed, he brought them to that holy man; and they
having broken through the wall (for he had even blocked up the
entrance) and having all of them entered, prostrating themselves at
his feet, and informing him of what had happened, besought him to
succour them against the famine. But he at first resisted, saying
that he was far from such confidence as that; for he ever had his
sin before his eyes, as if it had only just taken place; but when
they related all which had happened to them they then induced him
to pray; and having prayed he put an end to the drought. And what
happened to that young man who was at first a disciple of John the
son of Zebedee, but afterwards for a long time became a robber
chief, and then again, having been captured by the holy hands of
the blessed Apostle returned from the robber dens and lairs to his
former virtue, thou art not ignorant, but knowest it all as
accurately as I do: and I have often heard thee admiring the great
condescension of the saint, and how he first of all kissed the
blood-stained hand of the young man, embracing him, and so brought
him back to his former condition.<note place="end" n="293" id="v.iii-p97.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p98"> The story is told by Clement of Alexandria in his

<p class="c10" id="v.iii-p99">18. Moreover also the blessed Paul not only
welcomes Onesimus the unprofitable runaway thief, because he was
converted, but also asks his master to treat him who had repented,
on equal terms of honour with his teacher, thus saying: “I
beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds,
who was aforetime unprofitable to thee, but now is profitable to
thee and to me, whom I have sent back to thee; thou therefore
receive him, that is my very heart, whom I would fain have kept
with me, that in thy behalf he might minister unto me in the bonds
of the Gospel; but without thy mind I would do nothing that thy
goodness should not be as of necessity, but of free will. For
perhaps he was therefore parted from thee for a season that thou
shouldest have him back for ever; no longer as a servant, but above
a servant, a brother beloved, specially unto me; but how much
rather to thee both in the flesh and in the Lord? If then thou
holdest me as a partner, receive him as myself.”<note place="end" n="294" id="v.iii-p99.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p100"> <scripRef passage="Philem. 10-18" id="v.iii-p100.1" parsed="|Phlm|1|10|1|18" osisRef="Bible:Phlm.1.10-Phlm.1.18">Philem.

beforehand and do now say beforehand, as if I were present the
second time, and being absent I write,” implies exactly that
which we are afraid may take place now in our case. For although
Paul is not present who then threatened the Corinthians, yet Christ
is present, who was then speaking through his mouth; and if we
continue obdurate, He will not spare us, but will smite us with a
mighty blow, both in this world and the next. “Let us then

different meaning is given to the passage in our English Version
[Revised].</p></note> Let us not then tarry for the
accuser, but let us seize his place beforehand, and so let us make
our judge more merciful by means of our candour. Now I know indeed
that you confess your sins, and call yourself miserable above
measure; but this is not the only thing I wish, but I long for you
to be persuaded that it can justify you. For as long as you make
this confession unprofitable, even if you accuse yourself, you will
not be able to desist from the sins which follow it. For no one
will be able to do anything with zeal and the proper method, unless
he has first of all persuaded himself that he does it to advantage.
For even the sower, after he has scattered his seed, unless he
expects the harvest, will never reap. For who would choose to
fatigue himself in vain, if he was not to gain any good from his
labor? So <pb n="110" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_110.html" id="v.iii-Page_110" />then he
also who sows words, and tears, and confession, unless he does this
with a good hope, will not be able to desist from sinning, being
still held down by the evil of despair; but just as that husbandman
who despairs of any crop of fruit will not in future hinder any of
those things which damage the seeds, so also he who sows his
confession with tears, but does not expect any advantage for this,
will not be able to overthrow those things which spoil repentance.
And what does spoil repentance is being again entangled in the same
evils. “For there is one” we read, “who builds, and one who
pulls down, what have they gained more than toil? He who is dipped
in water because of contact with a dead body, and then touches it
again, what has he gained by his washing?”<note place="end" n="300" id="v.iii-p105.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p106"> <scripRef passage="Ecclesiasticus 34.23,25" id="v.iii-p106.1" parsed="|Sir|34|23|0|0;|Sir|34|25|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Sir.34.23 Bible:Sir.34.25">Ecclus. xxxiv. 23,

<p class="c10" id="v.iii-p109">19. Do not then merely set forth thy sins
being thy own accuser, but as one who ought to be justified by the
method of repentance; for thus thou wilt be able to put thy soul,
which makes its confession, to shame, so that it falls no more into
the same sins. For to accuse ourselves vehemently and call
ourselves sinners is common, so to say, to unbelievers also. Many
at least of those who belong to the stage, both men and women, who
habitually practise the greatest shamelessness, call themselves
miserable, but not with the proper aim. Wherefore I would not even
call this confession; for the publication of their sins is not
accompanied with compunction of soul, nor with bitter tears, nor
with conversion of life, but in fact some of them make it in quest
of a reputation for the hearers for candor of speech. For offences
do not seem so grievous when some other person announces them as
when the perpetrator himself reports them. And they who under the
influence of strong despair have lapsed into a state of
insensibility, and treat the opinion of their fellowmen with
contempt proclaim their own evil deeds with much effrontery, as if
they were the doings of others. But I do not wish thee to be any of
these, nor to be brought out of despair to confession, but with a
good expectation, after cutting away the whole root of despair, to
manifest zeal in the contrary direction. And what is the root and
mother of this despair? It is indolence; or rather one would not
call it the root only, but also the nurse and mother. For as in the
case of wool decay breeds moths, and is in turn increased by them;
so here also indolence breeds despair, and is itself nourished in
turn by despair; and thus supplying each other with this accursed
exchange, they acquire no small additional power. If any one then
cuts one of these off, and hews it in pieces, he will easily be
able to get the better of the remaining one. For on the one hand he
who is not indolent will never fall into despair, and on the other
he who is supported by good hopes, and does not despair of himself,
will not be able to fall into indolence. Pray then, wrench this
pair asunder, and break the yoke in pieces, by which I mean a
variable and yet depressing habit of thought; for that which holds
these two things together is not uniform, but manifold in shame and
character. And what is this? It happens that one who has repented
has done many great and good deeds, but meanwhile he has committed
some sin equivalent to those good deeds, and this especially is
sufficient to plunge him into despair, as if the buildings which
had been set up were all pulled down, and all the labor which he
had bestowed upon them had been vain and come to naught. But this
must be taken into account, and such reasoning must be repelled,
because, if we do not store up in good time a measure of good deeds
equivalent to the sins which are committed after them, nothing can
hinder us from sinking grievously and completely. But as it is,
(right action<note place="end" n="303" id="v.iii-p109.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p110"> These words seem to be understood, although they
are not expressed in the original.</p></note>) like some
stout breastplate does not suffer the sharp and bitter dart to
accomplish its work, but even if it is itself cut through, it
averts much danger from the body. For he who departs to the other
world with many deeds both good and bad, will have some alleviation
in respect of the punishment and the torment there; but if a man is
destitute of these good works, and takes only the evil with him, it
is impossible to say what great sufferings he will undergo, when he
is conducted to everlasting punishment. For a balance will be
struck there between the evil deeds and those which are not such;
and should the latter weigh down the scale they will to no small
extent have saved the doer of them, and the injury arising from the
doing of evil deeds is not so strong as to drag the man down from
the foremost place; but if the evil deeds exceed, they carry him
off into hell fire, because the number of his good actions is not
so great as to be able to make a stand against this violent
impulse. And these things are not merely sug<pb n="111" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_111.html" id="v.iii-Page_111" />gested by our own reasoning,
but declared also by the divine oracles; for He Himself saith,
“He shall reward every man according to his works.”<note place="end" n="304" id="v.iii-p110.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p111"> <scripRef passage="Rom. ii. 6" id="v.iii-p111.1" parsed="|Rom|2|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.2.6">Rom. ii.
6</scripRef>.</p></note> And not only
in hell, but also in the kingdom one will find many differences;
for He saith “in my Fathers house are many mansions;”<note place="end" n="305" id="v.iii-p111.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p112"> <scripRef passage="John xiv. 2" id="v.iii-p112.1" parsed="|John|14|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.14.2">John xiv.

“there is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the
moon.”<note place="end" n="306" id="v.iii-p112.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p113"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. xv. 41" id="v.iii-p113.1" parsed="|1Cor|15|41|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.15.41">1 Cor. xv.
41</scripRef>.</p></note> And what
wonder, if in dealing with such great matters he has spoken with
such precision, seeing that He declares there is a difference in
that world even between one star and another? Knowing then all
these things let us never desist from doing good deeds, nor grow
weary, nor, if we should be unable to reach the rank of the sun or
of the moon, let us despise that of the stars. For if only we
display thus much virtue at least, we shall be able to have a place
in Heaven. And though we may not have become gold, or precious
stone, yet if we only occupy the rank of silver we shall abide in
the foundation; only let us not fall back again into that material
which the fire readily devours, nor, when we are unable to
accomplish great things, desist also from small ones, for this is
the part of extreme folly, which I trust we may not experience. For
just as material wealth increases if the lovers of it do not
despise even the smallest gains, so is it also with the spiritual.
For it is a strange thing that the judge should not overlook the
reward of even a cup of cold water, but that we, if our
achievements are not altogether great, should neglect the
performance of little things. For he who does not despise the
lesser things, will exercise much zeal concerning the greatest; but
he who overlooks the former will also abstain from the latter; and
to prevent this taking place Christ has defined great rewards even
for these small things. For what is easier than to visit the sick?
Yet even this He requites with a great recompense. Lay hold then on
eternal life, delight in the Lord, and supplicate Him; take up
again the easy yoke, bow thyself beneath the light burden, put a
finish to thy life worthy of the beginning; do not suffer so great
a stream of wealth to slip past thee. For if thou shouldst continue
provoking God by thy deeds, thou wilt destroy thyself; but if
before much damage has been done, and all thy husbandry has been
overwhelmed with a flood, thou wilt dam up the channels of
wickedness, thou wilt be able to recover again what has been
spoiled and to add to it not a little further produce. Having
considered all these things, shake off the dust, get up from the
ground, and thou wilt be formidable to the adversary; for he
himself indeed has overthrown thee, as if thou wouldst never rise
again; but if he sees thee again lifting up thy hands against him,
he will receive such an unexpected blow that he will be less
forward in trying to upset thee again, and thou thyself wilt be
more secure against receiving any wound of that kind in future. For
if the calamities of others are sufficient to instruct us, much
more those which we have ourselves undergone. And this is what I
expect speedily to see in the case of thy own dear self, and that
by the grace of God thou art again become more radiant than before,
and displaying such great virtue, as even to be a protector of
others in the world above. Only do not despair, do not fall back;
for I will not cease repeating this in every form of speech, and
wherever I see you, as well as by the lips of others; and if you
listen to this you will no longer need other remedies.</p>

<span class="c17" id="v.iv-p1.1">Letter II.</span></p>

<p class="c9" id="v.iv-p2">1. <span class="c12" id="v.iv-p2.1">If</span> it were possible
to express tears and groans by means of writing I would have filled
the letter, which I now send to you, with them. Now I weep not
because you are anxious concerning your patrimony, but because you
have blotted out your name from the list of the brethren, because
you have trampled upon the covenant which you had made with Christ.
This is the reason why I shudder, this is the cause of my distress.
On this account do I fear and tremble, knowing that the rejection
of this covenant will bring great condemnation upon those who have
enlisted for this noble warfare, and owing to indolence have
deserted their proper rank. And that the punishment for such is
heavier than for others is manifest for this reason. For no one
would indite a private individual for shunning military service;
but when once a man has become a soldier, if he be caught deserting
the ranks, he runs a risk of suffering the most extreme penalty.
There is nothing strange, beloved Theodore, in a wrestler falling,
but in his remaining in a fallen condition; neither is it a
grievous thing for the warrior to be wounded, but to despair after
the blow has been struck, and to neglect the wound. No merchant,
having once suffered shipwreck, and lost his freight, desists from
sailing, but again crosses the sea and the billows, and the broad
ocean, and recovers his former wealth. We see athletes also who
after many falls have gained the wreath of victory; and often,
before now, a soldier who has once ran away has turned out a
champion, and prevailed over the enemy. Many also of those who have
denied <pb n="112" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_112.html" id="v.iv-Page_112" />Christ owing to
the pressure of torture, have fought again, and departed at last
with the crown of martyrdom upon their brows. But if each of these
had despaired after the first blow, he would not have reaped the
subsequent benefits. Even so now, beloved Theodore, because the
enemy has shaken thee a little from thy position, do not thou give
thyself an additional thrust into the pit, but stand up bravely,
and return speedily to the place from which thou hast departed, and
deem not this blow, lasting but for a little while, any reproach.
For if you saw a soldier returning wounded from war you would not
reproach him; for it is a reproach to cast away one’s arms, and
to hold aloof from the enemy; but as long as a man stands fighting,
even if he be wounded and retreat for a short time, no one is so
unfeeling or inexperienced in matters of war, as to find any fault
with him. Exemption from wounds is the lot of non-combatants; but
those who advance with much spirit against the enemy may sometimes
be wounded and fail; which is exactly what has now occurred in your
case; for suddenly, while you attempted to destroy the serpent you
were bitten. But take courage, you need a little vigilance, and
then not a trace of this wound will be left; or rather by the grace
of God thou wilt crush the head of the Evil One himself; nor let it
trouble thee that thou art soon impeded, even at the outset. For
the eye, the keen eye of the Evil One perceived the excellence of
thy soul, and guessed from many tokens that a brave adversary would
wax strong against him; for he expected that one who had promptly
attacked him with such great vehemence would easily overcome him,
if he persevered. Therefore he was diligent, and watchful, and
mightily stirred up against thee, or rather against his own head,
if thou wilt bravely stand thy ground. For who did not marvel at
thy quick, sincere, and fervent change to good? For delicacy of
food was disregarded, and costliness of raiment was despised, all
manner of parade was put down, and all the zeal for the wisdom of
this world was suddenly transferred to the divine oracles; whole
days were spent in reading, and whole nights in prayer; no mention
was made of thy family dignity, nor any thought taken of thy
wealth; but to clasp the knees and hasten to the feet of the
brethren thou didst recognize as something nobler than high birth.
These things irritated the Evil One, these things stirred him up to
more vehement strife; but yet he did not give a deadly blow. For if
after a long time, and continual fastings, and sleeping on the bare
ground and the rest of the discipline he overthrew you, even then
there was no need to despair; nevertheless one would have said that
the damage was great if defeat had taken place after many toils,
and labour, and victories; but inasmuch as he upset you as soon as
you had stripped for the contest with him, all that he accomplished
was to render you more eager to do battle with him. For that fell
pirate attacked thee just as thou wast sailing out of the harbor,
not when thou hadst returned from thy trading voyage, bringing a
full cargo. And as when one has attempted to stay a fierce lion,
and has only grazed his skin, he has done him no injury but only
stirred him up the more against himself, and rendered him more
confident and difficult to capture afterwards: even so the common
enemy of all has attempted to strike a deep blow, but has missed
it, and consequently made his antagonist more vigilant and wary for
the future.</p>

<p class="c10" id="v.iv-p3">2. For human nature is a slippery thing, quick
to be cheated, but quick also to recover from deceit and as it
speedily falls, so also does it readily rise. For even that blessed
man, I mean David the chosen king and prophet, after he had
accomplished many good deeds, betrayed himself to be a man, for
once he fell in love with a strange woman, nor did he stop there
but he committed adultery on account of his passion, and he
committed murder on account of his adultery; but he did not try to
inflict a third blow upon himself because he had already received
two such heavy ones, but immediately hastened to the physician, and
applied the remedies, fasting, tears, lamentation, constant prayer,
frequent confession of the sin; and so by these means he
propitiated God, insomuch that he was restored to his former
position, insomuch that after adultery and murder the memory of the
father was able to shield the idolatry of the son. For the son of
this David, Solomon by name, was caught by the same snare as his
father, and out of complaisance to women fell away from the God of
his fathers.<note place="end" n="307" id="v.iv-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.iv-p4"> <scripRef passage="1 Kings xi. 3, 4" id="v.iv-p4.1" parsed="|1Kgs|11|3|11|4" osisRef="Bible:1Kgs.11.3-1Kgs.11.4">1 Kings

you will allege weakness of nature as the excuse, and inability to
bear the yoke. And what kind of defence is this, that you have not
strength to bear the easy yoke, that you are unable to carry the
light burden? Is recovery from fatigue a grievous and oppressive
thing? For it is to this that Christ calls us, saying, “Come unto
me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you

be lighter I ask, than to be released from anxieties, and business,

life, and dwell in a tranquil haven?</p>

<p class="c10" id="v.iv-p13">3. Which of all things in the world seems to
you most desirable and enviable? No doubt you will say government,
and wealth, and public reputation. And yet what is more wretched
than these things when they are compared with the liberty of
Christians. For the ruler is subjected to the wrath of the populace
and to the irrational impulses of the multitude, and to the fear of
higher rulers, and to anxieties on behalf of those who are ruled,
and the ruler of yesterday becomes a private citizen to-day; for
this present life in no wise differs from a stage, but just as
there, one man fills the position of a king, a second of a general,
and a third of a soldier, but when evening has come on the king is
no king, the ruler no ruler, and the general no general, even so
also in that day each man will receive his due reward not according
to the outward part which he has played but according to his works.
Well! is glory a precious thing which perishes like the power of
grass? or wealth, the possessors of which are pronounced unhappy?
“For woe” we read, “to the rich;”<note place="end" n="315" id="v.iv-p13.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.iv-p14"> <scripRef passage="Luke vi. 24" id="v.iv-p14.1" parsed="|Luke|6|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.6.24">Luke vi.
24</scripRef>.</p></note> and again, “Woe unto them who
trust in their strength and boast themselves in the multitude of
their riches!”<note place="end" n="316" id="v.iv-p14.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.iv-p15"> <scripRef passage="Ps. xlix. 6" id="v.iv-p15.1" parsed="|Ps|49|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.49.6">Ps. xlix.

Christian never becomes a private person after being a ruler, or a
poor man after being rich, or without honour after being held in
honour; but he abides rich even when he is poor, and is exalted
when he strives to humble himself; and from the rule which he
exercises no human being can depose him, but only one of those
rulers who are under the power of this world’s potentate of
darkness.</p>

<p class="c10" id="v.iv-p16">“Marriage is right,” you say; I also
assent to this. For “marriage,” we read, “is honourable and
the bed undefiled; but fornicators and adulterers God will
judge;”<note place="end" n="317" id="v.iv-p16.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.iv-p17"> <scripRef passage="Heb. xiii. 4" id="v.iv-p17.1" parsed="|Heb|13|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Heb.13.4">Heb. xiii.
4</scripRef>.</p></note> but it is no
longer possible for thee to observe the right conditions of
marriage. For if he who has been attached to a heavenly bridegroom
deserts him, and joins himself to a wife the act is adultery, even
if you call it marriage ten thousand times over; or rather it is
worse than adultery in proportion as God is greater than man. Let
no one deceive thee saying: “God hath not forbidden to marry;”
I know this as well as you; He has not forbidden to marry, but He
has forbidden to commit adultery, may you be preserved from ever
engaging thyself in marriage! And why dost thou marvel if marriage
is judged as if it were adultery, when God is disregarded?
Slaughter has brought about righteousness, and mercy has been a
cause of condemnation more than 
<pb n="114" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_114.html" id="v.iv-Page_114" />slaughter; because the latter has been
according to the mind of God but the former has been forbidden. It
was reckoned to Phinees for righteousness that he pierced to death
the woman who committed fornication, together with the
fornicator;<note place="end" n="318" id="v.iv-p17.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.iv-p18"> <scripRef passage="Num. xxv. 7-11" id="v.iv-p18.1" parsed="|Num|25|7|25|11" osisRef="Bible:Num.25.7-Num.25.11">Num. xxv.
7–11</scripRef>.</p></note> but Samuel,
that saint of God although he wept and mourned and entreated for
whole nights, could not rescue Saul from the condemnation which God
issued against him, because he saved, contrary to the design of
God, the king of the alien tribes whom he ought to have slain.<note place="end" n="319" id="v.iv-p18.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.iv-p19"> <scripRef passage="1 Sam. xv" id="v.iv-p19.1" parsed="|1Sam|15|0|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Sam.15">1 Sam.
xv</scripRef>.</p></note> If then
mercy has been a cause of condemnation more than slaughter because
God was disobeyed, what wonder is it if marriage condemns more than
adultery when it involves the rejection of Christ? For, as I said
at the beginning, if you were a private person no one would indict
you for shunning to serve as a soldier; but now thou art no longer
thy own master, being engaged in the service of so great a king.
For if the wife hath not power over her own body, but the
husband,<note place="end" n="320" id="v.iv-p19.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.iv-p20"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. vii. 4" id="v.iv-p20.1" parsed="|1Cor|7|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.7.4">1 Cor.
vii. 4</scripRef>.</p></note> much more
they who live in Christ must be unable to have authority over their
body. He who is now despised, the same will then be our judge;
think ever on Him and the river of fire: “For a river of fire”
we read, “winds before His face;”<note place="end" n="321" id="v.iv-p20.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.iv-p21"> <scripRef passage="Dan. vii. 10" id="v.iv-p21.1" parsed="|Dan|7|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Dan.7.10">Dan. vii.
10</scripRef>.</p></note> for it is impossible for one who
has been delivered over by Him to the fire to expect any end of his
punishment. But the unseemly pleasures of this life no-wise differ
from shadows and dreams; for before the deed of sin is completed,
the conditions of pleasure are extinguished; and the punishments
for these have no limit. And the sweetness lasts for a little while
but the pain is everlasting.</p>

<p class="c10" id="v.iv-p22">Tell me, what is there stable in this world?
Wealth which often does not last even to the evening? Or glory?

dash away before they stand still, even so does this glory take to
flight before it has fairly reached us. Nothing is more precious
than the soul; and even they who have gone to the extremity of
folly have not been ignorant of this; for “there is no equivalent
of the soul” is the saying of a heathen poet.<note place="end" n="323" id="v.iv-p23.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.iv-p24"> Homer Il. ix. 401.</p></note> I know that thou hast become much
weaker for the struggle with the Evil One; I know that thou art
standing in the very midst of the flame of pleasures; but if thou
wilt say to the enemy “We do not serve thy pleasures, and we do
not bow down to the root of all thy evils;” if thou wilt bend
thine eye upward, the Saviour will even now shake out the fire, and
will burn up those who have flung thee into it, and will send to
thee in the midst of the furnace a cloud, and dew, and a rustling
breeze, so that the fire may not lay hold of thy thought or thy
conscience. Only do not consume thyself with fire. For the arms and
engines of besiegers have often been unable to destroy the
fortification of cities, but the treachery of one or two of the
citizens dwelling inside has betrayed them to the enemy without any
trouble on his part. And now if none of thy thoughts within betray
thee, should the Evil One bring countless engines against thee from
without he will bring them in vain.</p>

<p class="c10" id="v.iv-p25">4. Thou hast by the grace of God many and
great men who sympathize with thy trouble, who encourage you to the
fight, who tremble for thy soul,—Valerius the holy man of God,
Florentius who is in every respect his brother, Porphyrius who is
wise with the wisdom of Christ, and many others. These are daily
mourning, and praying for you without ceasing; and they would have
obtained what they asked for, long ago, if only thou hadst been
willing to withdraw thyself a little space out of the hands of the
enemy. Now then is it not strange that, whilst others do not even
now despair of thy salvation, but are continually praying that they
may have their member restored to them, thou thyself, having once
fallen, art unwilling to get up again, and remainest prostrate, all
but crying aloud to the enemy: “Slay me, smite me, spare not?”
“Does he who falls not rise up again?”<note place="end" n="324" id="v.iv-p25.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.iv-p26"> <scripRef passage="Jer. viii. 4" id="v.iv-p26.1" parsed="|Jer|8|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Jer.8.4">Jer. viii.
4</scripRef>.</p></note> speaks the divine oracle. But thou
art striving against this and contradicting it; for if one who has
fallen despairs it is as much as to say that he who falls does not
rise up again. I entreat thee do not so great a wrong to thyself;
do not pour upon us such a flood of sorrow. I do not say at the
present time, when thou hast not yet completed thy twentieth year,
but even if, after achieving many things, and spending thy whole
life in Christ thou hadst, in extreme old age, experienced this
attack, even then it would not have been right to despair, but to
call to mind the robber who was justified on the cross, the
labourers who wrought about the eleventh hour, and received the
wages of the whole day. But as it is not well that those who have
fallen near the very extremity of life should abandon hope, if they
be sober minded, so on the other hand it is not safe to feed upon
this hope, and say, “Here for a while, I will enjoy the sweets of
life, but afterwards, when I have worked for a short time, I shall
receive the wages of the whole working time. For I recollect
hearing you often say, when many were exhorting you to frequent the
schools;<note place="end" n="325" id="v.iv-p26.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.iv-p27"> <i>i.e</i>., schools of Pagan philosophy: probably
those over which Libanius presided in Antioch.</p></note> “But what

I depart to Him who has said ‘Delay not to turn to the Lord, nor
put off day after day?’”<note place="end" n="326" id="v.iv-p27.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.iv-p28"> <scripRef passage="Ecclesiasticus 5.8" id="v.iv-p28.1" parsed="|Sir|5|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Sir.5.8">Ecclus. v. 8</scripRef>.</p></note> Recover this thought, and stand in
fear of the thief; for by this name Christ calls our departure
hence, because it comes upon us unawares. Consider the anxieties of
life which befall us, both those which are personal to ourselves,
and which are common to us with others, the fear of rulers, the
envy of citizens, the danger which 
<pb n="115" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_115.html" id="v.iv-Page_115" />often hangs over us imperilling even life itself,
the labours, the distresses, the servile flatteries, such as are
unbecoming even to slaves if they be earnest minded men, the fruit
of our labours coming to an end in this world, a fact which is the
most distressing of all. It has been the lot indeed of many to miss
the enjoyment of the things for which they have laboured, and after
having consumed the prime of their manhood in labours and perils,
just when they hoped that they should receive their reward they
have departed taking nothing with them. For if, after undergoing
many dangers, and completing many campaigns, one will scarcely look
upon an earthly king with confidence, how will any one be able to
behold the heavenly king, if he has lived and fought for another
all his time.</p>

<p class="c10" id="v.iv-p29">5. Would you have me speak of the domestic
cares of wife, and children and slaves? It is an evil thing to wed
a very poor wife, or a very rich one; for the former is injurious
to the husband’s means, the latter to his authority and
independence. It is a grievous thing to have children, still more
grievous not to have any; for in the latter case marriage has been
to no purpose, in the former a bitter bondage has to be undergone.
If a child is sick, it is the occasion of no small fear; if he dies
an untimely death, there is inconsolable grief; and at every stage
of growth there are various anxieties on their account, and many
fears and toils. And what is one to say to the rascalities of
domestic slaves? Is this then life, Theodore, when one’s soul is
distracted in so many directions, when a man has to serve so many,
to live for so many, and never for himself? Now amongst us, O
friend, none of these things happen, I appeal to yourself as a
witness. For during that short time when you were willing to lift
your head above the waves of this world, you know what great
cheerfulness and gladness you enjoyed. For there is no man free,
save only he who lives for Christ. He stands superior to all
troubles, and if he does not choose to injure himself no one else
will be able to do this, but he is impregnable; he is not stung by
the loss of wealth; for he has learned that we “brought nothing
into this world, neither can we carry anything out;”<note place="end" n="327" id="v.iv-p29.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.iv-p30"> <scripRef passage="1 Tim. vi. 7" id="v.iv-p30.1" parsed="|1Tim|6|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.6.7">1 Tim. vi.

provokes him by blows; there is only one calamity for a Christian
which is, disobedience to God; but all the other things, such as
loss of property, exile, peril of life, he does not even reckon to
be a grievance at all. And that which all dread, departure hence to
the other world,—this is to him sweeter than life itself. For as
when one has climbed to the top of a cliff and gazes on the sea and
those who are sailing upon it, he sees some being washed by the
waves, others running upon hidden rocks, some hurrying in one
direction, others being driven in another, like prisoners, by the
force of the gale, many actually in the water, some of them using
their hands only in the place of a boat and a rudder, and many
drifting along upon a single plank, or some fragment of the vessel,
others floating dead, a scene of manifold and various disaster;
even so he who is engaged in the service of Christ drawing himself
out of the turmoil and stormy billows of life takes his seat upon
secure and lofty ground. For what position can be loftier or more
secure than that in which a man has only one anxiety, “How he
ought to please God?”<note place="end" n="329" id="v.iv-p31.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.iv-p32"> <scripRef passage="1 Thess. iv. 1" id="v.iv-p32.1" parsed="|1Thess|4|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Thess.4.1">1 Thess.

Theodore, of those who sail upon this sea? Wherefore, I beseech
thee, avoid the deep water, avoid the stormy billows, and seize
some lofty spot where it is not possible to be captured. There is a

which awaits us when we have gone out of this world; “we must all
stand before the judgment-seat of Christ.”<note place="end" n="330" id="v.iv-p32.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.iv-p33"> <scripRef passage="Rom. xiv. 10" id="v.iv-p33.1" parsed="|Rom|14|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.14.10">Rom. xiv.

threatened with hell fire, it is not without purpose that such
great blessings have been prepared for us. The things of this life
are a shadow, and more naught even than a shadow, being full of
many fears, and many dangers, and extreme bondage. Do not then
deprive thyself both of that world, and of this, when you may gain
both, if you please. Now that they who live in Christ will gain the
things of this world Paul teaches us when he says: “But I spare
you;”<note place="end" n="331" id="v.iv-p33.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.iv-p34"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. vii. 28" id="v.iv-p34.1" parsed="|1Cor|7|28|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.7.28">1 Cor.

cares for the things of the Lord is superior to the man who has

<p class="c10" id="v.iv-p36">Be always thinking of these things, and break in
pieces the sharp sword of the Evil One, by means of which he
destroys many. And this is despair, which cuts off from hope those
who have been overthrown. This is the strong weapon of the enemy,
and the only way in which he holds down those who have been made
captives is by binding them with this chain, which, if we choose,
we shall speedily be able to break by the grace of God. I know that
I have exceeded the due measure of a 
<pb n="116" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_116.html" id="v.iv-Page_116" />letter, but forgive me; for I am not
willingly in this condition, but have been constrained by my love
and sorrow, owing to which I forced myself to write this letter
also,<note place="end" n="333" id="v.iv-p36.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.iv-p37"> This seems to imply a previous letter.</p></note> although
many would have prevented me. “Cease labouring in vain and sowing
upon rock” many have been saying to me. But I hearkened to none
of them. For there is hope I said to myself that, God willing, my
letter will accomplish something; but if that which we deprecate
should take place, we shall at least have the advantage of escaping
self reproach for keeping silence, and we shall not be worse than
sailors on the sea, who, when they behold men of their own craft
drifting on a plank, because their ship has been broken to pieces
by the winds and waves, take down their sails, and cast anchor, and
get into a boat and try to rescue the men, although strangers,
known to them only in consequence of their calamity. But if the
others were unwilling to be rescued no one would accuse those of
their destruction who attempted to save them. This is what we
offer; but we trust that by the grace of God you also will do your
part, and we shall again see you occupying an eminent place in the
flock of Christ. In answer to the prayers of the saints may we
speedily receive thee back, dear friend, sound in the true health.
If thou hast any regard for us, and hast not utterly cast us out of
thy memory, please vouchsafe a reply to our letter; for in so doing
thou wilt give us much pleasure.</p>

<p class="c9" id="vi.ii-p2"><span class="c12" id="vi.ii-p2.1">The</span> date of the
following letter can be determined within very narrow limits. It
contains a reference (c. 5) to the defeat and death of the Emperor
Valens in the battle with the Goths at Hadrianople, in <span class="c12" id="vi.ii-p2.2">a.d.</span> 378, as a recent event. The Emperor who is
described as having incessantly engaged in war ever since his
accession (c. 4) must be Theodosius, who succeeded Valens, and as
the Goths are said to be still overrunning large regions with
impunity, and insolently mocking the timidity of the imperial
troops (ib.) the letter must have been written prior to the
crushing defeat which Theodosius inflicted on them in 382. The
whole epistle is deeply tinged with that profound sense of the
unhappiness and instability of human life which the moral
corruption of society and recent calamities of the empire impressed
with peculiar force on the minds of men; producing too often
amongst Pagans either a cynical gloom or reckless indifference, but
leading Christians to cling more closely and earnestly to the hopes
and consolations of the Gospel.</p>

<p class="c33" id="vi.iii-p2">————————————</p>

<p class="c9" id="vi.iii-p3">1. <span class="c12" id="vi.iii-p3.1">That</span> you have
sustained a severe blow, and that the weapon directed from above
has been planted in a vital part all will readily admit, and none
even of the most rigid moralists will deny it; but since they who
are stricken with sorrow ought not to spend their whole time in
mourning and tears, but to make good provision also for the healing
of their wounds, lest, if they be neglected their tears should
aggravate the wound, and the fire of their sorrow become inflamed,
it is a good thing to listen to words of consolation, and
restraining for a brief season at least the fountain of thy tears
to surrender thyself to those who endeavour to console thee. On
this account I abstained from troubling you when your sorrow was at
its height, and the thunderbolt had only just fallen upon you; but
having waited an interval and permitted you to take your fill of
mourning, now that you are able to look out a little through the
mist, and to open your ears to those who attempt to comfort you, I
also would second the words of your handmaids by some contributions
of my own. For whilst the tempest is still severe, and a full gale
of sorrow is blowing, he who exhorts another to desist from grief
would only provoke him to increased lamentations and having
incurred his hatred would add fuel to the flame by such speeches
besides being regarded himself as an unkind and foolish person. But
when the troubled water has begun to subside, and God has allayed
the fury of the waves, then we may freely spread the sails of our
discourse. For in a moderate storm skill may perhaps play its part;
but when the onslaught of the wind is irresistible experience is of
no avail. For these reasons I have hitherto held my peace, and even
now have only just ventured to break silence because I have heard
from thy uncle that one may begin to take courage, as some of your
more esteemed handmaids are now venturing to discourse at length
upon these matters, women also outside your own household, who are
your kinsfolk, or are otherwise qualified for this office. Now if
you allow them to talk to you I have the greatest hope and
confidence that you will not disdain my words but do your best to
give them a calm and quiet hearing. Under any circumstances indeed
the female sex is the more apt to be sensitive to suffering; but
when in addition there is youth, and untimely widowhood, and
inexperience in business, and a great crowd of cares, while the
whole life previously has been nurtured in the midst of luxury, and
cheerfulness and wealth, the evil is increased many fold, and if
she who is subjected to it does not obtain help from on high even
an accidental thought will be able to unhinge her. Now I hold this
to be the foremost and greatest evidence of God’s care concerning
thee; for that thou hast not been overwhelmed by grief, nor driven
out of thy natural condition of mind when such great troubles
suddenly concurred to afflict thee was not due to any human
assistance but to the almighty hand the understanding of which
there is no measure, the wisdom which is past finding out, the
“Father of mercies and the God of all comfort.”<note place="end" n="334" id="vi.iii-p3.2"><p class="endnote" id="vi.iii-p4"> <scripRef passage="2 Cor. i. 3" id="vi.iii-p4.1" parsed="|2Cor|1|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.1.3">2 Cor. i.

Himself” it is said “hath smitten us, and He will heal us; He
will strike, and He will dress the wound and make us whole.”<note place="end" n="335" id="vi.iii-p4.2"><p class="endnote" id="vi.iii-p5"> <scripRef passage="Hosea vi. 2" id="vi.iii-p5.1" parsed="|Hos|6|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Hos.6.2">Hosea vi.

<p class="c10" id="vi.iii-p6">For as long as that blessed husband of thine
was with thee, thou didst enjoy honour, and care and zealous
attention; in fact you enjoyed such as you might expect to enjoy
from a husband; but since God took him to Himself He has supplied
his place to thee. And this is not my saying but that of the
blessed prophet David for he says “He will take up the fatherless
and the widow,”<note place="end" n="336" id="vi.iii-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="vi.iii-p7"> <scripRef passage="Ps. cxlvi. 9" id="vi.iii-p7.1" parsed="|Ps|46|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.46.9">Ps. cxlvi.
9</scripRef>.</p></note> and
elsewhere <pb n="122" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_122.html" id="vi.iii-Page_122" />he calls
Him “father of the fatherless and judge of the widow;”<note place="end" n="337" id="vi.iii-p7.2"><p class="endnote" id="vi.iii-p8"> <scripRef passage="Ps. lxviii. 5" id="vi.iii-p8.1" parsed="|Ps|68|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.68.5">Ps.
lxviii. 5</scripRef>.</p></note> thus in many
passages thou wilt see that He earnestly considereth the cause of
this class of mankind.</p>

<p class="c10" id="vi.iii-p9">2. But lest the continual repetition of this
name of widow should upset thy soul, and disconcert thy reason,
having been inflicted on thee in the very flower of thy age, I wish
first of all to discourse on this point, and to prove to you that
this name of widow is not a title of calamity but of honour, aye
the greatest honour. For do not quote the erroneous opinion of the
world as a testimony, but the admonition of the blessed Paul, or
rather of Christ. For in his utterances Christ was speaking through
him as he himself said “If ye seek a proof of Christ who is
speaking in me?”<note place="end" n="338" id="vi.iii-p9.1"><p class="endnote" id="vi.iii-p10"> <scripRef passage="2 Cor. xiii. 3" id="vi.iii-p10.1" parsed="|2Cor|13|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.13.3">2 Cor.
xiii. 3</scripRef>.</p></note> What then does he say? “Let not a
widow be enrolled under threescore years of age” and again “but
the younger widows refuse”<note place="end" n="339" id="vi.iii-p10.2"><p class="endnote" id="vi.iii-p11"> <scripRef passage="1 Tim. v. 9, 11" id="vi.iii-p11.1" parsed="|1Tim|5|9|0|0;|1Tim|5|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.5.9 Bible:1Tim.5.11">1 Tim. v.
9, 11</scripRef>.</p></note> intending by both these sayings to
indicate to us the importance of the matter. And when he is making
regulations about bishops he nowhere prescribes a standard of age,
but in this case he is very particular on the point, and, pray, why
so? not because widowhood is greater than priesthood, but because
widows have greater labour to undergo than priests, being
encompassed on many sides by a variety of business public and
private. For as an unfortified city lies exposed to all who wish to
plunder it, so a young woman living in widowhood has many who form
designs upon her on every side not only those who aim at getting
her money but also those who are bent upon corrupting her modesty.
And besides these we shall find that she is subjected to other
conditions also likely to occasion her fall. For the contempt of
servants their negligence of business, the loss of that respect
which was formerly paid, the sight of contemporaries in prosperity,
and often the hankering after luxury, induce women to engage in a
second marriage. Some there are who do not choose to unite
themselves to men by the law of marriage, but do so secretly and
clandestinely. And they act thus in order to enjoy the praise of
widowhood; thus it is a state which seems to be not reproached, but
admired and deemed worthy of honour among men, not only amongst us
who believe, but even amongst unbelievers also. For once when I was
still a young man I know that the sophist who taught me<note place="end" n="340" id="vi.iii-p11.2"><p class="endnote" id="vi.iii-p12"> Libanius.</p></note> (and he
exceeded all men in his reverence for the gods) expressed
admiration for my mother before a large company. For enquiring, as
was his wont, of those who sat beside him who I was, and some one
having said that I was the son of a woman who was a widow, he asked
of me the age of my mother and the duration of her widowhood, and
when I told him that she was forty years of age of which twenty had
elapsed since she lost my father he was astonished and uttered a
loud exclamation, and turning to those present “Heavens!” cried
he “what women there are amongst the Christians.” So great is
the admiration and praise enjoyed by widowhood not only amongst
ourselves, but also a amongst those who are outside the Church. And
being aware of all this the blessed Paul said “Let not a widow be
enrolled under threescore years of age.” And even after this
great qualification of age he does not permit her to be ranked in
this sacred society but mentions some additional requisites “well
reported of for good works, if she have brought up children if she
have lodged strangers if she have washed the saints feet if she
have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every
good work.”<note place="end" n="341" id="vi.iii-p12.1"><p class="endnote" id="vi.iii-p13"> <scripRef passage="1 Tim. v. 10" id="vi.iii-p13.1" parsed="|1Tim|5|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.5.10">1 Tim. v.
10</scripRef>.</p></note> Heavens!
what testing and scrutiny! how much virtue does he demand from the
widow, and how precisely does he define it! which he would not have
done, had he not intended to entrust to her a position of honour
and dignity. And “the younger widows” he says “refuse;” and
then he adds the reason: “for when they have waxed wanton against
Christ they will marry.”<note place="end" n="342" id="vi.iii-p13.2"><p class="endnote" id="vi.iii-p14"> <scripRef passage="1 Tim. v. 11" id="vi.iii-p14.1" parsed="|1Tim|5|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.5.11">1 Tim. v.
11</scripRef>.</p></note> By this expression he gives us to
understand that they who have lost their husbands are wedded to
Christ in their stead. Observe how he asserts this by way of
indicating the mild and easy nature of this union; I refer to the
passage “when they have waxed wanton against Christ they will
marry,” as if He were some gentle husband who did not exercise
authority over them, but suffered them to live in freedom. Neither
did Paul confine his discourse on the subject to these remarks, but
also in another place again he has manifested great anxiety about
it where he says “Now she who liveth in pleasure is dead while
she liveth; but she who is a widow indeed and desolate hath set her
hope in God, and continueth in prayers and supplications day and
night.”<note place="end" n="343" id="vi.iii-p14.2"><p class="endnote" id="vi.iii-p15"> <scripRef passage="1 Tim. v. 6, 5" id="vi.iii-p15.1" parsed="|1Tim|5|6|0|0;|1Tim|5|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.5.6 Bible:1Tim.5.5">1 Tim. v.
6, 5</scripRef>.</p></note> And writing
to the Corinthians he says “But she is more blessed if she abide
thus.”<note place="end" n="344" id="vi.iii-p15.2"><p class="endnote" id="vi.iii-p16"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. vii. 40" id="vi.iii-p16.1" parsed="|1Cor|7|40|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.7.40">1 Cor.
vii. 40</scripRef>.</p></note> You see what
great praise is bestowed upon widowhood, and this in the New
Testament, when the beauty of virginity also was clearly brought to
light. Nevertheless even the lustre of this state could not obscure
the glories of widowhood, which shines on brightly all the same,
keeping its own value. When then we make mention of widowhood from
time to time, do not be cast down, nor consider the matter a
reproach; for if this <pb n="123" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_123.html" id="vi.iii-Page_123" />be
a matter of reproach, far more so is virginity. But this is not the
case; no! God forbid. For inasmuch as we all admire and welcome
women who live continently whilst their husbands are yet alive must
we not be delighted with those who manifest the same good feeling
concerning their husbands when they have departed this, life, and
praise them accordingly? As I was saying then, as long as you lived
with the blessed Therasius you enjoyed honour and consideration
such as is natural for a wife to receive from a husband; but now in
his place you have God who is the Lord of all, who hath of old been
thy protector and will be so now still more and with yet greater
earnestness; and as I have already said He hath displayed no slight
token of his providential care by having preserved thee whole and
unharmed in the midst of such a furnace of anxiety and sorrow, and
not suffering thee to undergo anything undesirable. Now if He has
not permitted any shipwreck to take place in the midst of so much
rough water, much more will He preserve thy soul in calm weather
and lighten the burden of thy widowhood, and the consequences of it
which seem to be so terrible.</p>

<p class="c10" id="vi.iii-p17">3. Now if it is not the name of widow which
distresses you, but the loss of such a husband I grant you that all
the world over amongst men engaged in secular affairs there have
been few like him, so affectionate, so gentle, so humble, so
sincere, so understanding, so devout. And certainly if he had
altogether perished, and utterly ceased to be, it would be right to
be distressed, and sorrowful; but if he has only sailed into the
tranquil haven, and taken his journey to Him who is really his
king, one ought not to mourn but to rejoice on these accounts. For
this death is not death, but only a kind of emigration and
translation from the worse to the better, from earth to heaven,
from men to angels, and archangels, and Him who is the Lord of
angels and archangels. For here on earth whilst he was serving the
emperor there were dangers to be expected and many plots arising
from men who bore ill-will, for in proportion as his reputation
increased did the designs also of enemies abound; but now that he
has departed to the other world none of these things can be
suspected. Wherefore in proportion as you grieve that God has taken
away one who was so good and worthy you ought to rejoice that he
has departed in much safety and honour, and being released from the
trouble which besets this present season of danger, is in great
peace and tranquillity. For is it not out of place to acknowledge
that heaven is far better than earth, and yet to mourn those who
are translated from this world to the other? For if that blessed
husband of thine had been one of those who lived a shameful life
contrary to what God approved it would have been right to bewail
and lament for him not only when he had departed, but whilst he was
still living; but inasmuch as he was one of those who are the
friends of God we should take pleasure in him not only whilst
living, but also when he has been laid to rest. And that we ought
to act thus thou hast surely heard the words of the blessed Paul
“to depart and to be with Christ which is far better.”<note place="end" n="345" id="vi.iii-p17.1"><p class="endnote" id="vi.iii-p18"> <scripRef passage="Phil. i. 33" id="vi.iii-p18.1" parsed="|Phil|1|33|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Phil.1.33">Phil. i.
33</scripRef>.</p></note> But perhaps
you long to hear your husband’s words, and enjoy the affection
which you bestowed upon him, and you yearn for his society, and the
glory which you had on his account, and the splendour, and honour,
and security, and all these things being gone distress and darken
your life. Well! the affection which you be stowed on him you can
keep now just as you formerly did.</p>

<p class="c10" id="vi.iii-p19">For such is the power of love, it embraces, and
unites, and fastens together not only those who are present, and
near, and visible but also those who are far distant; and neither
length of time, nor separation in space, nor anything else of that
kind can break up and sunder in pieces the affection of the soul.
But if you wish to behold him face to face (for this I know is what
you specially long for) keep thy bed in his honour sacred from the
touch of any other man, and do thy best to manifest a life like
his, and then assuredly thou shalt depart one day to join the same
company with him, not to dwell with him for five years as thou
didst here, nor for 20, or 100, nor for a thousand or twice that
number but for infinite and endless ages. For it is not any
physical relation, but a correspondence in the way of living which
qualifies for the inheritance of those regions of rest. For if it
was identity of moral constitution which brought Lazarus although a
stranger to Abraham into the same heavenly bosom with him, and
qualifies many from east and west to sit down with him, the place
of rest will receive thee also with the good Therasius, if thou
wilt exhibit the same manner of life as his, and then thou shalt
receive him back again no longer in that corporeal beauty which he
had when he departed, but in lustre of another kind, and splendour
outshining the rays of the sun. For this body, even if it reaches a
very high standard of beauty is nevertheless perishable; but the
bodies of those who have been well pleasing to God, will be
invested with such glory as these eyes cannot even look upon. And
God has furnished us with certain tokens, and obscure indications
of these things both in the Old and in the New 
<pb n="124" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_124.html" id="vi.iii-Page_124" />Dispensation. For in the former the face of Moses
shone with such glory as to be intolerable to the eyes of the
Israelites, and in the New the face of Christ shone far more
brilliantly than his. For tell me if any one had promised to make
your husband king of all the earth, and then had commanded you to
withdraw for twenty years on his account, and had promised after
that to restore him to you with the diadem and the purple, and to
place you again in the same rank with him, would you not have
meekly endured the separation with due self-control? Would you not
have been well pleased with the gift, and deemed it a thing worth
praying for? Well then submit to this now, not for the sake of a
kingdom on earth, but of a kingdom in Heaven; not to receive him
back clad in a vesture of gold but robed in immortality and glory
such as is fitting for them to have who dwell in Heaven. And if you
find the trial very unbearable owing to its long duration, it may
be that he will visit you by means of visions and converse with you
as he was wont to do, and show you the face for which you yearn:
let this be thy consolation taking the place of letters, though
indeed it is far more definite than letters. For in the latter case
there are but lines traced with the pen to look upon, but in the
former you see the form of his visage, and his gentle smile, his
figure and his movements, you hear his speech and recognize the
voice which you loved so well.</p>

<p class="c10" id="vi.iii-p20">4. But since you mourn also over the loss of
security which you formerly enjoyed on his account, and perhaps
also for the sake of those great hopes of distinction which were
dawning (for I used to hear that he would speedily arrive at the
dignity of præfect, and this, I fancy, it is which more especially
upsets and distresses thy soul) consider I pray the case of those
who have been in a higher official position than his, and yet have
brought their life to a very pitiable end. Let me recall them to
your memory: you probably know Theodore of Sicily by reputation:<note place="end" n="346" id="vi.iii-p20.1"><p class="endnote" id="vi.iii-p21"> According to Ammianus Marcellinus, B. xxxiv., this
Theodore was a native of Gaul. He is probably called Theodore of
Sicily by Chrysostom because he attempted to make himself a tyrant
in that island. He was executed for treason in the year 371.</p></note> for he was
one of the most distinguished men; he surpassed all in bodily
stature and beauty as well as in the confidence which he enjoyed
with the Emperor, and he had more power than any member of the
royal household, but he did not bear this prosperity meekly, and
having entered into a plot against the Emperor he was taken
prisoner and miserably beheaded; and his wife who was not a whit
inferior to thy noble self in education and birth and all other
respects was suddenly stripped of all her possessions, deprived
even of her freedom also, and enrolled amongst the household
slaves, and compelled to lead a life more pitiable than any
bondmaid, having this advantage only over the rest that owing to
the extreme severity of her calamity she moved to tears all who
beheld her. And it is said also that Artemisia who was the wife of
a man of high reputation, since he also aimed at usurping the
throne, was reduced to this same condition of poverty, and also to
blindness; for the depth of her despondency, and the abundance of
her tears destroyed her sight; and now she has need of persons to
lead her by the hand, and to conduct her to the doors of others
that she may obtain the necessary supply of food.<note place="end" n="347" id="vi.iii-p21.1"><p class="endnote" id="vi.iii-p22"> I have not been able to discover any further
information concerning Artemisia or her husband.</p></note> And I might mention many other
families which have been brought down in this way did I not know
thee to be too pious and prudent in disposition to wish to find
consolation for thy own calamity out of the misfortunes of others.
And the only reason why I mentioned those instances to which I
referred just now was that you might learn that human things are
nothingness but that truly as the prophet says “all the glory of
man is as the flower of grass.”<note place="end" n="348" id="vi.iii-p22.1"><p class="endnote" id="vi.iii-p23"> <scripRef passage="Is. xl. 5" id="vi.iii-p23.1" parsed="|Isa|40|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.40.5">Is. xl.
5</scripRef>.</p></note> For in proportion to men’s
elevation and splendour is the ruin wrought for them, not only in
the case of those who are under rule, but also of the rulers
themselves. For it would be impossible to find any private family
which has been immersed in such great calamities as the ills in
which the imperial house has been steeped. For untimely loss of
parents, and of husbands, and violent forms of death, more
outrageous and painful than those which occur in tragedies,
especially beset this kind of government.</p>

who although slaughtered more easily than sheep still expect to
conquer, and are not willing to quit their own country; for he said
that he himself was satiated with the work of cutting them to
pieces. Imagine what the feelings of the Emperor and his wife must
be on hearing these words!</p>

<p class="c10" id="vi.iii-p36">5. And since I have made mention of this war, a
great crowd of widows has occurred to me, who in past times derived
very great lustre from the honour enjoyed by their husbands, but
now are all arrayed in a dark mourning robe and spend their whole
time in lamentation. For they had not the advantage which was
enjoyed by thy dear self. For thou, my excellent friend, didst see
that goodly husband of thine lying on his bed, and didst hear his
last words, and receive his instructions as to what should be done
about the affairs of the family, and learn how by the provisions of
his will they were guarded against every kind of encroachment on
the part of rapacious and designing men. And not only this, but
also when he was yet lying dead thou didst often fling thyself upon
the body, and kiss his eyes, and embrace him, and wail over him,
and thou didst see him conducted to burial with much honour, and
didst everything necessary for his obsequies, as was fitting, and
from frequent visits to his grave thou hast no slight consolation
of thy sorrow. But these women have been deprived of all these
things, having all sent out their husbands to war in the hope of
receiving them back again, instead of which it has been their lot
to receive the bitter tidings of their death. Neither has any one
come back to them with the bodies of their slain, or bringing
anything save a message describing the manner of their death. And
some there are who have not even been vouchsafed this record, or
been enabled to learn how their husbands fell, as they were buried
beneath a heap of slain in the thick of battle.</p>

<p class="c10" id="vi.iii-p37">And what wonder if most of the generals
perished thus, when even the Emperor himself having been blockaded
in a certain village with a few soldiers did not dare to go out and
oppose the assailants, but remained inside and when the enemy had
set fire to the building was burnt to death together with all that
were therein, not men only, but horses, beams and walls, so that
the whole was turned into a heap of ashes? And this was the tale
which they who departed to war with the Emperor brought back to his
wife in place of the Emperor himself.<note place="end" n="358" id="vi.iii-p37.1"><p class="endnote" id="vi.iii-p38"> The best account of the destruction of the Emperor
Valens and his army in the battle of Hadrianople A.D. 378, is to be
found in Hodgkin’s “Italy and her Invaders,” vol. i. pp.
120–6 (Clarendon Press, Oxford).</p></note> For the splendours of the world
differ in no-wise whatever from the things which happen on the
stage, and the beauty of spring flowers. For in the first place
they flee away before they have been manifested; and then, even if
they have strength to last a little while, they speedily become
ready to decay. For what is more worthless than the honour and
glory which is paid by the multitude? what fruit has it? what kind
of profit? what serviceable end does it meet? And would that this
only was the evil! but in fact besides failing to get anything good
from the possession, he who owns this most cruel mistress is
continually forced to bear much which is painful and injurious; for
mistress she is of those who own her, and in proportion as she is
flattered by her slaves does she exalt herself against them, and
ties them down by increasingly harsh commands; but she would never
be able to revenge herself on those who despise and neglect her; so
much fiercer is she than any tyrant and wild beast. For tyrants and
wild animals are often mollified by humouring, but her fury is
greatest when we are most complaisant to her, and if she finds any
one who will listen to her, and yield to her in everything there is
no kind of command from which in future she can be induced to
abstain. <pb n="126" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_126.html" id="vi.iii-Page_126" />Moreover she
has also another ally whom one would not do wrong to call her
daughter. For after she herself has grown to maturity and fairly
taken root amongst us, she then produces arrogance, a thing which
is no less able than herself to drive the soul of those who possess
it into headlong ruin.</p>

<p class="c10" id="vi.iii-p39">6. Tell me then dost thou lament this that God hath
reserved thee from such a cruel bondage, and that He has barred
every avenue against these pestilential diseases? For whilst thy
husband was living they ceased not continually assaulting the
thoughts of thy heart, but since his death they have no starting
point whence they can lay hold of thy understanding. This then is a
discipline which ought to be practised in future—to abstain from
lamenting the withdrawal of these evils, and from hankering after
the bitter tyranny which they exercise. For where they blow a heavy
blast they upset all things from the foundation and shatter them to
pieces; and just as many prostitutes, although by nature ill
favoured and ugly, do yet by means of enamels and pigments excite
the feelings of the youthful whilst they are still tender, and when
they have got them under their control treat them more insolently
than any slave; so also do these passions, vainglory and arrogance,
defile the souls of men more than any other kind of pollution.</p>

<p class="c10" id="vi.iii-p40">On this account also wealth has seemed to the
majority of men to be a good thing; at least when it is stripped of
this passion of vainglory it will no longer seem desirable. At any
rate those who have been permitted to obtain in the midst of their
poverty popular glory have no longer preferred wealth, but rather
have despised much gold when it was bestowed upon them. And you
have no need to learn from me who these men were, for you know them
better than I do, Epaminondas, Socrates, Aristeides, Diogenes,
Krates who turned his own land into a sheep walk.<note place="end" n="359" id="vi.iii-p40.1"><p class="endnote" id="vi.iii-p41"> Krates was a cynic philosopher, a disciple of
Diogenes. He flourished about 330 B.C. He was heir to a large
fortune, but bestowed the whole of it upon his native city Thebes.
Diogenes Laertius relates many curious stories about him.</p></note> The others indeed, inasmuch as it
was not possible for them to get rich, saw glory brought to them in
the midst of their poverty, and straightway devoted themselves to
it, but this man threw away even what he possessed; so infatuated
were they in the pursuit of this cruel monster. Let us not then
weep because God has rescued us from this shameful thraldom which
is an object of derision and of much reproach; for there is nothing
splendid in it save the name it bears, and in reality it places
those who possess it in a position which belies its appellation,
and there is no one who does not laugh to scorn the man who does
anything with a view to glory. For it is only he who has not an eye
to this who will be enabled to win respect and glory; but he who
sets a great value on popular glory, and does and endures
everything for the sake of obtaining it is the very man who will
fail to attain it, and be subjected to all the exact opposites of
glory, ridicule, and accusation, scoffing, enmity and hatred. And
this is wont to happen not only among men, but also among you
women, and indeed more especially in your case. For the woman who
is unaffected in mien, and gait, and dress, and seeks no honour
from any one is admired by all women, and they are ecstatic in
their praise and call her blessed, and invoke all manner of good
things upon her; but a vain-glorious woman they behold with
aversion and detestation, and avoid her like some wild beast and
load her with infinite execrations and abuse. And not only do we
escape these evils by refusing to accept popular glory, but we
shall gain the highest advantages in addition to those which have
been already mentioned, being trained gradually to loosen our hold
of earth and move in the direction of heaven, and despise all
worldly things. For he who feels no need of the honour which comes
from men, will perform with security whatever good things he does,
and neither in the troubles, nor in the prosperities of this life
will he be very seriously affected; for neither can the former
depress him, and cast him down, nor can the latter elate and puff
him up, but in precarious and troubled circumstances he himself
remains exempt from change of any kind. And this I expect will
speedily be the case with your own soul, and having once for all
torn yourself away from all worldly interests you will display
amongst us a heavenly manner of life, and in a little while will
laugh to scorn the glory which you now lament, and despise its
hollow and vain mask. But if you long for the security which you
formerly enjoyed owing to your husband, and the protection of your
property, and immunity from the designs of any of those persons who
trample upon the misfortunes of others “Cast thy care upon the
Lord and He will nourish thee.”<note place="end" n="360" id="vi.iii-p41.1"><p class="endnote" id="vi.iii-p42"> <scripRef passage="Ps. lv. 23" id="vi.iii-p42.1" parsed="|Ps|55|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.55.23">Ps. lv.

has alleviated this intolerable calamity, and placed you even now
in a state of tranquillity will also avert impending evils; for
that you will never receive another blow more severe than this you
would yourself admit. 
<pb n="127" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_127.html" id="vi.iii-Page_127" />Having then so bravely borne present troubles,
and this when you were inexperienced, you will far more easily
endure future events should any of the things contrary to our
wishes, which God forbid, occur. Therefore seek Heaven, and all
things which conduce to life in the other world, and none of the
things here will be able to harm thee, not even the world-ruler of
darkness himself, if only we do not injure ourselves. For if any
one deprives us of our substance, or hews our body in pieces, none
of these things concern us, if our soul abides in its
integrity.</p>

<p class="c10" id="vi.iii-p44">7. Now, once for all, if you wish your property to
abide with you in security and yet further to increase I will show
thee the plan, and the place where none of those who have designs
upon it will be allowed to enter. What then is the place? It is
Heaven. Send away thy possessions to that good husband of thine and
neither thief, nor schemer, nor any other destructive thing will be
able to pounce upon them. If you deposit these goods in the other
world, you will find much profit arising from them. For all things
which we plant in Heaven yield a large and abundant crop, such as
might naturally be expected from things which have their roots in
Heaven. And if you do this, see what blessings you will enjoy, in
the first place eternal life and the things promised to those who
love God, “which eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have
they entered into the heart of man,” and in the second place
perpetual intercourse with thy good husband; and you will relieve
yourself from the cares and fears, and dangers, and designs, and
enmity and hatred which beset you here. For as long as you are
surrounded with this property there will probably be some to make
attempts upon it; but if you transfer it to Heaven, you will lead a
life of security and safety, and much tranquillity, enjoying
independence combined with godliness. For it is very irrational,
when one wishes to buy land, and is seeking for productive ground,
if, Heaven being proposed to him instead of earth, and the
possibility presented of obtaining an estate there he abides still
on earth, and puts up with the toils that are connected with it;
for it often disappoints our hopes.</p>

<p class="c10" id="vi.iii-p45">But since thy soul is grievously upset and
vexed on account of the expectation often entertained that thy
husband would attain the rank of prefect, and the thought that he
was untimely snatched away from that dignity consider first of all
this fact, that even if this hope was a very well grounded one
nevertheless it was only a human hope, which often falls to the
ground; and we see many things of this kind happening in life,
those which were confidently expected having remained unfulfilled,
whereas those which never even entered the mind have frequently
come to pass, and this we constantly see occurring everywhere in
cases of governments and kingdoms, and inheritances, and marriages.
Wherefore even if the opportunity were very near at hand, yet as
the proverb says “between the cup and the lip there is many a
slip” and the Scripture saith “from the morning until the
evening the time is changed.”<note place="end" n="362" id="vi.iii-p45.1"><p class="endnote" id="vi.iii-p46"> <scripRef passage="Ecclesiasticus 18.26" id="vi.iii-p46.1" parsed="|Sir|18|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Sir.18.26">Ecclus. xviii. 26</scripRef>.</p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="vi.iii-p47">So also a king who is here to-day is dead
tomorrow; and again this same wise man illustrating the reversal of
men’s hopes says “many tyrants have sat down upon the ground,
and one that was never thought of has worn the crown.”<note place="end" n="363" id="vi.iii-p47.1"><p class="endnote" id="vi.iii-p48"> <scripRef passage="Ecclesiasticus 11.5" id="vi.iii-p48.1" parsed="|Sir|11|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Sir.11.5">Ecclus. xi. 5</scripRef>.</p></note> And it was
not absolutely certain that if he lived he would arrive at this
dignity; for that which belongs to the future is uncertain, and
causes us to have various suspicions. For on what grounds was it
evident that had he lived he would have attained that dignity and
that things would not have turned out the other way, and that he
would have lost the office he actually held either from falling a
victim to disease, or from being exposed to the envy and ill will
of those who wished to excel him in prosperity, or from suffering
some other grievous misfortune. But let us suppose, if you please,
that it was perfectly evident that in any case had he survived he
would have obtained this high distinction; then in proportion to
the magnitude of the dignity would have been the increased dangers,
and anxieties, and intrigues which he must have encountered. Or put
these even on one side, and let us suppose him to traverse that sea
of difficulties safely, and in much tranquillity; then tell me what
is the goal? not that which he has now reached; no, not that, but
something different, probably unpleasant and undesirable. In the
first place his sight of heaven, and heavenly things would have
been delayed, which is no small loss to those who have put their
trust in things to come; and in the next place, even had he lived a
very pure life yet the length of his life and the exigencies of his
high office would have prevented his departing in such a pure
condition as has now been the case. In fact it is uncertain whether
he might not have undergone many changes and given way to indolence
before he breathed his last. For now we are confident that by the
grace of God he has taken his flight to the region of rest, because
he had not committed himself to any of those deeds which exclude
from the kingdom of Heaven; but in that case after long contact
with public busi<pb n="128" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_128.html" id="vi.iii-Page_128" />ness, he
might probably have contracted great defilement. For it is an
exceedingly rare thing for one who is moving in the midst of such
great evils to hold a straight course, but to go astray, both
wittingly and against his will, is a natural thing, and one which
constantly occurs. But, as it is, we have been relieved from this
apprehension, and we are firmly persuaded that in the great day he
will appear in much radiance, shining forth near the King, and
going with the angels in advance of Christ and clad with the robe
of unutterable glory, and standing by the side of the King as he
gives judgment, and acting as one of His chief ministers. Wherefore
desisting from mourning and lamentation do thou hold on to the same
way of life as his, yea even let it be more exact, that having
speedily attained an equal standard of virtue with him, you may
inhabit the same abode and be united to him again through the
everlasting ages, not in this union of marriage but another far
better. For this is only a bodily kind of intercourse, but then
there will be a union of soul with soul more perfect, and of a far
more delightful and far nobler kind.</p>

BABYLAS.</span></p>

<p class="c9" id="vii.ii-p2"><span class="c12" id="vii.ii-p2.1">The</span> following have
been selected out of a large number delivered by Chrysostom on the
festivals of saints and martyrs, not only because they are good
samples of his discourses on such occasions, but also on account of
the celebrity of the two saints in whose honour they were spoken.
There is really very little known about Ignatius beyond the fact
that he was Bishop of Antioch, and suffered martyrdom at Rome in
the reign of Trajan about the year 110 <span class="c12" id="vii.ii-p2.2">
a.d.</span>: being torn to death by wild beasts in the colossal
amphitheatre erected for the display of such inhuman sports by the
emperors of the Flavian dynasty. The tradition that he was a
disciple of St. John does not rest on any trustworthy evidence, but
on the other hand there is nothing inherently impossible or even
improbable in the supposition.</p>

<p class="c10" id="vii.ii-p3">According to a tradition which cannot be traced back
earlier than the latter part of the fourth century the reliques
were translated from Rome to Antioch and deposited in the Christian
cemetery outside the gates called the Daphnitic gate, because it
led from the city to the famous suburb of Daphne, on which we shall
have more to say presently. It is clear from the following eulogy
that Chrysostom accepted this tradition, and his repeated
invitation to his hearers to “come hither” to enjoy the
beneficent influence of the saint seems to imply that his discourse
was delivered in the “martyr,” that is the chapel erected to
contain the martyr’s remains, not in the “Great Church” of
Antioch where he commonly preached. In the next generation the
reliques of the saint were again translated by the Emperor, the
younger Theodosius, to the building which had been the temple of
the “Fortune of Antioch,” and then the illustrious Christian
martyr was substituted for the mythical goddess on the tutelary
genius of the city.</p>

<p id="vii.ii-p4">The fame of S. Babylas rivalled and for a time almost threatened
to overshadow that of S. Ignatius. He had been Bishop of Antioch
about 237 to 250. The heroic courage with which he had once
repulsed the Emperor Philip from the church until he should have
submitted to penance for some offence committed, and his martyrdom
in the persecution under Decius were his original claims to popular
veneration. But some later events shed a fresh lustre on his name.
In the year 351 the Cæsar Gallus, brother of Julian, being
resident in Antioch, transferred the reliques of Babylas from their
resting place within the city to the beautiful suburb the garden or
grove of Daphne. “In the history of this spot we have a singular
instance of the way in which Grecian legend was transplanted into
foreign soil. Daphne the daughter of the river-god Ladon were
according to the Syrian version of the myth, overtaken by her lover
Apollo near Antioch. Here it was, on the banks not of the Peneus
but of the Oronete, that the maiden prayed to her mother earth to
open her arms and shelter her from the pursuit of the amorous god,
and that the laurel plant sprang out of the spot where she vanished
from the eyes of her disappointed lover. The house of Seleucus
Nicator, founder of the Syrian monarchy was said to have struck his
hoof upon one of the arrows dropped by Apollo in the hurry of his
pursuit; in consequence of which the king dedicated the place to
the god. A temple was erected in his honour, ample in its
proportions, sumptuous in its adornments; the internal walls were
resplendent with polished marbles, the 
<pb n="132" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_132.html" id="vii.ii-Page_132" />lofty ceiling was of cypress wood. The
colossal image of the god, enriched with gold and gems, nearly
reached the top of the roof. * * * With one hand the deity lightly
touched the lyre which hung from his shoulders and in the other he
held a golden dish, as if about to pour a libation on the earth
“and supplicate the venerable mother to give to his arms the cold
and beauteous Daphne.”<note place="end" n="364" id="vii.ii-p4.1"><p class="endnote" id="vii.ii-p5"> Gibbon, vol. iv. p. 111. Milman’s ed.</p></note> The whole grove became consecrated
to pleasure under the guise of festivity in honor of the god. * * *
It contained everything which could gratify and charm the senses;
the deep impenetrable shade of cypress trees, the delicious noise
and coolness of falling waters, the fragrance of aromatic shrubs;
there were also baths, and grottos, porticoes, and colonnades. Such
materials for voluptuous enjoyment told with fatal effect upon the
morals of a people addicted at all times to an immoderate
indulgence in luxurious pleasure.<note place="end" n="365" id="vii.ii-p5.1"><p class="endnote" id="vii.ii-p6"> Life of St. John Chrysostom, by W. R. W. Stephens,
pp. 101–3, 3d ed.</p></note> Daphne became one of those places
where gross and shameless vice was practised under the sanction of
religion. The intention of Cæsar Gallus in translating the
reliques of Babylas to Daphne was as Chrysostom expresses it to
“bring a physician to the sick;” to introduce a pure and
Christian association into a spot hitherto consecrated to Pagan and
licentious rites. The bones of the saint were laid near the shrine
of Apollo, and the Christian church standing hard by the heathen
temple was a visible warning to any Christian who might visit the
place to abstain from deeds abhorrent to the faith for which the
bishop had died. But the remains of the martyr were not permitted
to rest in peace. When the Emperor Julian visited Antioch 362, he
consulted the oracle of Apollo at Daphne respecting the issue of
the expedition which he was about to make into Persia. But the
oracle was dumb. At length the god yielded to the importunity of
prayers and sacrifices so far as to explain the cause of his
silence. He was offended by the proximity of dead men. “Break
open the sepulchres, take up the bones, and carry them hence.” No
name was mentioned, but the demand was interpreted as referring to
the remains of Babylas, and the wishes of the affronted deity were
complied with. The Christians were commanded by Julian to remove
the bones of their saint from the neighbourhood of Apollo’s
sanctuary. They obeyed, but what was intended to be a humiliation
was converted into a triumph. The reliques were conveyed to their
resting place within the city as in a kind of festive procession,
accompanied by crowds along the whole way, four or five miles,
chanting the words of the Psalm, “Confounded be all they that
worship carved images and delight in vain gods.” In vain were
some of the Christians seized and tortured. The popularity of the
saint grew in proportion as Julian tried to put it down; and the
insults done to him were speedily avenged. A fire, mysterious in
its origin, broke out soon after the removal of the martyr’s
reliques in the shrine of Apollo, consuming the roof of the
building, and the statue of the god. At the time when Chrysostom
preached, about twenty years later, the columns and walls were
still standing, the melancholy wreck serving as a memorial and
witness of the judgment which had fallen upon the place.</p>

<p class="c10" id="vii.ii-p7">The remains of Babylas were not brought back to
Daphne, but removed from the city to a magnificent church built to
receive them on the other side of Orontes. Near the close of his
discourse Chrysostom refers to the erection of this church and to
the zeal of the Bishop Meletius in promoting it, who actually took
part in the work with his own hands, as we are told that Hugh did
in the building of the Minster at Lincoln. But although the body of
the martyr rested elsewhere, his spirit and influence were supposed
to inhabit in a special manner the spot where he had put the
heathen deity to silence and shame, and to confer blessings on the
pilgrims who resorted in crowds to his martyr in Daphne. The ruined
and deserted temple indeed, and the well preserved Christian church
thronged with worshippers, standing as they did side by side,
formed a striking emblem of the two religions to which they were
devoted—the one destined to crumble and vanish away, the other to
endure and conquer.</p>

<p class="c9" id="vii.iii-p6">1. <span class="c12" id="vii.iii-p6.1">Sumptuous</span> and
splendid entertainers give frequent and constant entertainments,
alike to display their own wealth, and to show good-will to their
acquaintance. So also the grace of the Spirit, affording us a proof
of his own power, and displaying much good-will towards the friends
of God, sets before us successively and constantly the tables of
the martyrs. Lately, for instance, a maiden quite young, and
unmarried, the blessed martyr Pelagia, entertained us, with much
joy. To-day again, this blessed and noble martyr Ignatius has
succeeded to her feast. The persons are different: The table is
one. The wrestlings are varied: The crown is one. The contests are
manifold: The prize is the same. For in the case of the heathen
contests, since the tasks are bodily, men alone are, with reason,
admitted. But here, since the contest is wholly concerning the
soul, the lists are open to each sex, for each kind the theatre is
arranged. Neither do men alone disrobe, in order that the women may
not take refuge in the weakness of their nature, and seem to have a
plausible excuse, nor have women only quitted themselves like men,

nor age, nor any such thing could be a hindrance to those who run
in the course of religion; if there be a noble readiness, and an
eager mind, and a fear of God, fervent and kindling, be established
in our souls. On this account both maidens and women, and men, both
young and old, and slaves, and freemen, and every rank, and every
age, and each sex, disrobe for those contests, and in no respect
suffer harm, since they have brought a noble purpose to these
wrestlings. The season then already calls us to discourse of the
mighty works of this saint. But our reckoning is disturbed and
confused, not knowing what to say first, what second, what third,
so great a multitude of things calling for eulogy surrounds us, on
every side; and we experience the same thing as if any one went
into a meadow, and seeing many a rosebush and many a violet, and an
abundance of lilies, and other spring flowers manifold and varied,
should be in doubt what he should look at first, what second, since
each of those he saw invites him to bestow his glances on itself.
For we too, coming to this spiritual meadow of the mighty works of
Ignatius, and beholding not the flowers of spring, but the manifold
and varied fruit of the spirit in the soul of this man, are
confused and in perplexity, not knowing to which we are first to
give our consideration, as each of the things we see draws us away
from its neighbours, and entices the eye of the soul to the sight
of its own beauty. For see, he presided over the Church among us
nobly, and with such carefulness as Christ desires. For that which
Christ declared <pb n="136" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_136.html" id="vii.iii-Page_136" />to
be the highest standard and rule of the Episcopal office, did this
man display by his deeds. For having heard Christ saying, the good
shepherd layeth down his life for the sheep,<note place="end" n="368" id="vii.iii-p7.2"><p class="endnote" id="vii.iii-p8"> <scripRef passage="John x. 11" id="vii.iii-p8.1" parsed="|John|10|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.10.11">John x.
11</scripRef>.</p></note> with all courage he did lay it down
for the sheep.</p>

<p class="c10" id="vii.iii-p9">He held true converse with the apostles and drank of
spiritual fountains. What kind of person then is it likely that he
was who had been reared, and who had everywhere held converse with
them, and had shared with them truths both lawful and unlawful to
utter, and who seemed to them worthy of so great a dignity? The
time again came on, which demanded courage; and a soul which
despised all things present, glowed with Divine love, and valued
things unseen before the things which are seen; and he lay aside
the flesh with as much ease as one would put off a garment. What
then shall we speak of first? The teaching of the apostles which he
gave proof of throughout, or his indifference to this present life,
or the strictness of his virtue, with which he administered his
rule over the Church; which shall we first call to mind? The martyr
or the bishop or the apostle. For the grace of the spirit having
woven a threefold crown, thus bound it on his holy head, yea rather
a manifold crown. For if any one will consider them carefully, he
will find each of the crowns, blossoming with other crowns for
us.</p>

<p class="c10" id="vii.iii-p10">2. And if you will, let us come first to the
praise of his episcopate. Does this seem to be one crown alone?
come, then, let us unfold it in speech, and you will see both two,
and three, and more produced from it. For I do not wonder at the
man alone that he seemed to be worthy of so great an office, but
that he obtained this office from those saints, and that the hands
of the blessed apostles touched his sacred head. For not even is
this a slight thing to be said in his praise, nor because he won
greater grace from above, nor only because they caused more
abundant energy of the Spirit to come upon him, but because they
bore witness that every virtue possessed by man was in him. Now how
this is, I tell you. Paul writing to Titus once on a time—and
when I say Paul, I do not speak of him alone, but also of Peter and
James and John, and the whole band of them; for as in one lyre, the
strings are different strings, but the harmony is one, so also in
the band of the apostles the persons are different, but the
teaching is one, since the artificer is one, I mean the Holy
Spirit, who moves their souls, and Paul showing this said,
“Whether therefore they, or I, so we preach.”<note place="end" n="369" id="vii.iii-p10.1"><p class="endnote" id="vii.iii-p11"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. xv. 11" id="vii.iii-p11.1" parsed="|1Cor|15|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.15.11">1 Cor. xv.
11</scripRef>.</p></note> This man, then, writing to Titus,
and showing what kind of man the bishop ought to be, says, “For
the bishop must be blameless as God’s steward; not self-willed,
not soon angry, no brawler, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre;
but given to hospitality, a lover of good, sober-minded, just,
holy, temperate, holding to the faithful word, which is according
to the teaching, that he may be able both to exhort in the sound
doctrine, and to convict the gainsayers;”<note place="end" n="370" id="vii.iii-p11.2"><p class="endnote" id="vii.iii-p12"> <scripRef passage="Titus i. 7-9" id="vii.iii-p12.1" parsed="|Titus|1|7|1|9" osisRef="Bible:Titus.1.7-Titus.1.9">Titus i.
7–9</scripRef>.</p></note> and to Timothy again, when writing
upon this subject, he says somewhat like this: “If a man seeketh
the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work. The bishop,
therefore, must be without reproach, the husband of one wife,
temperate, sober-minded, orderly, given to hospitality, apt to
teach, no brawler, no striker, but gentle, not contentious, no
lover of money. Dost thou see what strictness of virtue he demands
from the bishop? For as some most excellent painter from life,
having mixed many colors, if he be about to furnish an original
likeness of the royal form, works with all accuracy, so that all
who are copying it, and painting from it, may have a likeness
accurately drawn, so accordingly the blessed Paul, as though
painting some royal likeness, and furnishing an original sketch of
it, having mixed the different colors of virtue, has painted in the
features of the office of bishop complete, in order that each of
those who mount to that dignity, looking thereupon, may administer
their own affairs with just such strictness.</p>

<p class="c10" id="vii.iii-p13">Boldly, therefore, would I say that Ignatius
took an accurate impression of the whole of this, in his own soul;
and was blameless and without reproach, and neither self-willed,
nor soon angry, nor given to wine, nor a striker, but gentle, not
contentious, no lover of money, just, holy, temperate, holding to
the faithful word which is according to the teaching, sober,
sober-minded, orderly, and all the rest which Paul demanded. “And
what is the proof of this?” says one. They who said these things
ordained him, and they who suggest to others with so great
strictness to make proof of those who are about to mount to the
throne of this office, would not themselves have done this
negligently. But had they not seen all this virtue planted in the
soul of this martyr would not have entrusted him with this office.
For they knew accurately how great danger besets those who bring
about such ordinations, carelessly and hap-hazard. And Paul again,
when showing this very thing to the same Timothy wrote and says,
“Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other
men’s sins.”<note place="end" n="371" id="vii.iii-p13.1"><p class="endnote" id="vii.iii-p14"> <scripRef passage="1 Tim. v. 22" id="vii.iii-p14.1" parsed="|1Tim|5|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.5.22">1 Tim. v.

thou say? Has an<pb n="137" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_137.html" id="vii.iii-Page_137" />other
sinned, and do I share his blame and his punishment? Yes, says he,
the man who authorizes evil; and just as in the case of any one
entrusting into the hands of a raging and insane person a sharply
pointed sword, with which the madman commits murder, that man who
gave the sword incurs the blame; so any one who gives the authority
which arises from this office to a man living in evil, draws down
on his own head all the fire of that man’s sins and audacity. For
he who provides the root, this man is the cause of all that springs
from it on every side. Dost thou see how in the meanwhile a double
crown of the episcopate has appeared, and how the dignity of those
who ordained him has made the office more illustrious, bearing
witness to every exhibition of virtue in him?</p>

<p class="c10" id="vii.iii-p15">3. Do you wish that I should also reveal to
you another crown springing from this very matter? Let us consider
the time at which he obtained this dignity. For it is not the same
thing to administer the Church now as then, just as it is not the
same thing to travel along a road well trodden, and prepared, after
many wayfarers; and along one about to be cut for the first time,
and containing ruts, and stones, and full of wild beasts, and which
has never yet, received any traveller. For now, by the grace of
God, there is no danger for bishops, but deep peace on all sides,
and we all enjoy a calm, since the Word of piety has been extended
to the ends of the world, and our rulers keep the faith with
strictness. But then there was nothing of this, but wherever any
one might look, precipices and pitfalls, and wars, and fightings,
and dangers; both rulers, and kings, and people and cities and
nations, and men at home and abroad, laid snares for the faithful.
And this was not the only serious thing, but also the fact that
many of the believers themselves, inasmuch as they tasted for the
first time strange doctrines, stood in need of great indulgence,
and were still in a somewhat feeble condition and were often upset.
And this was a thing which used to grieve the teachers, no less
than the fightings without, nay rather much more. For the fightings
without, and the plottings, afforded much pleasure to them on
account of the hope of the rewards awaiting them. On this account
the apostles returned from the presence of the Sanhedrin rejoicing
because they had been beaten;<note place="end" n="372" id="vii.iii-p15.1"><p class="endnote" id="vii.iii-p16"> <scripRef passage="Acts v. 41" id="vii.iii-p16.1" parsed="|Acts|5|41|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.5.41">Acts v.

rejoice in my sufferings,”<note place="end" n="373" id="vii.iii-p16.2"><p class="endnote" id="vii.iii-p17"> <scripRef passage="Col. i. 24" id="vii.iii-p17.1" parsed="|Col|1|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Col.1.24">Col. i.

everywhere. But the wounds of those at home, and the falls of the
brethren, do not suffer them to breathe again, but always, like
some most heavy yoke, continually oppress and afflict the neck of
their soul. Hear at least how Paul, thus rejoicing in sufferings,
is bitterly pained about these. “For who, saith he, is weak, and
I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?”<note place="end" n="374" id="vii.iii-p17.2"><p class="endnote" id="vii.iii-p18"> <scripRef passage="2 Cor. xi. 29" id="vii.iii-p18.1" parsed="|2Cor|11|29|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.11.29">2 Cor. xi.

“I fear lest when I come I shall find you not such as I would,

when I come again to you, God humble me, and I shall mourn many of
those who have sinned before, and have not repented of their
uncleanness, and wantonness, and fornication which they have
committed.”<note place="end" n="376" id="vii.iii-p19.2"><p class="endnote" id="vii.iii-p20"> <scripRef passage="2 Cor. xii. 21" id="vii.iii-p20.1" parsed="|2Cor|12|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.12.21">2 Cor.

throughout thou seest that he is in tears and lamentations on
account of members of the household, and evermore fearing and
trembling for the believers. Just as then we admire the pilot, not
when he is able to bring those who are on board safe to shore when
the sea is calm, and the ship is borne along by favourable winds,
but when the deep is raging and the waves contending, and the
passengers themselves within in revolt, and a great storm within
and without besets those who are on board, and he is able to steer
the ship with all security; so we ought to wonder at, and admire
those who then had the Church committed to their hands, much more
than those who now have the management of it; when there was a
great war without and within, when the plant of the faith was more
tender, and needed much care, when, as a newly-born babe, the
multitude in the church required much forethought, and the greatest
wisdom in any soul destined to nurse it; and in order that ye may
more clearly learn, how great crowns they were worthy of, who then
had the Church entrusted to them, and how great work and danger
there was in undertaking the matter on the threshold and at the
beginning, and in being the first to enter upon it, I bring forward
for you the testimony of Christ, who pronounces a verdict on these
things, and confirms the opinion which has been expressed by me.
For when he saw many coming to him, and was wishing to show the
apostles that the prophets toiled more than they, he says:
“Others have laboured, and ye have entered into their
labour.”<note place="end" n="377" id="vii.iii-p20.2"><p class="endnote" id="vii.iii-p21"> <scripRef passage="John iv. 38" id="vii.iii-p21.1" parsed="|John|4|38|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.4.38">John iv.
38</scripRef>.</p></note> And yet the
apostles toiled much more than the prophets. But since they first
sowed the word of piety, and won over the untaught souls of men to
the truth, the greater part of the work is credited to them. For it
is by no means the same thing for one to come and teach after many
teachers, and himself to be the first to sow seeds. For that which
has been already practised, and has become customary with many,
would be easily 
<pb n="138" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_138.html" id="vii.iii-Page_138" />accepted; but that which is now for the
first time heard, agitates the mind of the hearers, and gives the
teacher a great deal to do. This at least it was which disturbed
the audience at Athens, and on this account they turned away from
Paul, reproaching him with, “Thou bringest certain strange things
to our ears.”<note place="end" n="378" id="vii.iii-p21.2"><p class="endnote" id="vii.iii-p22"> <scripRef passage="Acts xvii. 20" id="vii.iii-p22.1" parsed="|Acts|17|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.17.20">Acts xvii.
20</scripRef>.</p></note> For if the
oversight of the Church now furnishes much weariness and work to
those who govern it, consider how double and treble and manifold
was the work then, when there were dangers and fighting and snares,
and fear continually. It is not possible to set forth in words the
difficulty which those saints then encountered, but he alone will
know it who comes to it by experience.</p>

<p class="c10" id="vii.iii-p23">4. And I will speak of a fourth crown, arising for
us out of this episcopate. What then is this? The fact that he was
entrusted with our own native city. For it is a laborious thing
indeed to have the oversight of a hundred men, and of fifty alone.
But to have on one’s hands so great a city, and a population
extending to two hundred thousand, of how great virtue and wisdom
dost thou think there is a proof? For as in the care of armies, the
wiser of the generals have on their hands the more leading and more
numerous regiments, so, accordingly, in the care of cities. The
more able of the rulers are entrusted with the larger and more
populous. And at any rate this city was of much account to God, as
indeed He manifested by the very deeds which He did. At all events
the master of the whole world, Peter, to whose hands He committed
the keys of heaven, whom He commanded to do and to bear all, He
bade tarry here for a long period. Thus in His sight our city was
equivalent to the whole world. But since I have mentioned Peter, I
have perceived a fifth crown woven from him, and this is that this
man succeeded to the office after him. For just as any one taking a
great stone from a foundation hastens by all means to introduce an
equivalent to it, lest he should shake the whole building, and make
it more unsound, so, accordingly, when Peter was about to depart
from here, the grace of the Spirit introduced another teacher
equivalent to Peter, so that the building already completed should
not be made more unsound by the insignificance of the successor. We
have reckoned up then five crowns, from the importance of the
office, from the dignity of those who ordained to it, from the
difficulty of the time, from the size of the city, from the virtue
of him who transmitted the episcopate to him. Having woven all
these, it was lawful to speak of a sixth, and seventh, and more
than these; but in order that we may not, by spending the whole
time on the consideration of the episcopate, miss the details about
the martyr, come from this point, let us pass to that conflict. At
one time a grievous warfare was rekindled against the Church, and
as though a most grievous tyranny overspread the earth, all were
carried off from the midst of the market-place. Not indeed charged
with anything monstrous, but because being freed from error, they
hastened to piety; because they abstained from the service of
demons, because they recognized the true God, and worshipped his
only begotten Son, and for things for which they ought to have been
crowned, and admired and honoured, for these they were punished and
encountered countless tortures, all who embraced the faith, and
much more they who had the oversight of the churches. For the
devil, being crafty, and apt to contrive plots of this kind,
expected that if he took away the shepherds, he would easily be
able to scatter the flocks. But He who takes the wise in their
craftiness, wishing to show him that men do not govern His church,
but that it is He himself who everywhere tends those who believe on
Him, agreed that this should be, that he might see, when they were
taken away, that the cause of piety was not defeated, nor the word
of preaching quenched, but rather increased; that by these very
works he might learn both himself, and all those who minister to
him, that our affairs are not of men, but that the subject of our
teaching has its root on high, from the heavens; and that it is God
who everywhere leads the Church, and that it is not possible for
him who fights against God, ever to win the day. But the Devil did
not only work this evil, but another also not less than this. For
not only in the cities over which they presided, did he suffer the
Bishops to be slaughtered; but he took them into foreign territory
and slew them; and he did this, in anxiety at once to take them
when destitute of friends, and hoping to render them weaker with
the toil of their journey, which accordingly he did with this
saint. For he called him away from our city to Rome, making the
course twice as long, expecting to depress his mind both by the
length of the way and the number of the days, and not knowing that
having Jesus with him, as a fellow traveller, and fellow exile on
so long a journey, he rather became the stronger, and afforded more
proof of the power that was with him, and to a greater degree knit
the Churches together. For the cities which were on the road
running together from all sides, encouraged the athlete, and sped
him on his way with many supplies, sharing in his conflict <pb n="139" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_139.html" id="vii.iii-Page_139" />by their prayers, and
intercessions. And they derived no little comfort when they saw the
martyr hastening to death with so much readiness, as is consistent
in one called to the realms which are in the heaven, and by means
of the works themselves, by the readiness and by the joyousness of
that noble man, that it was not death to which he was hastening,
but a kind of long journey and migration from this world, and
ascension to heaven; and he departed teaching these things in every
city, both by his words, and by his deeds, and as happened in the
case of the Jews, when they bound Paul, and sent him to Rome, and
thought that they were sending him to death, they were sending a
teacher to the Jews who dwelt there. This indeed accordingly
happened in the case of Ignatius in larger measure. For not to
those alone who dwell in Rome, but to all the cities lying in the
intervening space, he went forth as a wonderful teacher, persuading
them to despise the present life, and to think naught of the things
which are seen, and to love those which are to come, to look
towards heaven, and to pay no regard to any of the terrors of this
present life. For on this and on more than this, by means of his
works, he went on his way instructing them, as a sun rising from
the east, and hastening to the west. But rather more brilliant than
this, for this is wont to run on high, bringing material light, but
Ignatius shone below, imparting to men’s souls the intellectual
light of doctrine. And that light on departing into the regions of
the west, is hidden and straightway causes the night to come on.
But this on departing to the regions of the west, shone there more
brilliantly, conferring the greatest benefits to all along the
road. And when he arrived at the city, even <i>that</i> he
instructed in Christian wisdom. For on this account God permitted
him there to end his life, so that this man’s death might be
instructive to all who dwell in Rome. For <i>we</i> by the grace of
God need henceforward no evidence, being rooted in the faith. But
they who dwelt in Rome, inasmuch as there was great impiety there,
required more help. On this account both Peter and Paul, and this
man after them, were all slain there, partly, indeed, in order that
they might purify with their own blood, the city which had been
defiled with blood of idols, and partly in order that they might by
their works afford a proof of the resurrection of the crucified
Christ, persuading those who dwell in Rome, that they would not
with so much pleasure disdain this present life, did they not
firmly persuade themselves that they were about to ascend to the
crucified Jesus, and to see him in the heavens. For in reality it
is the greatest proof of the resurrection that the slain Christ
should show forth so great power after death, as to persuade living
men to despise both country and home and friends, and acquaintance
and life itself, for the sake of confessing him, and to choose in
place of present pleasures, both stripes and dangers and death. For
these are not the achievements of any dead man, nor of one
remaining in the tomb but of one risen and living. Since how
couldest thou account, when he was alive, for all the Apostles who
companied with him becoming weaker through fear to betray their
teachers and to flee and depart; but when he died, for not only
Peter and Paul, but even Ignatius, who had not even seen him, nor
enjoyed his companionship, showing such earnestness as to lay down
life itself for his sake?</p>

<p class="c10" id="vii.iii-p24">5. In order then that all who dwell in Rome
might learn that these things are a reality, God allowed that there
the saint should be perfected,<note place="end" n="379" id="vii.iii-p24.1"><p class="endnote" id="vii.iii-p25"> Sc., suffer a martyr’s death.</p></note> and that this was the reason I will
guarantee from the very manner of his death. For not outside the
walls, in a dungeon, nor even in a court of justice, nor in some
corner, did he receive the sentence which condemned him, but in the
midst of the theatre, while the whole city was seated above him, he
underwent this form of martyrdom, wild beasts being let loose upon
him, in order that he might plant his trophy against the Devil,
beneath the eyes of all, and make all spectators emulous of his own
conflicts. Not dying thus nobly only, but dying even with pleasure.
For not as though about to be severed from life, but as called to a
better and more spiritual life, so he beheld the wild beasts
gladly. Whence is this manifest? From the words which he uttered
when about to die, for when he heard that this manner of punishment
awaited him, “may I have joy,” said he, “of these wild
beasts.”<note place="end" n="380" id="vii.iii-p25.1"><p class="endnote" id="vii.iii-p26"> Quoted from Epistle of Ignatius to the Romans, c.
v.</p></note> For such are
the loving. For they receive with pleasure whatever they may suffer
for the sake of those who are beloved, and they seem to have their
desire satisfied when what happens to them is more than usually
grievous. Which happened, therefore, in this man’s case. For not
by his death alone, but also by his readiness he studied to emulate
the apostles, and hearing that they, after they had been scourged
retired with joy, himself too wished to imitate his teachers, not
only by his death, but by his joy. On this account he said, “may
I have joy of thy wild beasts,” and much milder than the tongue
of the tyrant did he consider the mouths of these; and very
reasonably. For while that invited 
<pb n="140" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_140.html" id="vii.iii-Page_140" />him to Gehenna, their mouths escorted him to a
kingdom. When, therefore, he made an end of life there, yea rather,
when he ascended to heaven, he departed henceforward crowned. For
this also happened through the dispensation of God, that he
restored him again to us, and distributed the martyr to the cities.
For that city received his blood as it dropped, but ye were
honoured with his remains, ye enjoyed his episcopate, they enjoyed
his martyrdom. They saw him in conflict, and victorious, and
crowned, but ye have him continually. For a little time God removed
him from you, and with greater glory granted him again to you. And
as those who borrow money, return with interest what they receive,
so also God, using this valued treasure of yours, for a little
while, and having shown it to that city, with greater brilliancy
gave it back to you. Ye sent forth a Bishop, and received a martyr;
ye sent him forth with prayers, and ye received him with crowns;
and not only ye, but all the cities which intervene. For how do ye
think that they behaved when they saw his remains being brought
back? What pleasure was produced! how they rejoiced! with what
applause on all sides they beset the crowned one! For as with a
noble athlete, who has wrestled down all his antagonists, and who
comes forth with radiant glory from the arena, the spectators
receive him, and do not suffer him to tread the earth, bringing him
home on their shoulders, and besetting him with countless praises:
so also the cities in order receiving this saint then from Rome,
and bearing him upon their shoulders as far as this city, escorted
the crowned one with praises, celebrating the champion, in song;
laughing the Devil to scorn, because his artifice was turned
against him, and what he thought to do against the martyr, this
turned out for his behoof. Then, indeed, he profited, and
encouraged all the cities; and from that time to this day he
enriches this city, and as some perpetual treasure, drawn upon
every day, yet not failing, makes all who partake of it more
prosperous, so also this blessed Ignatius filleth those who come to
him with blessings, with boldness, nobleness of spirit, and much
courage, and so sendeth them home.</p>

<p class="c10" id="vii.iii-p27">Not only to-day, therefore, but every day let
us go forth to him, plucking spiritual fruits from him. For it is,
it is possible for him who comes hither with faith to gather the
fruit of many good things. For not the bodies only, but the very
sepulchres of the saints have been filled with spiritual grace. For

now, when grace is more abundant, when the energy of the spirit is
greater, is it possible that one touching a sepulchre, with faith,
should win great power; thence on this account God allowed us the
remains of the saints, wishing to lead by them us to the same
emulation, and to afford us a kind of haven, and a secure
consolation for the evils which are ever overtaking us. Wherefore I
beseech you all, if any is in despondency, if in disease, if under
insult, if in any other circumstance of this life, if in the depth
of sins, let him come hither with faith, and he will lay aside all
those things, and will return with much joy, having procured a
lighter conscience from the sight alone. But more, it is not only
necessary that those who are in affliction should come hither, but
if any one be in cheerfulness, in glory, in power, in much
assurance towards God, let not this man despise the benefit. For
coming hither and beholding this saint, he will keep these noble
possessions unmoved, persuading his own soul to be moderate by the
recollection of this man’s mighty deeds, and not suffering his
conscience by the mighty deeds to be lifted up to any self conceit.
And it is no slight thing for those in prosperity not to be puffed
up at their good fortune, but to know how to bear their prosperity
with moderation, so that the treasure is serviceable to all, the
resting place is suitable, for the fallen, in order that they may
escape from their temptations, for the fortunate, that their
success may remain secure, for those in weakness indeed, that they
may return to health, and for the healthy, that they may not fall
into weakness. Considering all which things, let us prefer this way
of spending our time, to all delight, all pleasure, in order that
rejoicing at once, and profiting, we may be able to become
partakers with these saints, both of their dwelling and of their
home, through the prayers of the saints themselves, through the
grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, with whom be
glory to the Father with the Holy Spirit, now and always forever
and ever amen.</p>

<p class="c9" id="vii.iv-p2">1. <span class="c12" id="vii.iv-p2.1">I was</span> anxious
to-day to pay the debt which I promised you when I was lately here.
But what am I to do? In the meanwhile, the blessed Babylas has
appeared, and has called me to himself, uttering no voice, but
attracting our attention by the brightness of his countenance. Be
ye not, therefore, displeased at the delay in my payment; at all
events, the longer the time is, the more the interest will
increase. For we will deposit this money with interest.<note place="end" n="382" id="vii.iv-p2.2"><p class="endnote" id="vii.iv-p3"> <scripRef passage="Luke xix. 23" id="vii.iv-p3.1" parsed="|Luke|19|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.19.23">Luke xix.
23</scripRef>.</p></note> Since thus
did the master command who entrusted it to us. Being confident,
therefore, about what is lent, that both the principal and the
profit await you, let us not pass by the gain which falls in our
way to-day, but revel in the noble actions of the blessed
Babylas.</p>

<p class="c10" id="vii.iv-p4">How, indeed, he presided over the Church which is
among us, and saved that sacred ship, in storm, and in wave, and
billow; and what a bold front he showed to the emperor, and how he
lay down his life for the sheep and underwent that blessed
slaughter; these things and such as these, we will leave to the
elder among our teachers, and to our common father, to speak of.
For the more remote matters, the aged can relate to you but as many
things as happened lately, and within our lifetime, these, I a
young man will relate to you, I mean those after death, those after
the burial of the martyr, those which happened while he remained in
the suburbs of the city. And I know indeed that the Greeks will
laugh at my promise, if I promise to speak of the noble deeds after
death and burial of one who was buried, and had crumbled to dust.
We shall not assuredly on this account keep silence, but on this
very account shall especially speak, in order that by showing this
marvel truly, we may turn their laughter upon their own head. For
of an ordinary man there would be no noble deeds after death. But
of a martyr, many and great deeds, not in order that he might
become more illustrious (for he has no need of glory from the
multitude), but that thou, the unbeliever mayest learn that the
death of the martyrs is not death, but the beginning of a better
life, and the prelude of a more spiritual conversation, and a
change from the worse to the better. Do not then look at the fact,
that the mere body of the martyr lies destitute of energy of soul;
but observe this, that a greater power takes its place by the side
of it, different from the soul itself—I mean the grace of the
Holy Spirit, which pleads to all on behalf of the resurrection, by
means of the wonders which it works. For if God has granted greater
power to bodies dead and crumbled to dust, than to all living, much
more will he grant to them a better life than the former, and a
longer, at the time of the bestowal of his crowns; what then are
this saint’s noble deeds? But be not disturbed, if we take our
discourse a little further back. For they who wish to display their
portraits to advantage, do not uncover them until they have placed
the spectators a little way off from the picture, making the view
clearer by the distance. Do you then also have patience with me
while I direct my discourse into the past.</p>

<p class="c10" id="vii.iv-p5">For when Julian who surpassed all in impiety,
ascended the imperial throne, and grasped the despotic sceptre,
straightway he lifted up his hands against the God who created him,
and ignored his benefactor, and looking from the earth beneath to
the heavens, howled after the manner of mad dogs, who alike bay at
those who do not feed them and those who do feed them. But he
rather was mad with a more savage madness than theirs. For they
indeed turn from, and hate their friends and strangers alike. But
this man used to fawn upon demons, strangers to his salvation, and
used to worship them with every mode of worship. But his
benefactor, and Saviour, and him who spared not the only Begotten,
for his sake, he turned from and used to hate, and made havoc of
the cross, the very thing which uplifted the whole world when it
was lying prostrate, and drave away the darkness on all sides, and
brought in light more brilliant than the sunbeams; nor yet even
then did he desist from his frenzy, but promised that he would tear
the nation of the Galilæans, out of the midst of the world; for
thus he was wont to call us; and yet if he thought the names of the
Christians an abomination, and Christianity itself to be full of
much shame, for what reason did he not desire to put us to shame by
that means, but with a strange name? Yea because he knew clearly,
that to be called by what belongs to Christ, is a great ornament
not only to men, but to angels, and to the powers above. On this
account he set everything in motion, so as to strip us of this
ornament, and put a stop to the preaching of it. But this was
impossible, O wretched and miserable man! as it was impossible to
destroy the heaven and to quench the sun, and to shake and cast
down the foundations of the earth, and those things <pb n="142" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_142.html" id="vii.iv-Page_142" />Christ foretold, thus saying:
“Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass
away.”<note place="end" n="383" id="vii.iv-p5.1"><p class="endnote" id="vii.iv-p6"> <scripRef passage="Matt. xxiv. 35" id="vii.iv-p6.1" parsed="|Matt|24|35|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.24.35">Matt.
xxiv. 35</scripRef>.</p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="vii.iv-p7">Well, thou dost not submit to Christ’s words;
accept therefore the utterance which thus his deeds give. For I
indeed having been privileged to know what the declaration of God
is, how strong, how invincible a thing, have believed that is more
trustworthy than the order of nature, and than experience in all
matters. But do thou still creeping on the ground, and agitated
with the investigations of human reasoning, receive the witness of
the deeds. I gainsay nothing. I strive not.</p>

<p class="c10" id="vii.iv-p8">2. What then do the deeds say? Christ said
that it was easier for heaven and earth to be destroyed, than for
any of his words to fail.<note place="end" n="384" id="vii.iv-p8.1"><p class="endnote" id="vii.iv-p9"> <scripRef passage="Luke xvi. 17" id="vii.iv-p9.1" parsed="|Luke|16|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.16.17">Luke xvi.
17</scripRef>.</p></note> The emperor contradicted these
words, and threatened to destroy his decrees. Where then is the
emperor who threatened these things? He is perished and is
corrupted, and is now in Hades, awaiting the inevitable punishment.
But where is Christ who uttered these decrees? In Heaven, on the
right hand of the Father, occupying the highest throne of glory;
where are the blasphemous words of the Emperor, and his unchastened
tongue? They are become ashes, and dust and the food of worms.
Where is the sentence of Christ? It shines forth by the very truth
of the deed, receiving its lustre from the issue of the events, as
from a golden column. And yet the emperor left nothing undone, when
about to raise war against us, but used to call prophets together,
and summon sorcerers, and everything was full of demons and evil
spirits.</p>

<p class="c10" id="vii.iv-p10">What then was the return for this worship? The
overturning of cities, the bitterest famine of all famines. For ye
know doubtless, and remember, how empty indeed the market place was
of wares, and the workshops full of confusion, when everyone strove
to snatch up what came first and to depart. And why do I speak of
famine, when the very fountains of waters were failing, fountains
which by the abundance of their stream, used to eclipse the rivers.
But since I have mentioned the fountains, come, forthwith, let us
go up to Daphne, and conduct our discourse to the noble deeds of
the martyr. Although you desire me still to parade the indecencies
of the Greeks, although I too desire this, let us abstain; for
wherever the commemoration of a martyr is, there certainly also is
the shame of the Greeks. This emperor then, going up to Daphne used
to weary Apollo, praying, supplicating, entreating, so that the
events of the future might be foretold to him. What then did the
prophet, the great God of the Greeks? “The dead prevent me from
uttering,” saith he, “but break open the graves, dig up the
bones, move the dead.” What could be more impious than these
commands? The Demon of grave-robbing, introduces strange laws and
devises new methods of expelling strangers. Who ever heard of the
dead being driven forth? who ever saw lifeless bodies ordered to be
moved as he commanded, overturning from their foundations the
common laws of nature. For the laws of nature are common to all
men, that he who departs this life should be hidden in the earth,
and delivered over for burial, and be covered up in the bosom of
the earth the mother of all; and these laws, neither Greek,
barbarian, Scythian, nor if there be any more savage than they,
ever changed, but all reverence them, and keep them, and thus they
are sacred and venerated by all. But the Demon raises his mask, and
with bare head, resists the common laws of nature. For the dead, he
says, are a pollution. The dead are not a pollution, a most wicked
demon, but a wicked intention is an abomination. But if one must
say something startling, the bodies of the living full of evil, are
more polluting than those of the dead. For the one minister to the
behests of the mind, but the other lie unmoved. Now that which is
unmoved, and destitute of all perception would be free from all
accusation. Not that I even would say that the bodies of the living
are by nature polluting; but that everywhere a wicked and perverted
intention is open to accusations from all.</p>

<p class="c10" id="vii.iv-p11">The dead body then is not a pollution O
Apollo, but to persecute a maiden who wishes to be modest, and to
outrage the dignity of a virgin, and to lament at the failure of
the shameless deed, this is worthy of accusation, and punishment.
There were at all events, many wonderful and great prophets among
ourselves, who spake also many things concerning the future, and
they in no case used to bid those who asked them to dig up the
bones of the departed. Yea Ezekiel standing near the bones
themselves was not only not hindered by them, but added flesh, and
nerves and skin to them, and brought them back to life again.<note place="end" n="385" id="vii.iv-p11.1"><p class="endnote" id="vii.iv-p12"> <scripRef passage="Ez. xxxvii" id="vii.iv-p12.1" parsed="|Ezek|37|0|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ezek.37">Ez.
xxxvii</scripRef>.</p></note> But the
great Moses did not stand near the bones of the dead, but bearing
off the whole dead body of Joseph, thus foretold things to come.<note place="end" n="386" id="vii.iv-p12.2"><p class="endnote" id="vii.iv-p13"> <scripRef passage="Ex. xiii. 19" id="vii.iv-p13.1" parsed="|Exod|13|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Exod.13.19">Ex. xiii.
19</scripRef>.</p></note> And very
reasonably, for their words were the grace of the Holy Spirit. But
the words of these, a deceit, and a lie which is no wise able to be
concealed. For that these things were an excuse, and pretence and
that he feared the blessed Babylas, is manifest from what the
emperor did. For leaving all the other dead, he only moved that
martyr. And <pb n="143" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_143.html" id="vii.iv-Page_143" />yet if he
did these things, in disgust at him, and not in fear, it were
necessary that he should order the coffin to be broken, thrown into
the sea, carried to the desert, be made to disappear by some other
method of destruction; for this is the part of one who is
disgusted. Thus God did when he spake to the Hebrews about the
abominations of the Gentiles. He bade their statues to be broken,
not to bring their abominations from the suburbs to the city.</p>

<p class="c10" id="vii.iv-p14">3. The martyr then was moved, but the demon
not even then enjoyed freedom from fear, but straightway learned
that it is possible to move the bones of a martyr, but not to
escape his hands. For as soon as the coffin was drawn into the
city, a thunderbolt came from above upon the head of his image, and
burnt it all up. And yet, if not before, then at least there was
likelihood that the impious emperor would be angry, and that he
would send forth his anger against the testimony of the martyr. But
not even then did he dare, so great fear possessed him. But
although he saw that the burning was intolerable, and knew the
cause accurately; he kept quiet. And this is not only wonderful
that he did not destroy the testimony, but that he not even dared
to put the roof on to the temple again. For he knew, he knew, that
the stroke was divinely sent, and he feared lest by forming any
further plan, he should call down that fire upon his own head. On
this account he endured to see the shrine of Apollo brought to so
great desolation; For there was no other cause, on account of which
he did not rectify that which had happened, but fear alone. For
which reason he unwillingly kept quiet, and knowing this left as
much reproach to the demon, as distinction to the martyr. For the
walls are now standing, instead of trophies, uttering a voice
clearer than a trumpet. To those in Daphne, to those in the city,
to those who arrive from far off, to those who are with us, to
those men which shall be hereafter, they declare everything by
their appearance, the wrestling, the struggle, the victory of the
martyr. For it is likely that he who dwells far off from the
suburb, when he sees the chapel of the saint deprived of a shrine,
and the temple of Apollo deprived of its roof would ask the reason
of each of these things; and then after learning the whole history
would depart hence. Such are the noble deeds of the martyr after
death, wherefore I count your city blessed, that ye have shown much
zeal about this holy man. For then, when he returned from Daphne,
all our city poured forth into the road, and the market places were
empty of men, and the houses were empty of women, and the
bedchambers were destitute of maidens. Thus also every age and each
sex passed forth from the city, as if to receive a father long
absent who was returning from sojourn far away. And you indeed gave
him back to the band of fellow enthusiasts. But the grace of God
did not suffer him to remain there for good, but again removed him
beyond the river,<note place="end" n="387" id="vii.iv-p14.1"><p class="endnote" id="vii.iv-p15"> Viz., to the church built on the other side of the
Orontes, where the reliques of the saint finally remained.</p></note> so that many
parts of the country were filled with the sweet savor of the
martyr. Neither even when he came hither was he destined to be
alone, but he quickly received, a neighbor, and a fellow-lodger,
and one of similar life.<note place="end" n="388" id="vii.iv-p15.1"><p class="endnote" id="vii.iv-p16"> Meletius, Bishop of Antioch, a man of very saintly
life who died in 379 and was buried by the side of St. Babylas in
the church which he had been active in erecting, mentioned in the
preceding note.</p></note> For he shared with him the same
dignity, and for the sake of religion shewed forth equal boldness.
Wherefore he obtained the same abode as he, this wonderful man
being no vain imitator, as it seems, of the martyr. For for so long
a time he laboured there, sending letters continually to the
emperor, wearying the authorities, and bringing the ministry of the
body to bear upon the martyr. For ye know, doubtless, and remember
that when the midday summer sun possessed the heaven, he together
with his acquaintances, used to walk thither everyday, not as
spectator only, but also, as intending to be a sharer in what was
going on. For he often handled stone, and dragged a rope, and
listened, in advance of the workmen themselves, to one who wanted
to erect any building. For he knew, he knew what rewards lie in
store for him for these things. And on this account he continued
doing service to the martyrs, not only by splendid buildings nor
even by continual feasts, but by a better method than these. And
what is this? He imitates their life, emulates their courage,
throughout according to his ability he keeps the image of the
martyrs alive, in himself. For see, they gave their bodies to the
slaughter, he has mortified the members of his flesh which are upon
the earth. They stopped the flame of fire, he quenched the flame of
lust. They fought against the teeth of beasts, but this man bore
off the most dangerous of our passions, anger. For all these things
let us give thanks to God, because he hath thus granted us noble
martyrs, and pastors worthy of martyrs, for the perfecting of the
saints, for the edifying of the body of Christ<note place="end" n="389" id="vii.iv-p16.1"><p class="endnote" id="vii.iv-p17"> <scripRef passage="Eph. iv. 12" id="vii.iv-p17.1" parsed="|Eph|4|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Eph.4.12">Eph. iv.

<p class="c37" id="viii.ii-p6"><span class="c12" id="viii.ii-p6.1">There</span> is an allusion at the
beginning of this Homily to some remarks recently made on the
parable of the Pharisee and the Publican. These occur in
Chrysostom’s fifth Homily against the Anomœans, one of a set of
Homilies which, from internal evidence, may be assigned to the
close of the year 386, or beginning of 387. The following homily
therefore was delivered at Antioch, probably just before Christmas
386. There were some persons who explained the words of St. Paul
cited in the title as signifying that provided Christ was preached
it mattered not whether the actual doctrines taught were true or
heretical. The main object of the homily is to vindicate the
language of the Apostle from this erroneous and mischievous
interpretation.</p>

<div2 title="Concerning Lowliness of Mind." shorttitle="" progress="26.67%" prev="viii.ii" next="ix" id="viii.iii"><p class="c9" id="viii.iii-p1">

1. When lately we made mention
of the Pharisee and the publican, and hypothetically yoked two
chariots out of virtue and vice;<note place="end" n="390" id="viii.iii-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="viii.iii-p2"> Chrysostom is referring to his Homily “on the
incomprehensible: against the Anomœans,” v. 6, 7. ῞<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="viii.iii-p2.1">Αρματα δύο

horses being Righteousness and Pride; the publican’s, Sin and
Humility.</p></note> we pointed out each truth, how
great is the gain of humbleness of mind, and how great the damage
of pride. For this, even when conjoined with righteousness and
fastings and tithes, fell behind; while that, even when yoked with
sin, out-stripped the Pharisee’s pair, even although the
charioteer it had was a poor one. For what was worse than the
publican? But all the same since he made his soul contrite, and
called himself a sinner; which indeed he was; he surpassed the
Pharisee, who had both fastings to tell of and tithes; and was
removed from any vice. On account of what, and through what?
Because even if he was removed from greed of gain and robbery, he
had rooted over his soul<note place="end" n="391" id="viii.iii-p2.2"><p class="endnote" id="viii.iii-p3"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="viii.iii-p3.1">'Επὶ τῆς ψυχῆς</span>  The
fibres spreading and entwining over it.</p></note> the mother of all
evils—vain-glory and pride. On this account Paul also exhorts and
says “Let each one prove his own work; and then he will have his
ground of boasting for himself, and not for the other.” Whereas
he publicly came forward<note place="end" n="392" id="viii.iii-p3.2"><p class="endnote" id="viii.iii-p4"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="viii.iii-p4.1">Παρῆλθεν</span>. The
word used at Athens of orators rising to speak. <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="viii.iii-p4.2">Παρελθών δ™ žλεξε τοι€δε</span>  <i>Thucyd</i>. ii. 59.</p></note> as an accuser of the whole world;<note place="end" n="393" id="viii.iii-p4.3"><p class="endnote" id="viii.iii-p5"> Fox said in parliament, “I cannot draw an
indictment against humanity.”</p></note> and said
that he himself was better than all living men. And yet even if he
had set himself before ten only, or if five, or if two, or if one,
not even was this endurable; but as it was, he not only set himself
before the whole world, but also accused all men. On this account
he fell behind in the running. And just as a ship, after having run
through innumerable surges, and having escaped many storms, then in
the very mouth of the harbour having been dashed against some rock,
loses the whole treasure which is stowed away in her—so truly did
this Pharisee, after having undergone the labours of the fasting,
and of all the 
<pb n="148" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_148.html" id="viii.iii-Page_148" />rest of his virtue, since he did not master
his tongue, in the very harbour underwent shipwreck of his cargo.<note place="end" n="394" id="viii.iii-p5.1"><p class="endnote" id="viii.iii-p6"> This must be the sense; though there is some little
difficulty in the original.</p></note> For the
going home from prayer, whence he ought to have derived gain,
having rather been so greatly damaged, is nothing else than
undergoing shipwreck in harbour.</p>

<p class="c10" id="viii.iii-p7">2. Knowing therefore these things, beloved
even if we should have mounted to the very pinnacle of virtue, let
us consider ourselves last of all; having learned that pride is
able to cast down even from the heavens themselves him who takes
not heed, and humbleness of mind to bear up on high from the very
abyss of sins him who knows how to be sober. For this it was that
placed the publican before the Pharisee; whereas that, pride I mean
and an overweening spirit, surpassed even an incorporeal power,
that of the devil; while humbleness of mind and the acknowledgment
of his own sins committed brought the robber into Paradise before
the Apostles. Now if the confidence which they who confess their
own sins effect for themselves is so great, they who are conscious
to themselves of many good qualities, yet humble their own souls,
how great crowns will they not win.<note place="end" n="395" id="viii.iii-p7.1"><p class="endnote" id="viii.iii-p8"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="viii.iii-p8.1">ἐπιτεύξονται</span>, Lit. light upon: as on

with humbleness of mind it runs with such ease as to pass and
out-strip righteousness combined with pride. If therefore thou have
put it to with righteousness, whither will it not reach? through

much confidence. On the other hand if pride, having been yoked with
righteousness, by the excess and weight of its own wickedness had
strength enough to drag down <i>its</i> confidence; if it be put
together with sinfulness, into how deep a hell will it not be able
to precipitate him who has it? These things I say, not in order
that we should be careless of righteousness, but that we should
avoid pride; not that we should sin, but that we should be
sober-minded. For humbleness of mind is the foundation of the love
of wisdom which pertains to us. Even if thou shouldest have built a
superstructure of things innumerable; even if almsgiving, even if
prayers, even if fastings, even if all virtue; unless this have
first been laid as a foundation, all will be built upon it<note place="end" n="397" id="viii.iii-p9.1"><p class="endnote" id="viii.iii-p10"> That is on whatever foundation, other than that

apostolic saying which has been to-day read; seeming as it does to
many to afford a pretext for indolence; so that some may not,
providing for themselves hence a certain frigid defence, neglect
their own salvation—to this let us direct our discourse. What
then is this saying? “Whether in pretence,” it says, “or in

happens, without reading what precedes and what comes after it; but
having cut it off from the sequence of the remaining members, to
the destruction of their own soul they put it forward to the more
indolent. For attempting to seduce them from the sound faith; then
seeing them afraid and trembling; on the ground of its not being
without danger to do this,<note place="end" n="404" id="viii.iii-p17.2"><p class="endnote" id="viii.iii-p18"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="viii.iii-p18.1">τουτο

fears, they bring forward this apostolic declaration, saying, Paul
conceded this, by saying, “Whether in pretence or in sincerity,
let Christ be proclaimed.” But these things are not (true), they
are not. For in the first place he did not say “let him be
proclaimed,” but “he is proclaimed,” and the difference
between this and that is wide. For the saying “let him be
proclaimed” belongs to a lawgiver; but the saying “he is
proclaimed” to one announcing the event. For that Paul does not
ordain a law that there should be heresies, but draws away all who
attended to him, hear what he says, “If any one preaches to you a
gospel besides what ye have received, let him be ana<pb n="149" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_149.html" id="viii.iii-Page_149" />thema, were it even I, were it

both himself and an angel, if he had known the act to be without
danger. And again— “I am jealous of you with a jealousy of
God,” he says; “for I have betrothed you to one husband a
chaste virgin: and fear lest at some time, as the serpent beguiled
Eve by his wiliness, so your thoughts should be corrupted from the
singleness that is towards Christ.”<note place="end" n="406" id="viii.iii-p19.2"><p class="endnote" id="viii.iii-p20"> <scripRef passage="2 Cor. xi. 2, 3" id="viii.iii-p20.1" parsed="|2Cor|11|2|11|3" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.11.2-2Cor.11.3">2 Cor. xi.

and granted no allowance. For if there were allowance, there was no

form of wickedness; when he saw Paul having lighted a lamp
throughout the world; (the word of his teaching;) and reproving his
wickedness, exerted himself both to extinguish what was preached,
and to put the teachers out of the way; in order that he might be
allowed with authority to do anything he pleased; and after binding
that holy man, cast him into prison. It was at that time then that
the blessed Paul wrote these things. Who would not have been
astounded? who would not have marvelled? or rather who could
adequately have been astounded at and admired that noble and
heaven-reaching soul; in that, while bound in Rome and imprisoned,
at so great a distance as that, he wrote a letter to the
Philippians? For you know how great is the distance between
Macedonia and Rome. But neither did the length of the way, nor the
amount of time (required), nor the press of business, nor the peril
and the dangers coming one upon another, nor anything else, drive
out his love for and remembrance of the disciples; but he retained
them all in his mind; and not so strongly were his hands bound with
the chains as his soul was bound together and rivetted by his
longing for the disciples:<note place="end" n="414" id="viii.iii-p28.1"><p class="endnote" id="viii.iii-p29"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="viii.iii-p29.1">Πόθῳ</span>,

taken place among themselves; and he administered more business
than the reigning monarch in proportion to his having had a larger
dominion entrusted to him. For in truth God had brought and put
into his hands not those who inhabited the country of the Romans
only, but also all the barbarians, both land and sea. And by way of
showing this he said to the Romans, “Now I would not that ye
should be ignorant, brethren, that ofttimes I have purposed to come
to you, and have been hindered until the present; in order that I
might have some fruit also among you, as among the rest of the
Gentiles too. Both to Greeks and barbarians, both to wise and those

anxious thought at one moment for Corinthians, at another for

Athenians, how they who inhabited Pon<pb n="150" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_150.html" id="viii.iii-Page_150" />tus, how all together were. But all
the same, having had the whole world put into his hands, he
continually cared not for entire nations only, but also for each
single man; and now indeed he despatched a letter on behalf of
Onesimus, and now on behalf of him who among the Corinthians had
committed fornication. For neither used he to regard this—that it
was the individual who had sinned and needed advocacy; but that it
was a human being; a human being, the living thing most precious to
God; and for whose sake the Father had not spared even the
Only-begotten.</p>

<p class="c10" id="viii.iii-p33">5. For do not tell me that this or that man is
a runaway slave, or a robber or thief, or laden with countless
faults, or that he is a mendicant and abject, or of low value and
worthy of no account; but consider that for his sake the Christ
died; and this sufficeth thee for a ground for all solicitude.
Consider what sort of person <i>he</i> must be, whom Christ valued
at so high a price as not to have spared even his own blood. For
neither, if a king had chosen to sacrifice himself on any one’s
behalf, should we have sought out another demonstration of his
being some one great and of deep interest to the King—I fancy
not—for his death would suffice to show the love of him who had
died towards him. But as it is not man, not angel, not archangel;
but the Lord of the heavens himself, the only-begotten Son of God
himself having clothed himself with flesh, freely gave himself on
our behalf. Shall we not do everything, and take every trouble, so
that the men who have been thus valued may enjoy every solicitude
at our hands? And what kind of defence shall we have? what
allowance? This at least is the very thing by way of declaring
which Paul also said, “Do not by thy meat destroy him for whose
sake Christ died.”<note place="end" n="418" id="viii.iii-p33.1"><p class="endnote" id="viii.iii-p34"> <scripRef passage="Rom. xiv. 15" id="viii.iii-p34.1" parsed="|Rom|14|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.14.15">Rom. xiv.

what used to cause anxiety to all others, that to him afforded

whole camp into flight; and if any one have carried a shepherd away
from the flock, the security with which he drives off the sheep is
great. But not in Paul’s case was it thus, but the contrary
entirely. For the leader of the army was bound, and the soldiers
became more forward in the spirit; and the confidence with which
they sprung upon their adversaries was greater: the shepherd was in
confinement, and the sheep were not consumed, nor even

How! It was because they had been schooled, from the grace of the
Spirit, that these things took place not out of weakness, but out
of the permission of the Christ; in order that the truth might
shine abroad more largely; through bonds and imprisonments and
tribulations and straits increasing and rising, to a greater

state, some of the enemies of Paul, desiring to fan up the war to
greater vehemence, and to make the hatred of the tyrant, which was
felt towards him greater, pretended that they themselves also
preached; (and they did preach the right and sound faith,) for the
sake of the doctrine advancing more rapidly: and this they did, not
with the desire to disseminate the faith; but in order that Nero,
having learnt that the preaching was increasing and the doctrine
advancing, might the sooner have Paul led away to execution.<note place="end" n="448" id="viii.iii-p68.1"><p class="endnote" id="viii.iii-p69"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="viii.iii-p69.1">Τὀ

therefore two schools; that of Paul’s scholars and that of
Paul’s enemies; the one preaching out of sincerity, and the
others out of love of contention and the hatred they felt towards
Paul. And by way of declaring this he said, “Some indeed through
envy and strife are preaching Christ,” (pointing out those his
enemies) “but some also through good pleasure;”<note place="end" n="449" id="viii.iii-p69.4"><p class="endnote" id="viii.iii-p70"> That is, heartily.</p></note> saying this

this saying taken in reference to heresies. For those who then were
preaching were not preaching corrupt doctrine; but sound and right
belief. For if they were preaching corrupt doctrine, and were
teaching other things contrary to Paul, what they desired was
certain not to succeed to them. Now what did they desire? That the
faith having grown, and the disciples of Paul having become
numerous, it should rouse Nero to greater hostility. And if they
were preaching different doctrines, they would not have made the
disciples of Paul numerous; and by not doing so,<note place="end" n="454" id="viii.iii-p74.2"><p class="endnote" id="viii.iii-p75"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="viii.iii-p75.1">μὴ ποιοῦντες

preaching itself was not sound. For the preaching does not become
sound when the doctrine is laden with deception; and the pretext
does not become sound when the preaching indeed is sound, but they
who preach do not preach for the sake of God, but either with a
view of enmity, or with a view to the favour of others.</p>

ourselves to those who are aggrieved against us, by the unbroken

demolish their enmity—far more in the case of God would this be
effected.</p>

things to us—these three points I will endeavour to make evident
by the parable which has to-day been read to you. The woman of
Chanaan had come to Christ praying on behalf of a daughter
possessed by a demon, and crying out with much earnestness<note place="end" n="473" id="viii.iii-p96.2"><p class="endnote" id="viii.iii-p97"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="viii.iii-p97.1">̓Εκτεν™ιας</span>,
as above.</p></note> (it says,<note place="end" n="474" id="viii.iii-p97.2"><p class="endnote" id="viii.iii-p98"> φησίν, the parable says.
An instance, however, of its redundancy before noticed. 'Ελ™ησον depends not
on it, but on βοῶσα.</p></note> “Have pity
on me, Lord, my daughter is badly possessed by a demon.”) See,
the woman of a strange nation, and a barbarian, and outside of the

of the receiving her request? For “it is not,” he says, “good
to take the children’s bread, and to give it to the dogs.” But,
all the same, from her assiduity, she became worthy. For not only
did he admit her into the nobility of children, dog as she was; but
also he sent her off with that high encomium saying, “O woman
great is thy faith; be it done to thee as thou wilt.”<note place="end" n="476" id="viii.iii-p99.2"><p class="endnote" id="viii.iii-p100"> <scripRef passage="Matt. xv. 22, 26, 28" id="viii.iii-p100.1" parsed="|Matt|15|22|0|0;|Matt|15|26|0|0;|Matt|15|28|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.15.22 Bible:Matt.15.26 Bible:Matt.15.28">Matt. xv.

that he might repel her<note place="end" n="481" id="viii.iii-p104.3"><p class="endnote" id="viii.iii-p105"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="viii.iii-p105.1">Διακρούσηται</span>,

the woman’s endurance. For if he had delayed in order that he

Christ? “Ye hear a voice, but I see the mind: I know what she is

even if we be in sins, and unworthy of receiving, let us not
despair; knowing, that by assiduity of soul we shall be able to
become worthy of the request. Even if we be unaided by advocate and
destitute, let us not faint; knowing that it is a strong
advocacy—the coming to God one’s self by one’s self with much
eagerness. Even if he delay and defer with respect to the giving,
let us not be dispirited; having learned that the putting it off
and delay is a sure proof of caring and love for mankind. If we
have thus persuaded ourselves; and with a soul deeply pained and
fervent, and thoroughly roused purpose; and such as that with which

<p class="c32" id="ix.ii-p3"><span class="c34" id="ix.ii-p3.1">first instruction.</span></p>

<p class="c9" id="ix.ii-p4">To those about to be illuminated;<note place="end" n="492" id="ix.ii-p4.1"><p class="endnote" id="ix.ii-p5"> <i>I.e</i>., to be baptized. A common name for
Baptism was “illumination,” partly with reference to the
instructions which preceded it, as Justin Martyr says; “The laver
is called illumination because the minds of those who learn these
things are enlightened:” partly also (perhaps rather) because
baptism was regarded as a translation from the kingdom of darkness
into the kingdom of light, the recipient becoming a child of God,
and as such entitled to the grace of the illuminating Spirit.
Catechumens were divided into four classes according to the stages
of their preparation. It is to those who were in the final stage,
the competentes or elect as they were called, that the following
instructions are addressed.</p></note> and for what
reason the laver is said to be of regeneration and not of remission
of sins; and that it is a dangerous thing not only to forswear
oneself, but also to take an oath, even though we swear
truly.</p>

<p class="c9" id="ix.ii-p6">1. <span class="c12" id="ix.ii-p6.1">How</span> delightful and
lovable is our band of young brethren! For brethren I call you,
even now before you have been brought forth, and before your birth
I welcome this relationship with you: For I know, I know clearly,
to how great an honour you are about to be led, and to how great a
dignity; and those who are about to receive dignity, all are wont
to honor, even before the dignity is conferred, laying up for
themselves beforehand by their attention good will for the future.
And this also I myself now do. For ye are not about to be led to an
empty dignity, but to an actual kingdom: and not simply to a
kingdom, but to the kingdom of the Heavens itself. Wherefore I
beseech and entreat you that you remember me when you come into
that kingdom, and as Joseph said to the chief butler “Remember me
when it shall be well with thee,”<note place="end" n="493" id="ix.ii-p6.2"><p class="endnote" id="ix.ii-p7"> <scripRef passage="Gen. xl. 14" id="ix.ii-p7.1" parsed="|Gen|40|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.40.14">Gen. xl.
14</scripRef>.</p></note> this also I say now to you, do ye
remember me when it is well with you. I do not ask this in return
for interpreting your dreams, as he; for I have not come to
interpret dreams for you, but to discourse of matters celestial,
and to convey to you glad tidings of such good things as “eye
hath not seen, and ear hath not heard and which have entered not
into the heart of man, such are the things which God hath prepared
for them that love him.”<note place="end" n="494" id="ix.ii-p7.2"><p class="endnote" id="ix.ii-p8"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. ii. 9, 10" id="ix.ii-p8.1" parsed="|1Cor|2|9|2|10" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.2.9-1Cor.2.10">1 Cor. ii.
9, 10</scripRef>.</p></note> Now Joseph indeed said to that
chief butler, “yet three days and Pharaoh will restore thee to
thy chief butlership.” But I do not say, yet three days and ye
shall be set to pour out the wine of a tyrant, but yet thirty days,
and not Pharaoh but the king of Heaven shall restore you to the
country which is on high, Jerusalem, which is free—to the city
which is in the heavens; and <i>he</i> said indeed, “Thou shalt
give the cup into the hands of Pharaoh.” But I say not that you
shall give the cup into the hands of the king, but that the king
shall give the cup into your hand—that dread cup, full of much
power, and more precious than any created thing. The initiated know
the virtue of this cup, and you yourselves shall know it a little
while hence. Remember me, therefore, when you come into that
kingdom, when you receive the royal robe, when you are girt with
the purple dipped in the master’s blood, when you will be
<pb n="160" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_160.html" id="ix.ii-Page_160" />crowned with the diadem, which
has lustre leaping forth from it on all sides, more brilliant than
the rays of the sun. Such are the gifts of the Bridegroom, greater
indeed than your worth, but worthy of his lovingkindness.</p>

<p class="c10" id="ix.ii-p9">Wherefore, I count you blessed already before those
sacred nuptials, and I do not only count you blessed, but I praise
your prudence in that you have not come to your illumination as the
most slothful among men, at your last breath, but already, like
prudent servants, prepared with much goodwill to obey your master,
have brought the neck of your soul with much meekness and readiness
beneath the bands of Christ, and have received His easy yoke, and
have taken His light burden. For if the grace bestowed be the same
both for you and for those who are initiated at their last hour,
yet the matter of the intention is not the same, nor yet the matter
of the preparation for the rite. For they indeed receive it on
their bed, but you in the bosom of the Church, which is the common
mother of us all; they indeed with lamentation and weeping, but you
rejoicing, and exceeding glad: they sighing, you giving thanks;
they indeed lethargic with much fever, you filled with much
spiritual pleasure; wherefore in your case all things are in
harmony with the gift, but in theirs all are adverse to it. For
there is wailing and much lamentation on the part of the initiated,
and children stand around crying, wife tearing her cheeks, and
dejected friends and tearful servants; the whole aspect of the
house resembles some wintry and gloomy day. And if thou shalt open
the heart of him who is lying there, thou wilt find it more
downcast than are these. For as winds meeting one another with many
a contrary blast, break up the sea into many parts, so too the
thought of the terrors preying upon him assail the soul of the sick
man, and distract his mind with many anxieties. Whenever he sees
his children, he thinks of their fatherless condition; whenever he
looks from them to his wife, he considers her widowhood; when he
sees the servants, he beholds the desolation of the whole house;
when he comes back to himself, he calls to mind his own present
life, and being about to be torn from it, experiences a great cloud
of despondency. Of such a kind is the soul of him who is about to
be initiated. Then in the midst of its tumult and confusion, the
Priest enters, more formidable than the fever itself, and more
distressing than death to the relatives of the sick man. For the
entrance of the Presbyter is thought to be a greater reason for
despair than the voice of the physician despairing of his life, and
that which suggests eternal life seems to be a symbol of death. But
I have not yet put the finishing stroke to these ills. For in the
midst of relatives raising a tumult and making preparations, the
soul has often taken its flight, leaving the body desolate; and in
many cases, while it was present it was useless, for when it
neither recognizes those who are present, nor hears their voice,
nor is able to answer those words by which it will make that
blessed covenant with the common master of us all, but is as a
useless log, or a stone, and he who is about to be illuminated lies
there differing nothing from a corpse, what is the profit of
initiation in a case of such insensibility?</p>

<p class="c10" id="ix.ii-p10">2. For he who is about to approach these holy
and dread mysteries must be awake and alert, must be clean from all
cares of this life, full of much self-restraint, much readiness; he
must banish from his mind every thought foreign to the mysteries,
and on all sides cleanse and prepare his home, as if about to
receive the king himself. Such is the preparation of your mind:
such are your thoughts; such the purpose of your soul. Await
therefore a return worthy of this most excellent decision from God,
who overpowers with His recompense those who show forth obedience
to Him. But since it is necessary for his fellow servants to
contribute of their own, then we will contribute of our own; yea
rather not even are these things our own, but these too are our
Master’s. “For what hast thou,” saith He, “that thou didst
not receive? but if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory, as
if thou hadst not received it?”<note place="end" n="495" id="ix.ii-p10.1"><p class="endnote" id="ix.ii-p11"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. iv. 7" id="ix.ii-p11.1" parsed="|1Cor|4|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.4.7">1 Cor. iv.
7</scripRef>.</p></note> I wished to say this first of all,
why in the world our fathers, passing by the whole year, settled
that the children of the Church should be initiated at this season;
and for what reason, after the instruction from us, removing your
shoes and raiment, unclad and unshod, with but one garment on, they
conduct you to hear the words of the exorcisers. For it is not
thoughtlessly and rashly that they have planned this dress and this
season for us. But both these things have a certain mystic and
secret reason. And I wish to say this to you. But I see that our
discourse now constrains us to something more necessary to say what
baptism is, and for what reason it enters into our life, and what
good things it conveys to us.</p>

<p class="c10" id="ix.ii-p12">But, if you will, let us discourse about the name
which this mystic cleansing bears: for its name is not one, but
very many and various. For this purification is called the laver of
regeneration. “He saved us,” he saith, “through the laver of
regeneration, and renewing of the

this St. Paul again has called it, “For call to remembrance the

conflict of sufferings;”<note place="end" n="497" id="ix.ii-p13.2"><p class="endnote" id="ix.ii-p14"> <scripRef passage="Heb. x. 32" id="ix.ii-p14.1" parsed="|Heb|10|32|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Heb.10.32">Heb. x.

possible to speak of other names besides these, but in order that
we should not spend our whole time over the names of this free
gift, come, return to the first name, and let us finish our
discourse by declaring its meaning; but in the meantime, let us
extend our teaching a little further. There is that laver by means
of the baths, common to all men, which is wont to wipe off bodily
uncleanness; and there is the Jewish laver, more honorable than the
other, but far inferior to that of grace; and it too wipes off
bodily uncleanness but not simply uncleanness of body, since it
even reaches to the weak conscience. For there are many matters,
which by nature indeed are not unclean, but which become unclean
from the weakness of the conscience. And as in the case of little
children, masks, and other bugbears are not in themselves alarming,
but seem to little children to be alarming, by reason of the
weakness of their nature, so it is in the case of those things of
which I was speaking; just as to touch dead bodies is not naturally
unclean, but when this comes into contact with a weak conscience,
it makes him who touches them unclean. For that the thing in
question is not unclean naturally, Moses himself who ordained this
law showed, when he bore off the entire corpse of Joseph, and yet
remained clean. On this account Paul also, discoursing to us about
this uncleanness which does not come naturally but by reason of the
weakness of the conscience, speaks somewhat in this way, “Nothing
is common of itself save to him who accounteth anything to be
common.”<note place="end" n="503" id="ix.ii-p19.2"><p class="endnote" id="ix.ii-p20"> <scripRef passage="Rom. xiv. 14" id="ix.ii-p20.1" parsed="|Rom|14|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.14.14">Rom. xiv.
14</scripRef>.</p></note> Dost thou
not see that uncleanness does not arise from the nature of the
thing, but from the weakness of the reasoning about it? And again:
“All things indeed are clean, howbeit it is evil to that man who
eateth with offense.”<note place="end" n="504" id="ix.ii-p20.2"><p class="endnote" id="ix.ii-p21"> <scripRef passage="Rom. xiv. 20" id="ix.ii-p21.1" parsed="|Rom|14|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.14.20">Rom. xiv.
20</scripRef>.</p></note> Dost thou see that it is not to
eat, but to eat with offense, that is the cause of
uncleanness?</p>

<p class="c10" id="ix.ii-p22">3. Such is the defilement from which the laver
of the Jews cleansed. But the laver of grace, not such, but the
real uncleanness which has introduced defilement into the soul as
well as into the body. For it does not make those who have touched
dead bodies clean, but those who have set their hand to dead works:
and if any man be effeminate, or a fornicator, or an idolator, or a
doer of whatever ill you please, or if he be full of all the
wickedness there is among men: should he fall into this pool of
waters, he comes up again from the divine fountain purer than the
sun’s rays. And in order that thou mayest not think that what is
said is mere vain boasting, hear Paul speaking of the power of the
laver, “Be not deceived: neither idolators, nor fornicators, nor
adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with men, nor
covetous, not drunkards, not revilers, not extortioners shall
inherit the kingdom of God.”<note place="end" n="505" id="ix.ii-p22.1"><p class="endnote" id="ix.ii-p23"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. vi. 9, 10" id="ix.ii-p23.1" parsed="|1Cor|6|9|6|10" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.6.9-1Cor.6.10">1 Cor. vi.
9, 10</scripRef>.</p></note> And what has this to do with what
has been spoken? says one, “for prove the question whether the
power of the laver thoroughly cleanses all these things.” Hear
therefore what follows: “And such were some of you, but ye were
washed, but ye were sanctified, but ye were justified in the name
of the Lord Jesus Christ, and in the spirit of our God.” <i>
We</i> promise to show you that they who approach the laver become
clean from all fornication: but the word has shown more, that they
have become not only clean, but both holy and just, for it does not
say only “ye were washed,” but also “ye were sanctified and
were justified.” What could be more strange than this, when
without toil, and exertion, and good works, righteousness is
produced? For such is the lovingkindness of the Divine gift that it
makes men just without this exertion. For if a letter of the
Emperor, a few words being added, sets free those who are liable to
countless accusations, and brings others to the highest honors;
much rather will the Holy Spirit of God, who is able to do all
things, free us from all evil and grant us much righteousness, and
fill us with much assurance, and as a spark falling into the wide
sea would straightway be quenched, or would become invisible, being
overwhelmed by the multitude of the waters, so also all human
wickedness, when it falls into the pool of the divine fountain, is
more swiftly and easily overwhelmed, 
<pb n="162" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_162.html" id="ix.ii-Page_162" />and made invisible, than that spark. And for what
reason, says one, if the laver take away all our sins, is it
called, not a laver of remission of sins, nor a laver of cleansing,
but a laver of regeneration? Because it does not simply take away
our sins, nor simply cleanse us from our faults, but so as if we
were born again. For it creates and fashions us anew not forming us
again out of earth, but creating us out of another element, namely,
of the nature of water. For it does not simply wipe the vessel
clean, but entirely remoulds it again. For that which is wiped
clean, even if it be cleaned with care, has traces of its former
condition, and bears the remains of its defilement, but that which
falls into the new mould, and is renewed by means of the flames,
laying aside all uncleanness, comes forth from the furnace, and
sends forth the same brilliancy with things newly formed. As
therefore any one who takes and recasts a golden statue which has
been tarnished by time, smoke, dust, rust, restores it to us
thoroughly cleansed and glistening: so too this nature of ours,
rusted with the rust of sin, and having gathered much smoke from
our faults, and having lost its beauty, which He had from the
beginning bestowed upon it from himself, God has taken and cast
anew, and throwing it into the waters as into a mould, and instead
of fire sending forth the grace of the Spirit, then brings us forth
with much brightness, renewed, and made afresh, to rival the beams
of the sun, having crushed the old man, and having fashioned a new
man, more brilliant than the former.</p>

<p class="c10" id="ix.ii-p24">4. And speaking darkly of this crushing, and
this mystic cleansing, the prophet of old said, “Thou shalt dash
them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.”<note place="end" n="506" id="ix.ii-p24.1"><p class="endnote" id="ix.ii-p25"> <scripRef passage="Ps. ii. 9" id="ix.ii-p25.1" parsed="|Ps|2|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.2.9">Ps. ii.

to the faithful, what goes before sufficiently shows us, “For
thou art my Son,” he says, “to-day have I begotten thee, ask of
me and I will give the heathen for three inheritance, the utmost
parts of the earth for thy possession.”<note place="end" n="507" id="ix.ii-p25.2"><p class="endnote" id="ix.ii-p26"> <scripRef passage="Ps. ii. 7, 8" id="ix.ii-p26.1" parsed="|Ps|2|7|2|8" osisRef="Bible:Ps.2.7-Ps.2.8">Ps. ii. 7,
8</scripRef>.</p></note> Dost thou see how he has made
mention of the church of the Gentiles, and has spoken of the
kingdom of Christ extended on all sides? Then he says again,
“Thou shalt rule them with a rod of iron;” not grievous, but
strong: “thou shalt break them in pieces like a potter’s
vessel.”<note place="end" n="508" id="ix.ii-p26.2"><p class="endnote" id="ix.ii-p27"> <scripRef passage="Ps. ii. 9" id="ix.ii-p27.1" parsed="|Ps|2|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.2.9">Ps. ii.
9</scripRef>.</p></note> Behold then,
the laver is more mystically brought forward. For he does not say
earthen vessels: but vessels of the potter. But, give heed: For
earthen vessels when crushed would not admit of refashioning, on
account of the hardness which was gained by them from the fire. But
the fact is that the vessels of the potter are not earthen, but of
clay; wherefore, also, when they have been distorted, they can
easily, by the skill of the artificer, be brought again to a second
shape. When, therefore, God speaks of an irremediable calamity, he
does not say vessels of the potter, but an earthen vessel; when,
for instance, he wished to teach the prophet and the Jews that he
delivered up the city to an irremediable calamity, he bade him take
an earthen wine-vessel, and crush it before all the people, and
say, “Thus shall this city be destroyed, be broken in
pieces.”<note place="end" n="509" id="ix.ii-p27.2"><p class="endnote" id="ix.ii-p28"> <scripRef passage="Jer. xix. 11" id="ix.ii-p28.1" parsed="|Jer|19|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Jer.19.11">Jer. xix.
11</scripRef>.</p></note> But when he
wishes to hold out good hopes to them, he brings the prophet to a
pottery, and does not show him an earthen vessel, but shows him a
vessel of clay, which was in the hands of the potter, falling to
the ground: and brings him to it saying, “If this potter has
taken up and remodelled his vessel which has fallen, shall I not
much rather be able to restore you when you have fallen?”<note place="end" n="510" id="ix.ii-p28.2"><p class="endnote" id="ix.ii-p29"> <scripRef passage="Jer. xviii. 6" id="ix.ii-p29.1" parsed="|Jer|18|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Jer.18.6">Jer.
xviii. 6</scripRef>.</p></note> It is
possible therefore for God not only to restore those who are made
of clay, through the laver of regeneration, but to bring back again
to their original state, on their careful repentance, those who
have received the power of the Spirit, and have lapsed. But this is
not the time for you to hear words about repentance, rather may the
time never come for you to fall into the need of these remedies,
but may you always remain in preservation of the beauty and the
brightness which ye are now about to receive, unsullied. In order,
then, that ye may ever remain thus, come and let us discourse to
you a little about your manner of life. For in the wrestling
schools falls of the athletes are devoid of danger. For the
wrestling is with friends, and they practice all their exercises on
the persons of their teachers. But when the time of the contest has
come, when the lists are open, when the spectators are seated
above, when the president has arrived, it necessarily follows that
the combatants, if they become careless, fall and retire in great
disgrace, or if they are in earnest, win the crowns and the prizes.
So then, in your case these thirty days are like some wrestling
school, both for exercise and practice: let us learn from thence
already to get the better of that evil demon. For it is to contend
with him that we have to strip ourselves, with him after baptism
are we to box and fight. Let us learn from thence already his grip,
on what side he is aggressive, on what side he can easily threaten
us, in order that, when the contest comes on, we may not feel
strange, nor become confused, as seeing new forms of wrestling; but
having already prac<pb n="163" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_163.html" id="ix.ii-Page_163" />ticed them amongst ourselves,
and having learnt all his methods, may engage in these forms of
wrestling against him with courage. In all ways, therefore, is he
accustomed to threaten us, but especially by means of the tongue,
and the mouth. For there is no organ so convenient for him for our
deception and our destruction as an unchastened tongue and an
unchecked utterance. Hence come many slips on our part: hence many
serious accusations against us. And the ease of these falls through
the tongue a certain one showed, when he said, “Many fell by the
sword, but not so many as by the tongue.”<note place="end" n="511" id="ix.ii-p29.2"><p class="endnote" id="ix.ii-p30"> <scripRef passage="Ecclesiasticus 28.22" id="ix.ii-p30.1" parsed="|Sir|28|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Sir.28.22">Ecclus. xxviii. 22</scripRef>.</p></note> Now the gravity of the fall the
same person shows us again when he says: “To slip upon a pavement
is better than to slip with the tongue.”<note place="end" n="512" id="ix.ii-p30.2"><p class="endnote" id="ix.ii-p31"> <scripRef passage="Ecclesiasticus 20.18" id="ix.ii-p31.1" parsed="|Sir|20|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Sir.20.18">Ecclus. xx. 18</scripRef>.</p></note> And what he speaks of is of this
kind. Better it is, says he, that the body should fall and be
crushed, than that such a word should go forth as destroys the
soul; and he does not speak of falls merely; he also admonishes us
that much forethought should be exercised, so that we should not be
tripped up, thus saying “Make a door and bars for thy mouth,”<note place="end" n="513" id="ix.ii-p31.2"><p class="endnote" id="ix.ii-p32"> <scripRef passage="Ecclesiasticus 20.25" id="ix.ii-p32.1" parsed="|Sir|20|25|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Sir.20.25">Ecclus. xx. 25</scripRef>.</p></note> not that we
should prepare doors and bars, but that with much security, we
should shut the tongue off from outrageous words; and again in
another place, after showing that we need influence from above,
both as accompanying and preceding our own effort so as to keep
this wild beast within: stretching forth his hands to God, the
prophet said, “Let the lifting up of my hands be an evening
sacrifice, set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth, keep the door of
my lips;” and he who before admonished, himself too<note place="end" n="514" id="ix.ii-p32.2"><p class="endnote" id="ix.ii-p33"> <scripRef passage="Ps. cxlii. 2, 3" id="ix.ii-p33.1" parsed="|Ps|42|2|42|3" osisRef="Bible:Ps.42.2-Ps.42.3">Ps. cxlii.

“Who shall set a watch before my mouth, and a seal of wisdom upon
my lips?”<note place="end" n="515" id="ix.ii-p33.2"><p class="endnote" id="ix.ii-p34"> <scripRef passage="Ecclesiasticus 22.27" id="ix.ii-p34.1" parsed="|Sir|22|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Sir.22.27">Ecclus. xxii. 27</scripRef>.</p></note> Dost thou
not see, each one fearing these falls and bewailing them, both
giving advice, and praying that the tongue may have the benefit of
much watchfulness? and for what reason, says one, if this organ
brings us such ruin, did God originally place it within us? Because
indeed, it is of great use, and if we are careful, it is of use
only, and brings no ruin. Hear, for example, what he says who spoke
the former words, “Death and life are in the power of the
tongue.”<note place="end" n="516" id="ix.ii-p34.2"><p class="endnote" id="ix.ii-p35"> <scripRef passage="Prov. xviii. 21" id="ix.ii-p35.1" parsed="|Prov|18|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Prov.18.21">Prov.

points to the same thing when he says, “By thy words thou shalt
be condemned, and by thy words thou shalt be justified.”<note place="end" n="517" id="ix.ii-p35.2"><p class="endnote" id="ix.ii-p36"> <scripRef passage="Mark xii. 27" id="ix.ii-p36.1" parsed="|Mark|12|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Mark.12.27">Mark xii.
27</scripRef>.</p></note> For the
tongue stands in the midst ready for use on either hand. Thou art
its master. Thus indeed a sword lies in the midst, and if thou use
it against thine enemies, this organ becomes a means of safety for
thee. But if thou thrust its stroke against thyself, not the nature
of the iron, but thine own transgression becomes the cause of thy
slaughter. Let us then take this view of the tongue. It is a sword
lying in the midst; sharpen it for the purpose of accusing thine
own sins. Thrust not the stroke against thy brother. For this
reason God surrounded it with a double fortification; with the
fence of the teeth and the barrier of the lips, that it may not
rashly and without circumspection utter words which are not
convenient. Well, dost thou say it will not endure this? Bridle it
therefore within. Restrain it by means of the teeth, as though
giving over its body to these executioners and making them bite it.
For it is better that when it sins now it should be bitten by the
teeth, than one day when it seeks a drop of water and is parched
with heat, to be unable to obtain this consolation. In many other
ways indeed it is wont to sin, by raillery and blasphemy, by
uttering foul words, by slander, swearing, and perjury.</p>

<p class="c10" id="ix.ii-p37">5. But in order that we may not by saying everything
at once to-day, confuse your minds, we put before you one custom,
namely, about the avoidance of oaths, saying this much by way of
preface, and speaking plainly—that if you do not avoid oaths, I
say not perjury merely, but those too which happen in the cause of
justice, we shall not further discourse upon any other subject. For
it is monstrous that teachers of letters should not give a second
lesson to their children until they see the former one fixed well
in their memory, but that we, without being able to express our
first lessons clearly, should inculcate others before the first are
completed. For this is nothing else than to pour into a perforated
jar. Give great care, then, that ye silence not our mouth. For this
error is grave, and it is exceedingly grave because it does not
seem to be grave, and on this account I fear it, because no one
fears it. On this account the disease is incurable, because it does
not seem to be a disease; but just as simple speech is not a crime,
so neither does this seem to be a crime, but with much boldness
this transgression is committed: and if any one call it in
question, straightway laughter follows, and much ridicule, not of
those who are called in question for their oaths, but of those who
wish to rectify the disease. On this account I largely extend my
discourse about these matters. For I wish to pull up a deep root,
and to wipe out a long-standing evil: I speak not of perjury alone,
but even of oaths in good faith. But so and so, says one, a
forbearing man, consecrated to the priesthood, living in much
self-control and piety, takes an oath. Do not speak to me of this
forbearing person, this 
<pb n="164" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_164.html" id="ix.ii-Page_164" />self-controlled, pious man who is
consecrated to the priesthood; but if thou wilt, add that this man
is Peter, or Paul, or even an angel descended out of heaven. For
not even in such a case do I regard the dignity of their persons.
For the law which I read upon oaths, is not that of the servant,
but of the King: and when the edicts of a king are read, let every
claim of the servants be silent. But if thou art able to say that
Christ bade us use oaths, or that Christ did not punish the doing
of this, show me, and I am persuaded. But if he forbids it with so
much care, and takes so much thought about the matter as to class
him who takes an oath with the evil one (for whatsoever is more
than these, namely, than yea and nay, saith he, is of the devil),<note place="end" n="518" id="ix.ii-p37.1"><p class="endnote" id="ix.ii-p38"> <scripRef passage="Matt. v. 35" id="ix.ii-p38.1" parsed="|Matt|5|35|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.35">Matt. v.
35</scripRef>.</p></note> why dost
thou bring this person and that person forward? For not because of
the carelessness of thy fellow servants, but from the injunctions
of his own laws, will God record his vote against thee. I have
commanded, he says, thou oughtest to obey, not to shelter thyself
behind such and such a person and concern thyself with other
persons’ evil. Since the great David sinned a grievous sin, is it
then safe for us to sin? Tell me: on this account then we ought to
make sure of this point, and only to emulate the good works of the
saints; and if there is carelessness, and transgression of the law
anywhere, we ought to flee from it with great care. For our
reckoning is not with our fellow-servants, but with our Master, and
to him we shall give account for all done in our life. Let us
prepare ourselves therefore for this tribunal. For even if he who
transgresses this law be beyond everything revered and great, he
shall certainly pay the penalty attaching to the transgression. For
God is no respecter of persons. How then and in what way is it
possible to flee from this sin? For one ought to show not only that
the crime is grievous, but to give counsel how we may escape from
it. Hast thou a wife, hast thou a servant, children, friends,
acquaintance, neighbors? To all these enjoin caution on these
matters. Custom is a grievous thing, terrible to supplant, and hard
to guard against, and it often attacks us unwilling and unknowing;
therefore in so far as thou knowest the power of custom, to such an
extent study to be freed from any evil custom, and transfer thyself
to any other most useful one. For as that custom is often able to
trip thee up, though thou art careful, and guardest thyself, and
takest thought, and consideration, so if thou transferrest thyself
to the good custom of abstaining from oaths, thou wilt not be able,
either involuntarily or carelessly, to fall into the fault of
oaths. For custom is really great and has the power of nature. In
order then that we do not continually distress ourselves let us
transfer ourselves to another custom, and ask thou each one of thy
kindred and acquaintance this favor, that he advise thee and exhort
thee to flee from oaths, and reprove thee, when detected in them.
For the watch over thee which takes place on their part, is to them
too counsel and a suggestion to what is right. For he who reproves
another for oaths, will not himself easily fall into this pit. For
much swearing is no ordinary pit, not only when it is about little
matters but about the greatest. And we, whether buying vegetables,
or quarrelling over two farthings, or in a rage with our servants
and threatening them, always call upon God as our witness. But a
freeman, possessed of some barren dignity, thou wouldest not dare
to call upon as witness in the market to such things; but even if
thou attemptedst it, thou wilt pay the penalty of thine insolence.
But the King of Heaven, the Lord of Angels, when disputing both
about purchases and money, and what not, thou draggest in for a
testimony. And how can these things be borne? whence then should we
escape from this evil custom? After setting those guards of which I
spoke round us, let us fix on a specified time to ourselves for
amendment, and adding thereto condemnation if, when the time has
passed, we have not amended this. How long time will suffice for
the purpose? I do not think that they who are very wary, and on the
alert, and watchful about their own salvation, should need more
than ten days, so as to be altogether free from the evil custom of
oaths. But if after ten days we be detected swearing, let us add a
penalty due to ourselves, and let us fix upon the greatest
punishment and condemnation of the transgression; what then is this
condemnation? This I do not fix upon, but will suffer you
yourselves to determine the sentence. So we arrange matters in our
own case, not only in respect of oaths but in respect of other
defects, and fixing a time for ourselves, with most grievous
punishments, if at any time we have fallen into them, shall come
clean to our Master, and shall escape the fire of hell, and shall
stand before the judgment seat of Christ with boldness, to which
may we all attain, by the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord
Jesus Christ, with whom be glory to the Father together with the
Holy Spirit for ever and ever: Amen.</p>

<p class="c9" id="ix.iii-p2">To those about to be illuminated; and concerning
women who adorn themselves with plaiting of hair, and gold, and
concerning those who have used omens, and amulets, and
incantations, all which are foreign to Christianity.</p>

<p class="c9" id="ix.iii-p3">1. <span class="c12" id="ix.iii-p3.1">I have</span> come to ask
first of all for some fruit in return for the words lately said out
of brotherly love to you. For we do not speak in order that ye
should hear simply, but in order that ye should remember what has
been said, and may afford us evidence of this, by your works. Yea,
rather, not us, but, God, who knows the secrets of the heart. On
this account indeed instruction is so called, in order that even
when we are absent, our discourse may instruct your hearts.<note place="end" n="519" id="ix.iii-p3.2"><p class="endnote" id="ix.iii-p4"> Catechism, or oral instruction, “Catechesis,”
in Greek is called by that name. Chrysostom says, a word derived
from ἠχἠ, a
sound, in order that it may “resound” in your minds ἐνηχῆ. It is
impossible to preserve the play upon words in the translation
consistently with an exact rendering.</p></note> And be not
surprised if, after an interval of ten days only, we have come
asking for fruit from the seed sown. For in one day it is possible
at once to let the seed fall, and to accomplish the harvest. For
strengthened not by our own power alone, but by the influence which
comes from God, we are summoned to the conflict. Let as many
therefore as have received what has been spoken, and have fulfilled
it by their works, remain reaching forth to the things which are
before. But let as many as have not yet arrived at this good
achievement, arrive at it straightway, that they may dispel the
condemnation which arises out of their sloth by their diligence for
the future. For it is possible, it is indeed possible for him who
has been very slothful, by using diligence for the future to
recover the whole loss of the time that is past. Wherefore, He
says, “To-day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts,
as in the day of provocation.”<note place="end" n="520" id="ix.iii-p4.1"><p class="endnote" id="ix.iii-p5"> <scripRef passage="Ps. xcv. 8" id="ix.iii-p5.1" parsed="|Ps|95|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.95.8">Ps. xcv.
8</scripRef>.</p></note> And this, He says, exhorting and
counselling us; that we should never despair, but so long as we are
here, should have good hopes, and should lay hold on what is before
us, and hasten towards the prize of our high calling of God. This
then let us do, and let us inquire into the names of this great
gift. For as ignorance of the greatness of this dignity makes those
who are honored with it more slothful, so when it is known it
renders them thankful, and makes them more earnest; and anyhow it
would be disgraceful and ridiculous that they who enjoy such glory
and honors from God, should not even know what the names of it are
intended to show forth. And why do I speak about this gift, for if
thou wilt consider the common name of our race, thou wilt receive
the greatest instruction and incentive to virtue. For this name
“Man,” we do not define according as they who are without
define it, but as the Divine Scripture has bidden us. For a man is
not merely whosoever has hands and feet of a man, nor whosoever is
rational only, but whosoever practices piety and virtue with
boldness. Hear, at least, what he says concerning Job. For in
saying that “there was a man in the land of Ausis,”<note place="end" n="521" id="ix.iii-p5.2"><p class="endnote" id="ix.iii-p6"> This is the Septuagint word for Uz, the situation
of which is a matter of great uncertainty. A curious note at the
end of the book of Job in the Septuagint states that it was on the
borders of the Euphrates.</p></note> he does not
describe him in those terms in which they who are without describe
him, nor does he say this because he had two feet and broad nails,
but he added the evidences of his piety and said, “just, true,
fearing God, eschewing every evil deed,”<note place="end" n="522" id="ix.iii-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="ix.iii-p7"> <scripRef passage="Job i. 1" id="ix.iii-p7.1" parsed="|Job|1|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Job.1.1">Job i.
1</scripRef>.</p></note> showing that this is a man; even as
therefore another says, “Fear God, and keep his commandments,
because this is the whole man.”<note place="end" n="523" id="ix.iii-p7.2"><p class="endnote" id="ix.iii-p8"> <scripRef passage="Eccles. xii. 13" id="ix.iii-p8.1" parsed="|Eccl|12|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Eccl.12.13">Eccles.
xii. 13</scripRef>.</p></note> But if the name man affords such a
great incentive to virtue, much rather the term faithful. For thou
art called faithful on this account, because thou hast faith in
God, and thyself art entrusted from Him with righteousness,
sanctification, cleansing of soul, adoption, the kingdom of heaven.
He entrusted thee with these, and handed them over to thee. Thou in
turn hast entrusted, and handed over other things to him,
almsgiving, prayers, self-control and every other virtue. And why
do I say almsgiving? If thou givest him even a cup of cold water,
thou shalt not indeed lose this, but even this he keeps with care
against that day, and will restore it with overflowing abundance.
For this truly is wonderful, that he does not keep only that which
has been entrusted to him, but in recompensing it increases
it.</p>

<p class="c10" id="ix.iii-p9">This too he has bidden thee do according to thy
power, with what has been entrusted to thee, to extend the holiness
which thou hast received, and to make the righteousness which comes
from the laver brighter, and the gift of grace more radiant; even
as therefore Paul did, increasing all the good things which he
<pb n="166" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_166.html" id="ix.iii-Page_166" />received by his
subsequent labors, and his zeal, and his diligence. And look at the
carefulness of God; neither did he give the whole to thee then, nor
withhold the whole, but gave part, and promised part. And for what
reason did he not give the whole then? In order that thou mightest
show thy faith about Him, believing, on his promise alone, in what
was not yet given. And for what reason again did he not there
dispense the whole, but did give the grace of the Spirit, and
righteousness and sanctification? In order that he might lighten
thy labors for thee, and by what has been already given may also
put thee in good hope for that which is to come. On this account,
too, thou art about to be called newly-enlightened, because thy
light is ever new, if thou wilt, and is never quenched. For this
light of day, whether we will or no, the night succeeds, but
darkness knows not that light’s ray. “For the light shineth in
the darkness, and the darkness apprehended it not.”<note place="end" n="524" id="ix.iii-p9.1"><p class="endnote" id="ix.iii-p10"> <scripRef passage="John i. 5" id="ix.iii-p10.1" parsed="|John|1|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.1.5">John i.
5</scripRef>. οὐ
κατ™λαβεν, overcame it not.</p></note> Not so
bright at least is the world, when the sunbeams come forth, as the
soul shines and becomes brighter when it has received grace from
the Spirit and learns more exactly the nature of the case. For when
night prevails, and there is darkness, often a man has seen a coil
of rope and has thought it was a serpent, and has fled from an
approaching friend as from an enemy, and being aware of some noise,
has become very much alarmed; but when the day has come, nothing of
this sort could happen, but all appears just as it really is; which
thing also occurs in the case of our soul. For when grace has come,
and driven away the darkness of the understanding, we learn the
exact nature of things, and what was before dreadful to us becomes
contemptible. For we no longer fear death, after learning exactly,
from this sacred initiation, that death is not death, but a sleep
and a seasonable slumber; nor poverty nor disease, nor any other
such thing, knowing that we are on our way to a better life,
undefiled and incorruptible, and free from all such
vicissitudes.</p>

<p class="c10" id="ix.iii-p11">2. Let us not therefore remain craving after
the things of this life, neither after the luxury of the table, or
costliness of raiment. For thou hast the most excellent of raiment,
thou hast a spiritual table thou hast the glory from on high, and
Christ is become to thee all things, thy table, thy raiment, thy
home, thy head, thy stem. “For as many of you as were baptized
into Christ, did put on Christ.”<note place="end" n="525" id="ix.iii-p11.1"><p class="endnote" id="ix.iii-p12"> <scripRef passage="Gal. iii. 27" id="ix.iii-p12.1" parsed="|Gal|3|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gal.3.27">Gal. iii.

18</scripRef>.</p></note> and not this
only, but His members, and His body. For as if what has been said
were not enough to show forth the love and the good will which He
has shown forth towards us, He has added another thing greater and
nearer still, calling himself besides, our head. Knowing all these
matters, beloved, requite thy benefactor by the best conversation,
and considering the greatness of the sacrifice, adorn the members
of thy body; consider what thou receivest in thine hand, and never
suffer it to strike any one, nor shame what has been honored with
so great a gift by the sin of a blow. Consider what thou receivest
in thine hand, and keep it clean from all covetousness and
extortion; think that thou dost not receive this in thy hand, but
also puttest it to thy mouth, and guard thy tongue in purity from
base and insolent words, blasphemy, perjury, and all other such
things. For it is disastrous that what is ministered to by such
most dread mysteries, and has been dyed red with such blood, and
has become a golden sword, should be perverted to purposes of
raillery, and insult, and buffoonery. Reverence the honor with
which God has honoured it, and bring it not down to the vileness of
sin, but having reflected again that after the hand and the tongue,
the heart receives this dread mystery, do not ever weave a plot
against thy neighbor, but keep thy thoughts pure from all evil.
Thus thou shalt be able to keep thine eyes too, and thy hearing
safe. For is it not monstrous, after this mystic voice is borne
from heaven—I mean the voice of the Cherubim—to defile thy
hearing with lewd songs, and dissolute melodies? and does it not
deserve the utmost punishment if, with the same eyes with which
thou lookest upon the unspeakable and dread mysteries, thou lookest
upon harlots, and dost commit adultery in thy heart. Thou art
called to a marriage, beloved: enter not in clad in sordid raiment,
but take a robe suitable to the 
<pb n="167" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_167.html" id="ix.iii-Page_167" />marriage. For if when men are called to a
material marriage, though they be poorer than all others, they
often possess themselves of or buy clean raiment, and so go to meet
those who called them. Do thou too who hast been called to a
spiritual marriage, and to a royal banquet, consider what kind of
raiment it would be right for thee to buy, but rather there is not
even need to purchase, yea he himself who calls thee gives it thee
gratis, in order that thou mayest not be able to plead poverty in
excuse. Keep, therefore, the raiment which thou receivedst. For if
thou losest it, thou wilt not be able to use it henceforth, or to
buy it. For this kind of raiment is nowhere sold. Hast thou heard
how those who were initiated, in old time, groaned, and beat their
breasts, their conscience thereupon exciting them? Beware then,
beloved, that thou do not at any time suffer like this. But how
wilt thou not suffer, if thou dost not cast off the wicked habit of
evil men? For this reason I said before, and speak now and will not
cease speaking, if any has not rectified the defects in his morals,
nor furnished himself with easily acquired virtue, let him not be
baptized. For the laver is able to remit former sins, but there is
no little fear, and no ordinary danger lest we return to them, and
our remedy become a wound. For by how much greater the grace is, by
so much is the punishment more for those who sin after these
things.</p>

<p class="c10" id="ix.iii-p20">3. In order, therefore, that we return not to
our former vomit, let us henceforward discipline ourselves. For
that we must repent beforehand, and desist from our former evil,
and so come forward for grace, hear what John says, and what the
leader of the apostles says to those who are about to be baptized.
For the one says, “Bring forth fruit worthy of repentance, and
begin not to say within yourselves, we have Abraham to our
Father;”<note place="end" n="533" id="ix.iii-p20.1"><p class="endnote" id="ix.iii-p21"> <scripRef passage="Luke iii. 8" id="ix.iii-p21.1" parsed="|Luke|3|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.3.8">Luke iii.
8</scripRef>.</p></note> and the
other says again to those who question him, “Repent ye and be
baptized every one of you in the name of the Lord Jesus
Christ.”<note place="end" n="534" id="ix.iii-p21.2"><p class="endnote" id="ix.iii-p22"> <scripRef passage="Acts ii. 38" id="ix.iii-p22.1" parsed="|Acts|2|38|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.2.38">Acts ii.
38</scripRef>.</p></note> Now he who
repents, no longer touches the same matters of which he repented.
On this account, also, we are bidden to say, “I renounce thee,
Satan,” in order that we may never more return to him.<note place="end" n="535" id="ix.iii-p22.2"><p class="endnote" id="ix.iii-p23"> Alluding to the vow of renunciation made by
converts at baptism. A specimen of this vow may be read in the
so-called Apostolic Constitutions, vii. c. 42. “I renounce Satan
and his works, and his pomps, and his service, and his angels, and
his inventions, and all things that belong or are subject to
him.” This vow of renunciation was uttered by the catechumens in
the porch or ante-chamber of the baptistery with outstretched
hands, and faces turned westwards. See below in Chapter V.</p></note> As therefore
happens in the case of painters from life, so let it happen in your
case. For they, arranging their boards, and tracing white lines
upon them, and sketching the royal likeness in outline, before they
apply the actual colors, rub out some lines, and change some for
others, rectifying mistakes, and altering what is amiss with all
freedom. But when they put on the coloring for good, it is no
longer in their power to rub out again, and to change one thing for
another, since they injure the beauty of the portrait, and the
result becomes an eyesore. Consider that thy soul is the portrait;
before therefore the true coloring of the spirit comes, wipe out
habits which have wrongly been implanted in thee, whether swearing,
or falsehood, or insolence, or base talking, or jesting, or
whatever else thou hast a habit of doing of things unlawful. Away
with the habit, in order that thou mayest not return to it, after
baptism. The laver causes the sins to disappear. Correct thy
habits, so that when the colors are applied, and the royal likeness
is brought out, thou mayest no more wipe them out in the future;
and add damage and scars to the beauty which has been given thee by
God.<note place="end" n="536" id="ix.iii-p23.1"><p class="endnote" id="ix.iii-p24"> The illustration is that of a portrait-painter
making a likeness of the emperor, and there seems to be an allusion
also to the divine image in which man was originally made.</p></note> Restrain
therefore anger, extinguish passion. Be not thou vexed, be
sympathizing, be not exasperated, nor say, “I have been injured
in regard to my soul.” No one is injured in regard to the soul if
we do not injure ourselves in regard to the soul; and how this is,
I now say. Has any one taken away thy substance? He has not injured
thee in regard to thy soul, but thy money. But if thou cherish
ill-will against him, thou hast injured thyself in regard to thy
soul. For the money taken away has wrought thee no damage, nay has
even been profitable, but thou by not dismissing thine anger wilt
give account in the other world for this cherishing of ill-will.
Has any one reviled thee and insulted thee. He has in no way
injured thy soul, and not even thy body. Hast thou reviled in
return and insulted? Thou hast injured thyself in regard to thy
soul, for for the words which thou hast said thou art about to
render account there; and this I wish you to know chiefly of all,
that the Christian, and faithful man, no one is able to injure in
regard to the soul, not even the devil himself; and not only is
this wonderful, that God hath made us inaccessible to all his
designs, but that he has constituted us fit for the practice of
virtue, and there is no hinderance, if we will, even though we be
poor, weak in body, outcast, nameless, bondservants. For neither
poverty, nor infirmity, nor deformity of body, nor servitude, nor
any other of such things could ever become a hinderance to virtue;
and why do I say, poor, and a bondservant, <pb n="168" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_168.html" id="ix.iii-Page_168" />and nameless? Even if thou art a
prisoner, not even this would be ever any hinderance to thee as
regards virtue. And how this is I proceed to say. Has any of thy
household grieved thee and provoked thee? dismiss thy wrath against
him. Have bonds, and poverty, and obscurity been any hinderance to
thee in this respect? and why do I say hinderance? They have both
helped and contributed to restrain pride. Hast thou seen another
prospering? do not envy him. For not even in this case is poverty a
bar. Again, whenever thou needest to pray, do so with a sober and
watchful mind, and nothing shall be a bar even in that case. Show
all meekness, forbearance, self-restraint, gravity. For these
things need no external helps. And this especially is the chief
point about virtue, that it has no necessity for wealth, power,
glory, nor anything of that kind, but of a sanctified soul alone,
and it seeks for nothing more. And behold, also, the same thing
happening in respect of grace. For if any one be lame, if he has
had his eyes put out, if he be maimed in body, if he has fallen
into the last extremity of weakness, grace is not hindered from
coming by any of these things. For it only seeks a soul receiving
it with readiness, and all these external things it passes over.
For in the case of worldly soldiers, those who are about to enlist
them for the army seek for stature of body and healthy condition,
and it is not only necessary that he who is about to become a
soldier should have these alone, but he must also be free. For if
anybody be a slave, he is rejected. But the King of Heaven seeks
for nothing of this kind, but receives slaves into his army, and
aged people, and the languid in limb, and is not ashamed. What is
more merciful than this? What could be more kind? For he seeks for
what is in our own power, but they seek for what is not in our
power. For to be a slave or free is not our doing. To be tall,
again, or short is not in our own power, or to be aged, or well
grown, and such like. But to be forbearing and kind, and so forth,
are matters of our own choice; and God demands of us only those
things of which we have control. And quite reasonably. For He does
not call us to grace because of his own need, but because of doing
us kindness; but kings, because of services required by them; and
they carry men off to an outward and material warfare, but He to a
spiritual combat; and it is not only in the case of heathen wars,
but in the case of the games also that one may see the same
analogy. For they who are about to be brought into the theatre, do
not descend to the contest until the herald himself takes them
beneath the gaze of all, and leads them round, shouting out and
saying, “Has any one a charge against this person?” although in
that case the struggle is not concerned with the soul, but with the
body. Wherefore then dost thou demand proofs of nobleness? But in
this case there is nothing of the kind, but all is different, our
contest not consisting of hand locked in hand, but in philosophy of
soul, and excellence of mind. The president of our conflicts does
the opposite. For he does not take us, and lead us round and say,
“Has any one a charge against this man?” but cries out,
“Though all men, though demons, stand up with the devil and
accuse him of extreme and unspeakable crimes, I reject him not, nor
abhor him, but removing him from his accusers, and freeing him from
his wickedness, thus I bring him to the contest. And this is very
reasonable. For there indeed the president contributes nothing
towards the victory, in the case of the combatants, but stands
still in the midst. But here, the President of the contests for
holiness becomes a fellow-combatant, and helper, sharing with them
the conflict against the devil.</p>

<p class="c10" id="ix.iii-p25">4. And not only is this the wonderful thing
that he remits our sins, but that he not even reveals them nor
makes them manifest and patent, nor compels us to come forward into
the midst, and to tell out our errors, but bids us make our defense
to him alone, and to confess ourselves to him. And yet among
secular judges, if any tell any of the robbers or grave-riflers,
when they are arrested, to tell their errors and be quit of their
punishment, they would accede to this with all readiness, despising
the shame through desire of safety. But in this case there is
nothing of this kind, but he both remits the sins, nor compels us
to marshal them in array before any spectators. But one thing alone
he seeks, that he who enjoys this remission should learn the
greatness of the gift. How is it not, therefore, absurd that in
case where he does us service, he should be content with our
testimony only, but in those where we serve him we seek for others
as witnesses, and do a thing for ostentation’s sake? While we
wonder then at his kindliness, let us show forth our doings, and
before all others let us curb the vehemence of our tongue, and not
always be giving utterance. “For in the multitude of words there
wanteth not transgression.”<note place="end" n="537" id="ix.iii-p25.1"><p class="endnote" id="ix.iii-p26"> <scripRef passage="Prov. x. 19" id="ix.iii-p26.1" parsed="|Prov|10|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Prov.10.19">Prov. x.

useful to say, open thy lips. But if there be nothing necessary for
thee to say, be silent, for it is better. Art thou a
handicraftsman? as thou sittest at work, sing psalms. Dost thou not
wish to sing with thy mouth? do this in thine heart; a psalm is a
great com<pb n="169" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_169.html" id="ix.iii-Page_169" />panion.
In this case thou shalt undergo nothing serious, but shalt be able
to sit in thy workshop as in a monastery. For not suitableness of
place, but strictness of morals will afford us quiet. Paul, at
least, pursuing his trade in a workshop suffered no injury to his
own virtue.<note place="end" n="538" id="ix.iii-p26.2"><p class="endnote" id="ix.iii-p27"> <scripRef passage="Acts xviii. 3" id="ix.iii-p27.1" parsed="|Acts|18|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.18.3">Acts
xviii. 3</scripRef>.</p></note> Do not thou
therefore say, How can I, being a handicraftsman and a poor man, be
a philosopher? This is indeed the very reason why thou mayest be a
philosopher. For poverty is far more conducive to piety for us than
wealth, and work than idleness; since wealth is even a hinderance
to those who do not take heed. For when it is needful to dismiss
anger, to extinguish envy, to curb passion, to offer prayer, to
exhibit forbearance and meekness, kindliness and charity, when
would poverty be a bar? For it is not possible by spending money to
accomplish these things, but by exhibiting a right disposition;
almsgiving especially needs money, but even it shines forth in
greater degree through poverty. For she who spent the two mites was
poorer than all men, and yet surpassed all.<note place="end" n="539" id="ix.iii-p27.2"><p class="endnote" id="ix.iii-p28"> <scripRef passage="Luke xxi. 2-4" id="ix.iii-p28.1" parsed="|Luke|21|2|21|4" osisRef="Bible:Luke.21.2-Luke.21.4">Luke xxi.
2–4</scripRef>.</p></note> Let us not then consider wealth to
be anything great, nor gold to be better than clay. For the value
of material things is not owing to their nature, but to our
estimate of them. For if any one would inquire carefully, iron is
much more necessary than gold. For the one contributes to no need
of our life, but the other has furnished us with the greater part
of our needs, ministering to countless arts; and why do I speak of
a comparison between gold and iron? For these stones<note place="end" n="540" id="ix.iii-p28.2"><p class="endnote" id="ix.iii-p29"> Alluding probably to the stones of the building in
which he was speaking.</p></note> are more
necessary than precious stones. For of those nothing serviceable
could be made, but out of these, houses and walls and cities are
erected. But do thou show me what gain could be derived from these
pearls, rather what harm would not happen? For in order that thou
mayest wear one pearl drop, countless poor people are pinched with
hunger. What excuse wilt thou hit upon? what pardon?</p>

<p class="c10" id="ix.iii-p30">Dost thou wish to adorn thy face? Do so not
with pearls, but with modesty, and dignity. So thy countenance will
be more full of grace in the eyes of thy husband. For the other
kind of adorning is wont to plunge him into a suspicion of
jealousy, and into enmity, quarrelsomeness and strife, for nothing
is more annoying than a face which is suspected. But the ornament
of compassion and modesty casts out all evil suspicion, and will
draw thy partner to thee more strongly than any bond. For natural
beauty does not impart such comeliness to the face as does the
disposition of him who beholds it, and nothing is so wont to
produce that disposition as modesty and dignity; so that if any
woman be comely, and her husband be ill affected towards her, she
appears to him the most worthless of all women; and if she do not
happen to be fair of face, but her husband be well affected towards
her, she appears more comely than all. For sentence is given not
according to the nature of what is beheld, but according to the
disposition of the beholders. Adorn thy face then with modesty,
dignity, pity, lovingkindness, charity, affection for thy husband,
forbearance, meekness, endurance of ill. These are the tints of
virtue. By means of these thou wilt attract angels not human beings
to be thy lovers. By means of these thou hast God to commend thee,
and when God receives thee, he will certainly win over thy husband
for thee. For if the wisdom of a man illuminates his countenance,<note place="end" n="541" id="ix.iii-p30.1"><p class="endnote" id="ix.iii-p31"> <scripRef passage="Eccles. viii. 1" id="ix.iii-p31.1" parsed="|Eccl|8|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Eccl.8.1">Eccles.
viii. 1</scripRef>.</p></note> much more
does the virtue of a woman illuminate her face; and if thou
considerest this to be a great ornament, tell me what will be the
advantage of the pearls in that day? But why is it necessary to
speak of that day, since it is possible to show all this from what
happens now. When, then, they who thought fit to revile the emperor
were dragged to the judgment hall, and were in danger of extreme
measures being taken, then the mothers, and the wives, laying aside
their necklaces, and their golden ornaments, and pearls, and all
adornment, and golden raiment, wearing a simple and mean dress, and
besprinkled with ashes, prostrated themselves before the doors of
the judgment hall and thus won over the judges; and if in the case
of these earthly courts of justice, the golden ornaments, and the
pearls, and the variegated dress would have been a snare and a
betrayal, but forbearance, and meekness, and ashes, and tears, and
mean garments persuaded the judge, much more would this take place
in the case of that impartial and dread tribunal. For what reason
wilt thou be able to state, what defense, when the Master lays
these pearls to thy charge, and brings the poor who have perished
with hunger into the midst? On this account Paul said, “not with
braided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly raiment.”<note place="end" n="542" id="ix.iii-p31.2"><p class="endnote" id="ix.iii-p32"> <scripRef passage="1 Tim. ii. 9" id="ix.iii-p32.1" parsed="|1Tim|2|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.2.9">1 Tim. ii.
9</scripRef>.</p></note> For therein
would be a snare. And if we were to enjoy them continually, yet we
shall lay them aside with death. But arising out of virtue there is
all security, and no vicissitude and changeableness, but here it
makes us more secure, and also accompanies us there. Dost thou wish
to possess pearls, and never to lay aside this wealth? Take off all
ornament and place it in the hands 
<pb n="170" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_170.html" id="ix.iii-Page_170" />of Christ through the poor. He will keep all thy
wealth for thee, when He shall raise up thy body with much
radiancy. Then He shall invest thee with better wealth and greater
ornament, since this present is mean and absurd. Consider then whom
thou wishest to please, and for whose sake thou puttest on this
ornament, not in order that the ropemaker and the coppersmith and
the huckster may admire. Then art thou not ashamed, nor blushest
thou when thou showest thyself to them? doing all on their account
whom thou dost not consider worthy of accosting.</p>

<p class="c10" id="ix.iii-p33">How then wilt thou laugh this fancy to scorn? If
thou wilt remember that word, which thou sentest forth when thou
wert initiated, I renounce thee, Satan, and thy pomp, and thy
service. For the frenzy about pearls is a pomp of Satan. For thou
didst receive gold not in order that thou mightest bind it on to
thy body, but in order that thou mightest release and nourish the
poor. Say therefore constantly, I renounce thee, Satan. Nothing is
more safe than this word if we shall prove it by our deeds.</p>

<p class="c10" id="ix.iii-p34">5. This I think it right that you who are
about to be initiated should learn. For this word is a covenant
with the Master. And just as we, when we buy slaves, first ask
those who are being sold if they are willing to be our servants: So
also does Christ. When He is about to receive thee into service, He
first asks if thou wishest to leave that cruel and relentless
tyrant, and He receives covenants from thee. For his service is not
forced upon thee. And see the lovingkindness of God. For we, before
we put down the price, ask those who are being sold, and when we
have learned that they are willing, then we put down the price. But
Christ not so, but He even put down the price for us all; his
precious blood. For, He says, ye were bought with a price.<note place="end" n="543" id="ix.iii-p34.1"><p class="endnote" id="ix.iii-p35"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. vii. 25" id="ix.iii-p35.1" parsed="|1Cor|7|25|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.7.25">1 Cor.
vii. 25</scripRef>.</p></note>
Notwithstanding, not even then does He compel those who are
unwilling, to serve him; but except thou hast grace, He says, and
of thine own accord and will determinest to enroll thyself under my
rule, I do not compel, nor force thee. And <i>we</i> should not
have chosen to buy wicked slaves. But if we should at any time have
so chosen, we buy them with a perverted choice, and put down a
corresponding price for them. But Christ, buying ungrateful and
lawless slaves, put down the price of a servant of first quality,
nay rather much more, and so much greater that neither speech nor
thought can set forth its greatness. For neither giving heaven, nor
earth, nor sea, but giving up that which is more valuable than all
these, his own blood, thus He bought us. And after all these
things, he does not require of us witnesses, or registration, but
is content with the single word, if thou sayest it from thy heart.
“I renounce thee, Satan, and thy pomp,” has included all. Let
us then say this, “I renounce thee, Satan,” as men who are
about in that world at that day to have that word demanded of them,
and let us keep it in order that we may then return this deposit
safe. But Satan’s pomps are theatres, and the circus, and all
sin, and observance of days, and incantations and omens.</p>

<p class="c10" id="ix.iii-p36">“And what are omens?” says one. Often when
going forth from his own house he has seen a one-eyed or lame man,
and has shunned him as an omen. This is a pomp of Satan. For
meeting the man does not make the day turn out ill, but to live in
sin. When thou goest forth, then, beware of one thing—that sin
does not meet thee. For this it is which trips us up. And without
this the devil will be able to do us no harm. What sayest thou?
Thou seest a man, and shunnest him as an omen, and dost not see the
snare of the devil, how he sets thee at war with him who has done
thee no wrong, how he makes thee the enemy of thy brother on no
just pretext; but God has bidden us love our enemies; but thou art
turned away from him who did thee no wrong, having nothing to
charge him with, and dost thou not consider how great is the
absurdity, how great the shame, rather how great is the danger? Can
I speak of anything more absurd? I am ashamed, indeed, and I blush:
But for your salvation’s sake, I am, I am compelled to speak of
it. If a virgin meet him he says the day becomes unsuccessful; but
if a harlot meet him, it is propitious, and profitable, and full of
much business; are you ashamed? and do you smite your foreheads,
and bend to the ground? But do not this on account of the words
which I have spoken, but of the deeds which have been done. See
then, in this case, how the devil hid his snare, in order that we
might turn away from the modest, but salute and be friendly to the
unchaste. For since he has heard Christ saying that “He who
looketh on a woman to desire her, has already committed adultery
with her,”<note place="end" n="544" id="ix.iii-p36.1"><p class="endnote" id="ix.iii-p37"> <scripRef passage="Matt. v. 28" id="ix.iii-p37.1" parsed="|Matt|5|28|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.28">Matt. v.
28</scripRef>.</p></note> and has seen
many get the better of unchastity, wishing by another wrong to cast
them again into sin, by this superstitious observance he gladly
persuades them to pay attention to whorish women.</p>

<p class="c10" id="ix.iii-p38">And what is one to say about them who use charms and
amulets, and encircle their heads and feet with golden coins of
Alexander <pb n="171" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_171.html" id="ix.iii-Page_171" />of Macedon. Are
these our hopes, tell me, that after the cross and death of our
Master, we should place our hopes of salvation on an image of a
Greek king? Dost thou not know what great result the cross has
achieved? It has abolished death, has extinguished sin, has made
Hades useless, has undone the power of the devil, and is it not
worth trusting for the health of the body? It has raised up the
whole world, and dost thou not take courage in it? And what
wouldest thou be worthy to suffer, tell me? Thou dost not only have
amulets always with thee, but incantations bringing drunken and
half-witted old women into thine house, and art thou not ashamed,
and dost thou not blush, after so great philosophy, to be terrified
at such things? and there is a graver thing than this error. For
when we deliver these exhortations, and lead them away, thinking
that they defend themselves, they say, that the woman is a
Christian who makes these incantations, and utters nothing else
than the name of God. On this account I especially hate and turn
away from her, because she makes use of the name of God, with a
view to ribaldry. For even the demons uttered the name of God, but
still they were demons, and thus they used to say to Christ, “We
know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God,”<note place="end" n="545" id="ix.iii-p38.1"><p class="endnote" id="ix.iii-p39"> <scripRef passage="Mark i. 24" id="ix.iii-p39.1" parsed="|Mark|1|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Mark.1.24">Mark i.
24</scripRef>.</p></note> and notwithstanding, he rebuked
them, and drave them away. On this account, then, I beseech you to
cleanse yourselves from this error, and to keep hold of this word
as a staff; and just as without sandals, and cloak, no one of you
would choose to go down to the market-place, so without this word
never enter the market-place, but when thou art about to pass over
the threshold of the gateway, say this word first: I leave thy
ranks, Satan, and thy pomp, and thy service, and I join the ranks
of Christ. And never go forth without this word. This shall be a
staff to thee, this thine armor, this an impregnable fortress, and
accompany this word with the sign of the cross on thy forehead. For
thus not only a man who meets you, but even the devil himself, will
be unable to hurt you at all, when he sees thee everywhere
appearing with these weapons; and discipline thyself by these means
henceforth, in order that when thou receivest the seal<note place="end" n="546" id="ix.iii-p39.2"><p class="endnote" id="ix.iii-p40"> <i>I.e</i>., baptism. So called because of
the covenant then made with God. So Tertullian calls it the <i>
signaculum fidei</i>, the signature of the Christian faith as
circumcision was of the Jewish faith.</p></note> thou mayest
be a well-equipped soldier, and planting thy trophy against the
devil, may receive the crown of righteousness, which may it be the
lot of us all to obtain, through the grace and lovingkindness of
our Lord Jesus Christ, with whom be glory to the Father and to the
Holy Spirit for ever and ever—Amen.</p>

<p class="c32" id="x.ii-p3"><span class="c34" id="x.ii-p3.1">introduction by rev. w. r. w.
stephens.</span></p>

<p class="c9" id="x.ii-p4"><span class="c12" id="x.ii-p4.1">The</span> three following Homilies
are closely connected in subject, and the opening sentence of the
third clearly proves that it was delivered two days after the
second; but it is impossible to say whether that which is placed
first was really delivered before the other two. It must however
have been spoken at Antioch, since Chrysostom refers at the
beginning of it to his sermons “on the obscurity of prophecies”
in which passages occur which clearly imply that he was not then a
Bishop. The second of the three homilies here translated was
delivered in the presence of a Bishop, as is clearly indicated by
the commencement, and as the third was as already mentioned
delivered two days after the second we may safely affirm that they
were all spoken at Antioch when Chrysostom was a presbyter there
under the Episcopate of Flavian.</p>

<p class="c10" id="x.ii-p5">They deal with errors against which Chrysostom
throughout his life most strenuously contended. In an age of great
depravity there seem to have been many who tried to excuse the weak
resistance which they made to evil, both in themselves, and in
others, by maintaining that the world was abandoned to the dominion
of devils, or to the irresistible course of fate. To counteract the
disastrous effects of such philosophy, which surrendered man to the
current of his passions, it was necessary to insist very boldly and
resolutely on the essential freedom of the will, on moral
responsibility, and the duty of vigorous exertion in resisting
temptation. And Chrysostom did this to an extent which some thought
carried him perilously near the errors of the Pelagian heresy. No
one however has described in more forcible language the powerful
hold of sin upon human nature, and the insufficiency of man to
shake it off without the assistance of divine grace. What he does
most earnestly combat, both in the following homilies and very many
others, is the doctrine that evil was an original integral part of
our nature: he maintains that it is not a substantial inherent
force (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="x.ii-p5.1">δύναμις ἐνυπόστατος</span>).
If evil was a part of our nature in this sense it would be no more
reprehensible than natural appetites and affections. We do not try
to alter that which is by nature (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="x.ii-p5.2">φύσει</span>): sin therefore is not by nature, because
by means of education, laws, and punishments we do seek to alter
that. Sin comes through defect in the moral purpose (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="x.ii-p5.3">προαίρεσις</span>). Our first parents fell
through indolence of moral purpose (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="x.ii-p5.4">ῥ‹θυμία</span>) and this is the principal
cause of sin now. They marked out a path which has been trodden
ever since: the force of will has been weakened in all their
posterity: so that though evil is not an inherent part of man’s
nature yet he is readily inclined to it (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="x.ii-p5.5">ὀξυρῥεπὴς πρὸς
κακι€ν</span>); and this tendency must be perpetually
counteracted by vigorous exertion, and a bracing up of the moral
purpose, with the aid of divine grace. Profoundly convinced
therefore on the one hand of a strong and universal tendency to
sin, but on the other of an essential freedom of the will,
Chrysostom sounds alternately the note of warning and
encouragement,—warning against 
<pb n="178" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_178.html" id="x.ii-Page_178" />that weakness, indolence, languor of moral
purpose which occasions a fall,—encouragement to use to the full
all the powers with which man is gifted, in reliance on God’s
forbearance and love, and on His willingness to help those who do
not despair of themselves. Despair is the devil’s most potent
instrument for effecting the ruin of man; for it is that which
prevents him from rising again after he has fallen. St. Paul
repented, and, not despairing, became equal to angels: Judas
repenting, but despairing, rushed into perdition.</p>

<p class="c38" id="x.iii-p2">Against those who say that demons govern human
affairs, and who are displeased at the chastisement of God, and are
offended at the prosperity of the wicked and the hardships of the
just.</p>

<p class="c9" id="x.iii-p3"><span class="c12" id="x.iii-p3.1">I indeed</span> was hoping,
that from the continuance of my discourse, you would have had a
surfeit of my words: but I see that the contrary is happening: that
no surfeit is taking place from this continuance, but that your
desire is increased, that an addition is made not to your satiety
but to your pleasure, that the same thing is happening which the
winebibbers at heathen drinking-bouts experience; for they, the
more they pour down unmixed wine, so much the rather they kindle
their thirst, and in your case the more teaching we inculcate, so
much the rather do we kindle your desire, we make your longing
greater, your love for it the stronger. On this account, although I
am conscious of extreme poverty, I do not cease to imitate the
ostentatious among entertainers, both setting before you my table
continuously, and placing on it the cup of my teaching, filled
full: for I see that after having drunk it all, you retire again
thirsting. And this indeed has become evident during the whole
time, but especially since the last Lord’s Day: For that ye
partake of the divine oracles insatiably, that day particularly
shewed: whereon I discoursed about the unlawfulness of speaking ill
one of another, when I furnished you with a sure subject for self
accusation, suggesting that you should speak ill of your own sins,
but should not busy yourselves about those of other people: when I
brought forward the Saints as accusing themselves indeed, but
sparing others: Paul saying I am the chief of sinners, and that God
had compassion on him who was a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and
injurious,<note place="end" n="547" id="x.iii-p3.2"><p class="endnote" id="x.iii-p4"> <scripRef passage="1 Tim. i. 13, 15" id="x.iii-p4.1" parsed="|1Tim|1|13|0|0;|1Tim|1|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.1.13 Bible:1Tim.1.15">1 Tim. i.

of fire, confessing and saying that they have sinned and
transgressed, and have not kept the commandments of God. Daniel
again makes the same lamentation. When after the enumeration of
these Saints, I called their accusers flies, and introduced the
right reason for the comparison, saying, that just as they fasten
themselves upon the wounds of others, so also the accusers bite at
other people’s sins, collecting disease therefrom for their
acquaintance, and those who do the opposite, I designated bees, not
gathering together diseases, but building honeycombs with the
greatest devotion, and so flying to the meadow of the virtue of the
Saint: Then accordingly—then ye shewed your insatiable longing.
For when my discourse was extended to some length, yea to an
interminable length, such as never was, many indeed expected that
your eagerness would be quenched by the abundance of what was said.
But the contrary happened. For your heart was the rather warmed,
your desire was the rather kindled: and whence was this evident?
The acclamations at least which took place at the end were greater,
and the shouts more clear, and the same thing took place as at the
forge. For as there at the beginning indeed the light of the fire
is not very clear, but when the flame has caught the whole of the
wood that is laid upon it, it is raised to a great height; so also
accordingly this happened on the occasion of that day. At the
beginning indeed, this assembly was not vehemently stirred by me.
But when the discourse was extended to some length, and gradually
took hold of all the subjects and the teaching spread more widely,
then accordingly, then the desire 
<pb n="179" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_179.html" id="x.iii-Page_179" />of listening was kindled in you, and the
applause broke forth, more vehemently. On this account, although I
had been prepared to say less than was spoken, I then exceeded the
measure, nay rather <i>I</i> never exceeded the measure. For I am
wont to measure the amount of the teaching not by the multitude of
the words spoken, but by the disposition of the audience. For he
who meets with a disgusted audience, even if he abridge his
teaching, seems to be vexatious, but he who meets with eager, and
wide-awake, and attentive hearers, though he extend his discourse
to some length, not even thus fulfils their desire.</p>

<p class="c10" id="x.iii-p10">But since it happens that there are in so great a
congregation, certain weak ones, unable to follow the length of the
discourse, I wish to suggest this to them, that they should hear
and receive, as much as they can, and having received enough should
retire: There is no one who forbids, or compels them to remain
beyond their natural strength. Let them not however necessitate the
abridgement of the discourse before the time and the proper hours.
Thou art replete, but thy brother still hungers. Thou art drunk
with the multitude of the things spoken, but thy brother is still
thirsty. Let him then not distress thy weakness, compelling thee to
receive more than thine own power allows: nor do thou vex his zeal
by preventing him from receiving all that he can take in.</p>

<p class="c10" id="x.iii-p11">2. This also happens at secular feasts. Some indeed
are more quickly satisfied, some more tardily, and neither do these
blame those, nor do they condemn these. But there indeed to
withdraw more quickly is praiseworthy, but here to withdraw more
quickly is not praiseworthy, but excusable. There to leave off more
slowly, is culpable and faulty, here to withdraw more tardily,
brings the greatest commendation, and good report. Pray why is
this? Because there indeed the tardiness arises from greediness,
but here the endurance, and patience are made up of spiritual
desire and divine longing.</p>

<p class="c10" id="x.iii-p12">But enough of preamble. And we will proceed hereupon
to that business which remained over to us from that day. What then
was that which was then spoken? that all men had one speech, just
as also they had one nature, and no one was different in speech, or
in tongue. Whence then comes so great a distinction in speech? From
the carelessness of those who received the gift—of both of which
matters we then spoke, shewing both the lovingkindness of the
Master through this unity of speech, and the senselessness of the
servants through their distinction of speech. For he indeed
foreseeing that we should waste the gift nevertheless gave it: and
they to whom it was entrusted, waxed evil over their charge. This
is then one way of explanation, not that God wrested the gift from
us but that we wasted what had been given. Then next after that,
that we received afterwards gifts greater than those lost. In place
of temporal toil he honoured us with eternal life. In place of
thorns and thistles he prepared the fruit of the Spirit to grow in
our souls. Nothing was more insignificant than man, and nothing
became more honoured than man. He was the last item of the
reasonable creation. But the feet became the head, and by means of
the first-fruits, were raised to the royal throne. For just as some
generous and opulent man who has seen some one escape from
shipwreck and only able to save his bare body from the waves,
cradles him in his hands, and casts about him a bright garment, and
conducts him to the highest honours; so also God has done in the
case of our nature. Man cast aside all that he had, his right to
speak freely, his communion with God, his sojourn in Paradise, his
unclouded life, and as from a shipwreck, went forth bare. But God
received him and straightway clothed him, and taking him by the
hand gradually conducted him to heaven. And yet the shipwreck was
quite unpardonable. For this tempest was due entirely not to the
force of the winds, but to the carelessness of the sailor.</p>

<p class="c10" id="x.iii-p13">And yet God did not look at this, but had
compassion for the magnitude of the calamity, and him who had
suffered shipwreck in harbour, he received as lovingly as if he had
undergone this in the midst of the open sea. For to fall in
Paradise is to undergo shipwreck in harbour. Why so? Because when
no sadness, or care, or labours, or toil, or countless waves of
desire assaulted our nature, it was upset and it fell. And as the
miscreants who sail the sea, often bore through the ship with a
small iron tool, and let in the whole sea to the ship from below;
so accordingly then, when the Devil saw the ship of Adam, that is
his soul, full of many good things, he came and bored it through
with his mere voice, as with some small iron tool, and emptied him
of all his wealth and sank the ship itself. But God made the gain
greater than the loss, and brought our nature to the royal throne.
Wherefore Paul cries out and says, “He raised us up with him, and
made us to sit with him, on his right hand in the heavenly places,
that in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his
grace in kindness towards us.”<note place="end" n="553" id="x.iii-p13.1"><p class="endnote" id="x.iii-p14"> <scripRef passage="Eph. ii. 6, 7" id="x.iii-p14.1" parsed="|Eph|2|6|2|7" osisRef="Bible:Eph.2.6-Eph.2.7">Eph. ii.

has an end, and dost thou say “in order that he might shew to the
ages to come?” Has he not shewn? He has already shewn, but not to
all men, but to me who am faithful, but the unbelieving has not yet
seen the wonder. But then, in that day the whole nature of man will
come forward, and will wonder at that which has been done, but
especially will it be more manifest to us. For we believe even now;
but hearing and sight do not put a wonder before us in the same
way, but just as in the case of kings when we hear of the purple
robe, and the diadem, and the golden raiment, and the royal throne,
we wonder indeed, but experience this in greater degree when the
curtains are drawn aside and we see him seated on the lofty
judgment seat. So also in the case of the Only-Begotten, when we
see the curtains of heaven drawn aside, and the King of angels
descending thence, and with his body-guard of the heavenly hosts,
then we perceive the wonder to be greater from our sight of it. For
consider with me what it is to see our nature borne upon the
Cherubim, and the whole angelic force surrounding it.</p>

<p class="c10" id="x.iii-p15">3. But look, with me, too, at the wisdom of
Paul, how many expressions he seeks for, so as to present to us the
lovingkindness of God. For he did not speak merely the word grace,
nor riches, but what did he say? “The exceeding riches of his
grace in kindness.”<note place="end" n="554" id="x.iii-p15.1"><p class="endnote" id="x.iii-p16"> <scripRef passage="Eph. ii. 7" id="x.iii-p16.1" parsed="|Eph|2|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Eph.2.7">Eph. ii.
7</scripRef>.</p></note> But notwithstanding even so, he is
below the mark; and even as the slippery bodies when grasped by
countless hands, escape our hold, and slip through easily; so also
are we unable to get hold of the lovingkindness of God in whatever
expressions we may try to grasp it, but the exceeding magnitude of
it baffles the feebleness of our utterances. And Paul therefore
experiencing this, and seeing the force of words defeated by its
magnitude, desists after saying one word: and what is this?
“Thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift.”<note place="end" n="555" id="x.iii-p16.2"><p class="endnote" id="x.iii-p17"> <scripRef passage="2 Cor. ix. 15" id="x.iii-p17.1" parsed="|2Cor|9|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.9.15">2 Cor. ix.

able to set forth the tender care of God. On this account he then
says that it is past finding out, and elsewhere “The peace of God
which passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts.”<note place="end" n="556" id="x.iii-p17.2"><p class="endnote" id="x.iii-p18"> <scripRef passage="Phil. iv. 7" id="x.iii-p18.1" parsed="|Phil|4|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Phil.4.7">Phil. iv.
7</scripRef>.</p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="x.iii-p19">But, as I was saying, these two ways of explanation
are found in the meantime: one indeed that God has not wrested the
gift that we have lost; and next, that the good things which have
been given to us are even greater than those which we have lost.
And I wish also to mention a third too. What then is the third?
That even if he had not given the things after these, which were
greater than those we had lost, but had only taken away what had
been given to us, as we furnished the reason why, (for let this be
added); even this is enough of itself to shew his tender care
towards us. For not only to give, but also to take away what was
given, is a mark of the greatest lovingkindness, and, if you will,
let us lay bare the matter, in the case of Paradise. He gave
Paradise. This of his own tender care. We were seen to be unworthy
of the gift. This of our own senselessness. He took away the gift
from those who became unworthy of it. This came of his own
goodness. And what kind of goodness is it, says one, to take away
the gift? Wait, and thou shalt fully hear. For think, what Cain
would have been, dwelling in Paradise after his bloodguiltiness.
For if, when he was expelled from that abode, if when condemned to
toil and labour, and beholding the threat of death hanging over his
head, if seeing the calamity of his father before his eyes, and
holding the traces of the wrath of God still in his hands, and
encompassed with so great horrors, he lashed out into such great
wickedness, as to ignore nature, and to forget one born from the
same birth pangs, and to slay him who had done him no wrong, to lay
hold on his brother’s person, and to dye his right hand with
blood, and when God wanted him to be still, to refuse submission
and to affront his maker, to dishonour his parents; if this man had
continued to dwell in Paradise—look, into how great evil he would
have rushed. For if when so many restraints were laid upon him, he
leapt with fatal leaps; and if these walls were set at nought,
whither would he not have precipitated himself?</p>

<p class="c10" id="x.iii-p20">Wouldest thou learn too from the mother of
this man, what a good result the expulsion from the life of
Paradise had, compare what Eve was before this, and what she became
afterwards. Before this indeed, she considered that deceiving
Devil, that wicked Demon to be more worth believing than the
commandments of God, and at the mere sight of the tree, she
trampled under foot the law which had been laid down by Him. But
when the expulsion from Paradise came, consider how much better and
wiser she grew. For when she bare a son, she says “I have gotten
a man through the Lord.”<note place="end" n="557" id="x.iii-p20.1"><p class="endnote" id="x.iii-p21"> <scripRef passage="Gen. iv. 1" id="x.iii-p21.1" parsed="|Gen|4|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.4.1">Gen. iv.
1</scripRef>.</p></note> She straightway flew to the master,
who before this had despised the master, and she neither ascribes
the matter to nature, nor puts the birth down to the laws of
marriage, but she recognizes the Lord of Nature, and acknowledges
thanks to Him for the birth of the little child. And she who before
this deceived her husband, afterwards 
<pb n="181" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_181.html" id="x.iii-Page_181" />even trained the little child, and gave him
a name which of itself was able to bring the gift of God to her
remembrance: and again when she bare another, she says “God hath
raised up seed to me in place of Abel whom Cain slew.”<note place="end" n="558" id="x.iii-p21.2"><p class="endnote" id="x.iii-p22"> <scripRef passage="Gen. iv. 25" id="x.iii-p22.1" parsed="|Gen|4|25|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.4.25">Gen. iv.
25</scripRef>.</p></note> The woman
remembers her calamity, and does not become impatient but she gives
thanks to God, and calls the little child after his gift,
furnishing it with constant material for instruction. Thus even in
his very deprivation God conferred greater benefit. The woman
suffered expulsion from Paradise, but by means of her ejection she
was led to a knowledge of God, so that she found a greater thing
than she lost. And if it were profitable, says one, to suffer
expulsion from Paradise, for what cause did God give Paradise at
the beginning? This turned out profitably to man, on account of our
carelessness, since, if at least, they had taken heed to
themselves, and had acknowledged their master, and had known how to
be self-restrained, and to keep within bounds, they would have
remained in honour. But when they treated the gifts which had been
given them with insolence, then it became profitable, that they
should be ejected. For what cause then did God give at first? In
order that he might shew forth his own lovingkindness, and because
He himself was prepared to bring us even to greater honour. But we
were the cause of chastisement and punishment on all sides,
ejecting ourselves through our indifference to goods which were
given to us. Just as therefore an affectionate father, at first
indeed, suffers his own son to dwell in his home, and to enjoy all
his father’s goods, but when he sees that he has become worthless
of the honour, he leads him away from his table, and puts him far
from his own sight, and often casts him forth from his paternal
home, in order that he, suffering expulsion, and becoming better by
this slight and this dishonour, may again shew himself worthy of
restoration, and may succeed to his father’s inheritance: So has
God done. He gave Paradise to man. He cast him out when he appeared
unworthy, in order that by his dwelling outside, and through his
dishonour, he might become better, and more self-restrained, and
might appear worthy again of restoration. Since after those things
he did become better, he brings him back again and says “To-day
shalt thou be with me in Paradise.”<note place="end" n="559" id="x.iii-p22.2"><p class="endnote" id="x.iii-p23"> <scripRef passage="Luke xxiii. 43" id="x.iii-p23.1" parsed="|Luke|23|43|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.23.43">Luke
xxiii. 43</scripRef>.</p></note> Dost thou see that not the gift of
Paradise but even the ejection from Paradise was a token of the
greatest tender care? For had he not suffered expulsion from
Paradise, he would not again have appeared worthy of
Paradise.</p>

<p class="c10" id="x.iii-p24">4. This argument therefore let us maintain
throughout, and let us apply it to the case of the subject lying
before us. God gave a speech common to all. This is part of his
loving kindness to men. They did not use the gift rightly, but they
lapsed to utter folly. He took away again that which had been
given. For if when they had one speech, they fell into so great
folly, as to wish to build a tower to heaven: had they not
immediately been chastised would they not have desired to lay hold
on the height of heaven itself? For why? If indeed that were
impossible for them, yet notwithstanding their impious thoughts are
made out from their plan. All which things God foresaw, and since
they did not use their oneness of speech rightly, he rightly
divided them by difference of speech. And see with me, his
lovingkindness. “Behold,” saith he “they all have one speech,
and this they have begun to do.”<note place="end" n="560" id="x.iii-p24.1"><p class="endnote" id="x.iii-p25"> <scripRef passage="Gen. xi. 6" id="x.iii-p25.1" parsed="|Gen|11|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.11.6">Gen. xi.
6</scripRef>.</p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="x.iii-p26">For what reason did he not at once proceed to
the division of tongues, but first of all defend himself, as if
about to be judged in a lawcourt? And yet at least no one can say
to him why hast thou thus done? yea he is at liberty to do all
things as he wills. But still as one about to give account, he thus
sets up a defence, teaching us to be gentle and loving. For if the
master defends himself to his servants, even when they have done
him this wrong; much more ought we to defend ourselves to one
another, even if we are wronged to the highest degree. See at least
how he defends himself. “Behold they have all one mouth and one
speech” saith he, “and this they have begun to do,” as if he
said let no one accuse me of this when he sees the division of
tongues. Let no one consider that this difference of speech was
made over to men from the beginning. “Behold they all have one
mouth, and one speech.” But they did not use the gift aright. And
in order that thou mayest understand that he does not chastise for
what has taken place so much as he provides for improvement in the
future, hear the sequel “and now none of all the things will fail
them, which they set on foot to do.”<note place="end" n="561" id="x.iii-p26.1"><p class="endnote" id="x.iii-p27"> <scripRef passage="Gen. xi. 6" id="x.iii-p27.1" parsed="|Gen|11|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.11.6">Gen. xi.
6</scripRef>.</p></note> Now what he says, is of such a kind
as this. If they do not pay the penalty now, and be restrained from
the very root of their sins, they will never cease from wickedness.
For this is what “none of the things will fail them which they
set on foot to do” means, as if he said, and they will add other
deeds yet more monstrous. For such a thing is wickedness; if when
it has taken a start it be not hindered, as fire catching wood, so
it rises to an un<pb n="182" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_182.html" id="x.iii-Page_182" />speakable height. Dost thou see
that the deprivation of oneness of speech was a work of much
lovingkindness? He inflicted difference of speech upon them, in
order that they might not fall into greater wickedness. Hold fast
this argument then with me, and let it ever be fixed and immoveable
in your minds, that not only when he confers benefits but even when
he chastises God is good and loving. For even his chastisements and
his punishments are the greatest part of his beneficence, the
greatest form of his providence. Whenever therefore thou seest that
famines have taken place, and pestilences, and drought and
immoderate rains, and irregularities in the atmosphere, or any
other of the things which chasten human nature, be not distressed,
nor be despondent, but worship Him who caused them, marvel at Him
for His tender care. For He who does these things is such that He
even chastens the body that the soul may become sound. Then does
God these things saith one? God does these things, and even if the
whole city, nay even if the whole universe were here I will not
shrink from saying this. Would that my voice were clearer than a
trumpet, and that it were possible to stand in a lofty place, and
to cry aloud to all men, and to testify that God does these things.
I do not say these things in arrogance but I have the prophet
standing at my side, crying and saying, “There is no evil in the
city which the Lord hath not done”<note place="end" n="562" id="x.iii-p27.2"><p class="endnote" id="x.iii-p28"> <scripRef passage="Amos iii. 6" id="x.iii-p28.1" parsed="|Amos|3|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Amos.3.6">Amos iii.
6</scripRef>.</p></note>—now evil is an ambiguous term;
and I wish that you shall learn the exact meaning of each
expression, in order that on account of ambiguity you may not
confound the nature of the things, and fall into
blasphemy.</p>

<p class="c10" id="x.iii-p29">5. There is then evil, which is really evil;
fornication, adultery, covetousness, and the countless dreadful
things, which are worthy of the utmost reproach and punishment.
Again there is evil, which rather is not evil, but is called so,
famine, pestilence, death, disease, and others of a like kind. For
these would not be evils. On this account I said they are called so
only. Why then? Because, were they evils, they would not have
become the sources of good to us, chastening our pride, goading our
sloth, and leading us on to zeal, making us more attentive. “For
when,” saith one, “he slew them, then they sought him, and they
returned, and came early to God.”<note place="end" n="563" id="x.iii-p29.1"><p class="endnote" id="x.iii-p30"> <scripRef passage="Ps. lxxviii. 34" id="x.iii-p30.1" parsed="|Ps|78|34|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.78.34">Ps.
lxxviii. 34</scripRef>.</p></note> He <i>calls</i> this evil therefore
which chastens them, which makes them purer, which renders them
more zealous, which leads them on to love of wisdom; not that which
comes under suspicion and is worthy of reproach; for that is not a
work of God, but an invention of our own will, but this is for the
destruction of the other. He calls then by the name of evil the
affliction, which arises from our punishment; thus naming it not in
regard to its own nature, but according to that view which men take
of it. For since we are accustomed to call by the name of evil, not
only thefts and adulteries, but also calamities; so he has called
the matter, according to the estimate of mankind. This then is that
which the prophet saith “There is no evil in the city which the
Lord hath not done.” This too by means of Isaiah God has made
clear saying “I am God who maketh peace and createth evil,”<note place="end" n="564" id="x.iii-p30.2"><p class="endnote" id="x.iii-p31"> <scripRef passage="Isa. xlv. 7" id="x.iii-p31.1" parsed="|Isa|45|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.45.7">Isa. xlv.
7</scripRef>.</p></note> again naming
calamities evils. This evil also Christ hints at, thus saying to
the disciples, “sufficient for the day is the evil thereof,”<note place="end" n="565" id="x.iii-p31.2"><p class="endnote" id="x.iii-p32"> <scripRef passage="Matt. vi. 34" id="x.iii-p32.1" parsed="|Matt|6|34|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.6.34">Matt. vi.
34</scripRef>.</p></note> that is to
say the affliction, the misery. It is manifest then on all sides,
that he here calls punishment evil; and himself brings these upon
us, affording us the greatest view of his providence. For the
physician is not only to be commended when he leads forth the
patient into gardens and meadows, nor even into baths and pools of
water, nor yet when he sets before him a well furnished table, but
when he orders him to remain without food, when he oppresses him
with hunger and lays him low with thirst, confines him to his bed,
both making his house a prison, and depriving him of the very
light, and shadowing his room on all sides with curtains, and when
he cuts, and when he cauterizes, and when he brings his bitter
medicines, he is equally a physician. How is it not then
preposterous to call him a physician who does so many evil things,
but to blaspheme God, if at any time He doeth one of these things,
if He bring on either famine or death, and to reject his providence
over all? And yet He is the only true physician both of souls and
bodies. On this account He often seizes this nature of ours
wantoning in prosperity, and travailing with a fever of sins, and
by want, and hunger, and death and other calamities and the rest of
the medicines of which He knows, frees us from diseases. But the
poor alone feel hunger, says one. But He does not chasten with
hunger alone, but with countless other things. Him who is in
poverty He has often corrected with hunger, but the rich and him
who enjoys prosperity, with dangers, diseases, untimely deaths. For
He is full of resources, and the medicines which He has for our
salvation are manifold.</p>

<p class="c10" id="x.iii-p33">Thus too the judges do. They do not honour, or crown
those only who dwell in cities, nor do they provide gifts alone,
but they also <pb n="183" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_183.html" id="x.iii-Page_183" />often correct. On
this account both the sword is sharpened by them, and tortures are
prepared; both the wheel and the stocks, and the executioners, and
countless other forms of chastisement. That which the executioner
is to the judges, famine is to God—as an executioner correcting
us and leading us away from vice. This too, it is possible to see
in the case of the husbandmen: They do not then, only protect the
root of the vine, nor hedge it round but prune it, and lop off many
of the branches; on this account not only have they a hoe, but a
sickle too, suitable for cutting: yet notwithstanding we do not
find fault with them, but then above all we admire them, when we
see them cutting off much that is unserviceable, so as through the
rejection of what is superfluous to afford great security to that
which remains. How is it not then preposterous, that we should thus
approve of a father indeed and a physician and a judge, and a
husbandman, and should neither blame nor censure him who casts his
son out of his house nor the physician who puts his patient to
torture nor the judge who corrects, nor the husbandman who prunes:
but that we should blame and smite with countless accusations God,
if he would at any time raise us up, when we are as it were,
besotted through the great drunkenness which comes of wickedness?
How great madness would it not be, not even to allow God a share of
the same self-justification, of which we allow our fellow servants
a share?</p>

<p class="c10" id="x.iii-p34">6. Fearing these things for them who reproach
God, I speak now, in order that they may not kick against the
pricks, and cover their own feet with blood, that they may not
throw stones to heaven, and receive wounds on their own head. But I
have somewhat else far beyond this to say. For omitting to ask (I
say this by way of concession) if God took from us to our profit, I
only say this; that if He took what had been given, not even thus,
could anyone be able to reproach Him. For He was Lord of his own.
Among men indeed, when they entrust us with money, and lend us
silver, we give them our thanks for the time during which they lent
it, we are not indignant at the time at which they take back their
own. And shall we reproach God who wishes to take back his own?
Indeed now is this not the extreme of folly? yea the great and
noble Job did not act thus. For not only when he received, but even
when he was deprived, he gives the greatest thanks to God saying,
“The Lord gave, the Lord hath taken away; may the name of the
Lord be blessed for ever.”<note place="end" n="566" id="x.iii-p34.1"><p class="endnote" id="x.iii-p35"> <scripRef passage="Job i. 21" id="x.iii-p35.1" parsed="|Job|1|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Job.1.21">Job i.
21</scripRef>.</p></note> But if it is right to give thanks
for both these even separately, and deprivation is not the less
serviceable than bestowal; what excusableness should we have, tell
me, in recompensing in a contrary spirit, and being impatient with
Him when we ought to worship, who is so gentle, and loving and
careful, who is wiser than every Physician, and more full of
affection than any father, juster than any judge, and more anxious
than any husbandman, in healing these souls of ours? What then
could be more insane and senseless than they who in the midst of so
great good order, say that we are deprived of the providence of
God? For just as if some one were to contend that the soul was
murky and cold, he would produce an example of extreme insanity, by
his opinion; so if any one doubts about the providence of God, much
rather is he liable to charges of madness.</p>

<p class="c10" id="x.iii-p36">Not so manifest is the Sun, as the providence
of God is clear. But nevertheless some dare to say that Demons
administer our affairs. What can I do? Thou hast a loving Master.
He chooses rather to be blasphemed by thee through these words,
than to commit thine affairs to the Demons and persuade thee by the
reality how Demons administer. For then thou wouldest know their
wickedness well by the experience of it. But rather indeed now it
is possible to set it before you as it were by a certain small
example. Certain men possessed of Demons coming forth out of the
tombs met Christ, and the Demons kept beseeching him to suffer them
to enter the herd of swine. And he suffered them, and they went
away, and straightway precipitated them all headlong.<note place="end" n="567" id="x.iii-p36.1"><p class="endnote" id="x.iii-p37"> <scripRef passage="Matt. viii. 28" id="x.iii-p37.1" parsed="|Matt|8|28|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.8.28">Matt.
viii. 28</scripRef> sqq.</p></note> Thus do
Demons govern; and yet to them the swine were of no particular
account, but with thee there is ever a warfare without a truce, and
an implacable fight, and undying hatred. And if in the case of
those with whom they had nothing in common they did not even endure
that they should be allowed a brief breathing space of time: if
they had gotten unto their power us their enemies who are
perpetually stinging them what would they not have done? and what
incurable mischief would they not have accomplished? For for this
reason God let them fall upon the herd of swine, in order that in
the case of the bodies of irrational animals thou mayest learn
their wickedness, and that they would have done to the possessed
the things which they did to the swine, had not the demoniacs in
their very madness experienced the providence of God, is evident to
all: and now therefore when thou seest a man excited by a Demon,
worship the Master. Learn the wickedness of the <pb n="184" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_184.html" id="x.iii-Page_184" />Demons. For it is possible to see
both things in the case of these Demons, the lovingkindness of God,
and the evil of the Demons. The evil of the Demons when they harass
and disturb the soul of the demented: and the lovingkindness of God
whenever he restrains and hinders so savage a Demon, who has taken
up his abode within, and desires to hurl the man headlong, and does
not allow him to use his own power to the full, but suffers him to
exhibit just so much strength, as both to bring the man to his
senses, and make his own wickedness apparent. Dost thou wish to
form another example to see once more how a Demon arranges matters
when God allows him to use his own power? Consider the herds, the
flocks of Job, how in one instant of time he annihilated all,
consider the pitiable death of the children, the blow that was
dealt to his body: and thou shalt see the savage and inhuman and
unsparing character of the wickedness of the Demons, and from these
things thou shalt know clearly that if God had entrusted the whole
of this world to their authority, they would have confused and
disturbed everything, and would have assigned to us their treatment
of the swine, and of those herds, since not even for a little
breathing space of time could they have endured to spare us our
salvation. If Demons were to arrange affairs, we should be in no
better condition than possessed men, yea rather we should be worse
than they. For God did not give them over entirely to the tyranny
of the Demons, otherwise they would suffer far worse things than
these which they now suffer. And I would ask this of those who say
these things, what kind of disorder they behold in the present,
that they set down all our affairs to the arrangement of Demons?
And yet we behold the sun for so many years proceeding day by day
in regular order, a manifold band of stars keeping their own order,
the courses of the moon unimpeded, an invariable succession of
night and day, all things, both above and below, as it were in a
certain fitting harmony, yea rather even far more, and more
accurately each keeping his own place, and not departing from the
order which God who made them ordained from the beginning.</p>

<p class="c10" id="x.iii-p38">7. And what is the use of all this, says one, when
the heaven indeed, and sun, and moon, and the band of stars, and
all the rest keep much good order, but our affairs are full of
confusion and disorder. What kind of confusion, O man, and
disorder? A certain one, says he, is rich, and overbearing, He is
rapacious and covetous, he drains the substance of the poor day by
day, and suffers no terrible affliction. Another lives in
forbearance, self-restraint, and uprightness, and is adorned with
all other good qualities, and is chastened with poverty and
disease, and extremely terrible afflictions. Are these then the
matters which offend thee? Yes, these, says he. If then thou seest
both of the rapacious, many chastened, and of those living
virtuously, yea some even enjoying countless goods, why dost thou
not abandon thine opinion, and be content with the Almighty?
Because it is this very thing which offends me more. For why when
there are two evil men, is one chastened, and another gets off, and
escapes; and when there are two good men, one is honoured, and the
other continues under punishment? And this very thing is a very
great work of God’s providence. For if he were to chasten all the
evil men, here; and were to honour here all the good men, a day of
judgment were superfluous. Again if he were to chasten no wicked
man, nor were to honour any of the good, then the base would become
baser and worse, as being more careless than the excellent, and
they who were minded to blaspheme would accuse God all the more,
and say that our affairs were altogether deprived of his
providence. For if when certain evil men are chastened, and certain
good men punished, they likewise say that human affairs are subject
to no providence; if even this did not happen what would they not
say? and what words would they not send forth? On this account some
of the wicked he chastens, and some he does not chasten and some of
the good he honours and some he does not honour. He does not
chasten all, in order that he may persuade thee, that there is a
Resurrection. But he chastens some in order that he may make the
more careless, through fear by means of the punishment of the
others, more in earnest. Again he honours certain of the good, in
order that he may lead on others by his honours to emulate their
virtue. But he does not honour all, in order that thou mayest learn
that there is another season for rendering to all their recompense.
For if indeed all were to receive their deserts here, they would
disbelieve the account of the Resurrection. But if no one were to
receive his desert here, the majority would become more careless.
On this account some he chastens, and others he does not chasten,
profiting both those who are chastened, and those who are not
chastened. For he separates their wickedness from those, and he
makes the others by their punishment, more self-restrained. And
this is manifest from what Christ himself said. For when they
announced to him that a tower had been brought to the ground, and
had buried certain men, he saith to them “What think ye? that
<pb n="185" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_185.html" id="x.iii-Page_185" />these men were sinners
only? I say to you nay, but if ye do not repent ye also shall
suffer the same thing.”<note place="end" n="568" id="x.iii-p38.1"><p class="endnote" id="x.iii-p39"> <scripRef passage="Luke xiii. 4" id="x.iii-p39.1" parsed="|Luke|13|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.13.4">Luke xiii.
4</scripRef>.</p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="x.iii-p40">Dost thou see how those perished on account of
their sin, and the rest did not escape on account of their
righteousness, but in order that they might become better by the
punishment of the others? Were not then the chastened unjustly
dealt with says one? For they could without being chastened
themselves become better by the punishment of others. But if He had
known that they would become better from penitence God would not
have chastened them. For if when he foresaw that many would profit
nothing from his longsuffering, he nevertheless bears with them,
with much tolerance, fulfilling his own part, and affording them an
opportunity of coming out of their own senselessness to their sober
senses one day; how could he deprive those who were about to become
better from the punishment of others, of the benefit of repentance?
So that they are in no way unjustly treated, both their evil being
cut off by their punishment, and their chastening is to be lighter
there, because they suffered here beforehand. Again, they who were
not chastened are in no way unjustly treated; for it was possible
for them, had they wished, to have used the longsuffering of God,
to accomplish a most excellent change, and wondering at his
tolerance, to have become ashamed at his exceeding forbearance, and
one day to have gone over to virtue, and to have gained their own
salvation by the punishment of others. But if they remain in
wickedness, God is not to blame, who on this account was
longsuffering, that he might recover them, but they are unworthy of
pardon, who did not rightly use the longsuffering of God: and it is
not only possible to use this argument as a reason why all the
wicked are not chastened here, but another also not less than this.
Of what kind then is this? That if God brought upon all, the
chastenings which their sins deserved, our race would have been
carried off, and would have failed to come down to posterity. And
in order that thou mayest learn that this is true, hear the prophet
saying “If Thou observedst iniquity O Lord, who shall stand?”<note place="end" n="569" id="x.iii-p40.1"><p class="endnote" id="x.iii-p41"> <scripRef passage="Ps. cxxix. 3" id="x.iii-p41.1" parsed="|Ps|29|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.29.3">Ps. cxxix.

seems good to thee to investigate this saying, leaving the accurate
enquiry into the life of each, alone: (For it is not possible even
to know all that has been accomplished by each man) let us bring
forward those sins which all, without contradiction, commit: and
from these it will be plain and manifest to us, that if we were
chastened for each of our sins, we should long ago have perished.

fire” saith He.<note place="end" n="570" id="x.iii-p41.2"><p class="endnote" id="x.iii-p42"> <scripRef passage="Matt. v. 22" id="x.iii-p42.1" parsed="|Matt|5|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.22">Matt. v.

then any one of us who has never sinned this sin? What then? ought

sin any one would find many guilty. When then these acknowledged
sins are such and so insufferable, and each of these of itself
brings upon us inevitable chastisement, if we were to reckon up the
secret sins committed by us, then we shall see especially that the
providence of God does not bring upon us punishment for each sin.
So that when thou seest anyone rapacious, covetous, and not
chastened, then do thou unfold thine own conscience; reckon up
thine own life, go over the sins which have been committed and thou
shalt learn rightly that in thine own case first, it is not
expedient to be chastened for each of thy sins: for on this account
the majority make reckless utterances, since they do not look on
their own case before that of others, but we all leaving our own
alone, examine that of the rest. But let us no longer do this, but
the reverse, and if thou seest any righteous man chastened,
remember Job: for if any one be righteous, he will not be more
righteous than that man, nor within a small distance of approaching
him. And if he suffer countless ills, he has not yet suffered so
much, as that man.</p>

<p class="c10" id="x.iii-p45">8. Taking this then into thy mind, cease
charging the master; learning that it is not by way of deserting
him does God let such an one suffer ill, but through desire to
crown him, and make him more distinguished. And if thou seest a
sinner punished, remember the paralytic who passed thirty eight
years on his bed. For that that man was delivered over then to that
disease through sin, hear Christ saying “Behold thou art made
whole; sin no more lest a worse thing happen to thee.”<note place="end" n="573" id="x.iii-p45.1"><p class="endnote" id="x.iii-p46"> <scripRef passage="John v. 5, 14" id="x.iii-p46.1" parsed="|John|5|5|0|0;|John|5|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.5.5 Bible:John.5.14">John v. 5,
14</scripRef>.</p></note> For either
when we are chastened, we pay the penalty of our sins, or else we
receive the occasion of crowning if, when we live in rectitude, we
suffer ill. So that whether we live in righteousness, or in sins,
chastening is a useful thing for us, sometimes making us more
distinguished, sometimes rendering us more self-controlled, and
lightening our punishment 
<pb n="186" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_186.html" id="x.iii-Page_186" />to come for us. For that it is possible
that one chastened here, and bearing it thankfully should
experience milder punishment there hear St. Paul saying “For this
reason many are weak and sickly, and some sleep. For if we judged
ourselves, we should not be judged. But when we are judged we are
corrected by the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the
world.”<note place="end" n="574" id="x.iii-p46.2"><p class="endnote" id="x.iii-p47"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. xi. 30-32" id="x.iii-p47.1" parsed="|1Cor|11|30|11|32" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.11.30-1Cor.11.32">1 Cor. xi.

these things therefore, Let us both moralize in this way on the
providence of God, and stop the mouths of the gainsayers. And if
any of the events which happen pass our understanding, let us not
from this consider that our affairs are not governed by providence,
but perceiving His providence in part, in things incomprehensible
let us yield to the unsearchableness of His wisdom. For if it is
not possible for one not conversant with it to understand a man’s
art, much rather is it impossible for the human understanding to
comprehend the infinity of the providence of God. “For his
judgments are unsearchable and his ways past finding out.”<note place="end" n="575" id="x.iii-p47.2"><p class="endnote" id="x.iii-p48"> <scripRef passage="Rom. xi. 33" id="x.iii-p48.1" parsed="|Rom|11|33|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.11.33">Rom. xi.
33</scripRef>.</p></note> But
nevertheless from small portions we gain a clear and manifest faith
about the whole, we give thanks to him for all that happens. For
there is even another consideration that cannot be contradicted,
for those who wish to moralize about the providence of God. For we
would ask the gainsayers, is there then a God? and if they should
say there is not, let us not answer them. For just as it is
worthless to answer madmen, so too those who say there is no God.
For if a ship having few sailors, and passengers, would not be
conducted safely for one mile even, without the hand which guides
it, much more, such a world as this, having so many persons in it,
composed of different elements, would not have continued so long a
time, were there not a certain providence presiding over it, both
governing, and continually maintaining this whole fabric, and if in
shame, through the common opinion of all men, and the experience of
affairs, they confess that there is a God, let us say this to them.
If there is a God, as indeed there is, it follows that He is just,
for if He is not just neither is He God, and if He is just He
recompenses to each according to their desert. But we do not see
all here receiving according to their desert. Therefore it is
necessary to hope for some other requital awaiting us, in order
that by each one receiving according to his desert, the justice of
God may be made manifest. For this consideration does not only
contribute to our wisdom about providence alone, but about the
Resurrection; and let us teach others, and let us do all diligence
to shut the mouths of them who rave against the master, and let us
ourselves glorify him in all things. For thus shall we win more of
his care, and enjoy much of his influence, and thus shall we be
able to escape from real evil, and obtain future good, through the
grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, By whom and with
whom be glory to the Father, with the Holy Spirit, now and always,
for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p class="c38" id="x.iv-p2">Against those who object because the devil has not
been put out of the world: and to prove that his wickedness does no
harm to us—if we take heed: and concerning repentance.</p>

<p class="c9" id="x.iv-p3">1. <span class="c12" id="x.iv-p3.1">When</span> Isaac, in old
time, was desirous to eat a meal at the hands of his son, he sent
his son forth from the house to the chace. But when this Isaac was
desirous to accept a meal at my hands he did not send me forth from
the house, but himself ran to our table. What could be more
tenderly affectionate than he? What more humble? who thought fit to
shew his warm love thus, and deigned to descend so far. On this
account surely, we also having spent the tones of our voice, and
the strength of our feet over the morning discourse, when we saw
his fatherly face, forgot our weakness, lay aside our fatigue, were
uplifted with pleasure; we saw his illustrious hoary head, and our
soul was filled with light. On this account too, we set out our
table with readiness, in order that he should eat and bless us.
There is no fraud and guile, here, as there was then, there. One
indeed was commanded to bring the meal—but another brought it.
But <i>I</i> was commanded to bring it, and brought it too. Bless
me then, O my father, with spiritual blessing, which we all also
pray ever to receive, and 
<pb n="187" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_187.html" id="x.iv-Page_187" />which is profitable not only to thee, but also to
me, and to all these. Entreat the common master of us all, to
prolong thy life to the old age of Isaac. For this is both for me,
and for these, more valuable, and more needful than the dew of
heaven, and the fatness of the earth.</p>

<p class="c10" id="x.iv-p4">But it is time to proceed to set out our
table; what then is this? The remains of what was lately said with
a view to our love of you. For still—still—we renew our
discourse concerning the Devil, which we started two days ago,
which we also addressed to the initiated, this morning when we
discoursed to them about renunciation, and covenant. And we do
this, not because our discourse about the Devil is sweet to us, but
because the doctrine about him is full of security for you. For he
is an enemy and a foe, and it is a great security to know clearly,
the tactics of your enemies. We have said lately, that he does not
overcome by force, nor by tyranny, nor through compulsion, nor
through violence. Since were this so, he would have destroyed all
men. And in testimony of this we brought forward the swine, against
which the Demons were unable to venture anything, before the
permission of the Master.<note place="end" n="576" id="x.iv-p4.1"><p class="endnote" id="x.iv-p5"> <scripRef passage="Matt. viii. 31" id="x.iv-p5.1" parsed="|Matt|8|31|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.8.31">Matt.
viii. 31</scripRef>.</p></note> The herds and flocks of Job. For
not even did the Devil venture to destroy these, until he received
power from above. We learned therefore this one thing first, that
he does not overcome us by force, or by compulsion; next after
that, we added that even when he overcomes by deceitfulness, not
thus does he get the better of all men, Then again we brought that
athlete Job, himself into the midst, against whom he set countless
schemes going, and not even thus got the better of him, but
withdrew defeated. One question still remains. What then is this
matter? That if he does not overcome says one, by force, yet by
deceitfulness. And on this account it were better that he should be
destroyed. For if Job got the better of him, yet Adam was deceived
and overthrown. Now if once for all he had been removed from the
world, Adam would never have been overthrown. But now he remains,
and is defeated indeed by one, but gets the better of many. Ten
overcame him, but he himself overcomes and wrestles down ten
thousand and if God took him away from the world, these ten
thousand would not have perished. What then shall we say to this?
That first of all they who overcame are more valuable far than they
who are defeated, even if the latter be more, and the former less.
“For better is one,” saith he “that doeth the will of God
than ten thousand transgressors.”<note place="end" n="577" id="x.iv-p5.2"><p class="endnote" id="x.iv-p6"> <scripRef passage="Ecclesiasticus 16.3" id="x.iv-p6.1" parsed="|Sir|16|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Sir.16.3">Ecclus. xvi. 3</scripRef>.</p></note> And next, that if the antagonist
were taken away he who overcomes is thereby injured. For if thou
lettest the adversary remain, the more slothful are injured, not on
account of the more diligent, but by their own slothfulness;
whereas if thou takest away the antagonist, the more diligent are
betrayed on account of the slothful, and neither exhibit their own
power, nor win crowns.</p>

<p class="c10" id="x.iv-p7">2. Perhaps ye have not yet understood what has been
said. Therefore it is necessary that I should say it again more
clearly. Let there be one antagonist. But let there be also two
athletes about to wrestle against him, and of these two athletes
let one be consumed with gluttony, unprepared, void of strength,
nerveless; but the other diligent, of good habit, passing his time
in the wrestling school, in many gymnastic exercises, and
exhibiting all the practice which bears upon the contest. If then
thou takest away the antagonist, which of these two hast thou
injured? The slothful, pray, and unprepared, or the earnest one who
has toiled so much? It is quite clear that it is the earnest one:
For the one indeed is wronged by the slothful, after the antagonist
has been taken away. But the slothful, while he remains, is no
longer injured on account of the earnest. For he has fallen, owing
to his own slothfulness.</p>

<p class="c10" id="x.iv-p8">I will state another solution of this
question, in order that thou mayest learn, that the Devil does not
injure, but their own slothfulness everywhere overthrows those who
do not take heed. Let the Devil be allowed to be exceeding wicked,
not by nature, but by choice and conviction. For that the Devil is
not by nature wicked, learn from his very names. For the Devil, the
slanderer that is, is called so from slandering; for he slandered
man to God saying “Doth Job reverence thee for nought? but put
out thine hand, and touch what he hath, see if he will not
blaspheme thee to thy face.”<note place="end" n="578" id="x.iv-p8.1"><p class="endnote" id="x.iv-p9"> <scripRef passage="Job i. 9, 11" id="x.iv-p9.1" parsed="|Job|1|9|0|0;|Job|1|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Job.1.9 Bible:Job.1.11">Job i. 9,
11</scripRef>.</p></note> He slandered God again to man
saying “Fire fell from heaven and burnt up the sheep.”<note place="end" n="579" id="x.iv-p9.2"><p class="endnote" id="x.iv-p10"> <scripRef passage="Job i. 16" id="x.iv-p10.1" parsed="|Job|1|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Job.1.16">Job i.
16</scripRef>.</p></note> For he was
anxious to persuade him, that this warfare was stirred up from
above, out of the heavens, and he set the servant at variance with
the master, and the master with his servant; rather he did not set
them at variance, but attempted to indeed, but was not able, in
order that whenever thou mayest set another servant at variance
with his master, Adam with God, and believing the Devil’s
slander, thou mayest learn that he gained strength, not owing to
his own power but from that man’s slothfulness and carelessness.
He is called the Devil therefore on that 
<pb n="188" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_188.html" id="x.iv-Page_188" />account. But to slander, and to refrain from
slander is not natural, but an action which takes place and which
ceases to take place, occurring and ceasing to occur. Now such
things do not reach the rank of the nature or of the essence of a
thing. I know that this consideration about essence and accident is
hard to be grasped by many. But there are they who are able to lend
a finer ear, wherefore also we have spoken these things. Do you
wish that I should come to another name? You shall see that that
also is not a name which belongs to his essence or nature. He is
called wicked. But his wickedness is not from his nature, but from
his choice. For even this at one time is present, at another time
is absent. Do not thou then say this to me that it always remains
with him. For it was not indeed with him at the beginning, but
afterwards came upon him; wherefore he is called apostate. Although
many men are wicked, he alone is called wicked by pre-eminence. Why
then is he thus called? Because though in no way wronged by us,
having no grudge whether small or great, when he saw mankind had in
honour, he straightway envied him his good. What therefore could be
worse than this wickedness, except when hatred and war exist,
without having any reasonable cause. Let the Devil then be let
alone, and let us bring forward the creation, in order that thou
mayest learn that the Devil is not the cause of ills to us, if we
would only take heed: in order that thou mayest learn that the weak
in choice, and the unprepared, and slothful, even were there no
Devil, falls, and casts himself into many a depth of evil. The
Devil is evil. I know it myself and it is acknowledged by all, yet
give heed strictly to the things which are now about to be said.
For they are not ordinary matters, but those about which many
words, many times, and in many places arise, about which there is
many a fight and battle not only on the part of the faithful
against unbelievers but also on the part of the faithful against
the faithful. For this is that which is full of pain.</p>

<p class="c10" id="x.iv-p11">3. The Devil then is acknowledged, as I said,
to be evil by all. What shall we say about this beautiful and
wondrous creation? Pray is the creation too, wicked? and who is so
corrupt, who so dull, and demented as to accuse the creation? what
then shall we say about this? For it is not wicked, but is both
beautiful and a token of the wisdom and power and lovingkindness of
God. Hear at least how the prophet marvels at it, saying, “How
are thy works magnified O Lord! in wisdom Thou hast made them
all.”<note place="end" n="580" id="x.iv-p11.1"><p class="endnote" id="x.iv-p12"> <scripRef passage="Ps. civ. 24" id="x.iv-p12.1" parsed="|Ps|4|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.4.24">Ps. civ.

through them one by one, but withdrew before the incomprehensible
wisdom of God. And that he has made it thus beautiful and vast hear

Paul saying, “For the invisible things of Him, since the creation

these by which he spake declared that the creation leads us to the
knowledge of God, because it causes us to know the Master fully.
What then? If we see this beautiful and wondrous creation itself
becoming a cause of impiety to many, shall we blame it? In no wise,
but them who were unable to use the medicine rightly. Whence then
is this which leads us to the knowledge of God, a cause of impiety?
“The wise” saith he “were darkened in their understandings,
and worshipped and served the creature more than the creator.”<note place="end" n="583" id="x.iv-p14.2"><p class="endnote" id="x.iv-p15"> <scripRef passage="Rom. i. 21, 25" id="x.iv-p15.1" parsed="|Rom|1|21|0|0;|Rom|1|25|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.1.21 Bible:Rom.1.25">Rom. i.

nowhere here, a Demon is nowhere here, but the creation alone is
set before us, as the teacher of the knowledge of God. How then has
it become the cause of impiety? Not owing to its own nature, but
owing to the carelessness of those who do not take heed. What then?
Shall we take away even the creation? tell me.</p>

<p class="c10" id="x.iv-p16">And why do I speak about the creation? Let us come
to our own members. For even these we shall find to be a cause of
destruction if we do not take heed, not because of their own
nature, but because of our sloth. And look; an eye was given, in
order that thou mayest behold the creation and glorify the Master.
But if thou dost not use the eye well, it becomes to thee the
minister of adultery. A tongue has been given, in order that thou
mayest speak well, in order that thou mayest praise the Creator.
But if thou givest not excellent heed, it becomes a cause of
blasphemy to thee. And hands were given thee that thou mayest
stretch them forth unto prayer. But if thou are not wary, thou
stretchest them out unto covetousness. Feet were given in order
that thou mayest run unto good works, but if thou art careless thou
wilt cause wicked works by means of them: Dost thou see that all
things hurt the weak man? Dost thou see that even the medicines of
salvation inflict death upon the weak, not because of their own
nature but because of his weakness? God made the heaven in order
that thou mayest wonder at the work, and worship the master. But
others leaving the creator alone, have worshipped the heaven; and
this from their own carelessness and senselessness. But <pb n="189" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_189.html" id="x.iv-Page_189" />why do I speak of the creation?
assuredly what could be more conducive to salvation than the Cross?
But this Cross has become an offence to the weak. “For the word
of the Cross is to them that are perishing, foolishness: but to
those which are being saved, it is the power of God.”<note place="end" n="584" id="x.iv-p16.1"><p class="endnote" id="x.iv-p17"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. i. 18" id="x.iv-p17.1" parsed="|1Cor|1|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.1.18">1 Cor. i.

than Paul, and the apostles? But the Apostles became a savour of
death to many. He says at least “to one a savour from death unto
death: to the other a savour from life unto life.”<note place="end" n="586" id="x.iv-p18.2"><p class="endnote" id="x.iv-p19"> <scripRef passage="2 Cor. ii. 16" id="x.iv-p19.1" parsed="|2Cor|2|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.2.16">2 Cor. ii.

see that the weak is hurt even by Paul, but the strong is injured
not even by the Devil?</p>

<p class="c10" id="x.iv-p20">4. Dost thou wish that we should exercise the
argument in the case of Jesus Christ? What is equal to that
salvation? what more profitable than that presence? But this very
saving presence, so profitable, became an additional means of
chastening to many. “For for judgment” saith he “came I into
this world, that they which see not may see, and that they which
see may become blind.”<note place="end" n="587" id="x.iv-p20.1"><p class="endnote" id="x.iv-p21"> <scripRef passage="John ix. 39" id="x.iv-p21.1" parsed="|John|9|39|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.9.39">John ix.
39</scripRef>.</p></note> What dost thou say? The light
became a cause of blindness? The light did not become a cause of
blindness, but the weakness of the eyes of the soul was not able to
entertain the light. Thou hast seen that a weak man is hurt on all
sides, but the strong is benefited on all sides. For in every case,
the purpose is the cause, in every case the disposition is master.
Since the Devil, if thou wouldest understand it, is even profitable
to us, if we use him aright, and benefits us greatly, and we gain
no ordinary advantages; and this, we shewed in a small degree from
the case of Job. And it is possible also to learn this from Paul:
for writing about the fornicator he thus speaks “Deliver such an
one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit
may be saved.”<note place="end" n="588" id="x.iv-p21.2"><p class="endnote" id="x.iv-p22"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. v. 5" id="x.iv-p22.1" parsed="|1Cor|5|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.5.5">1 Cor. v.
5</scripRef>.</p></note> Behold even
the Devil has become a cause of salvation, but not because of his
own disposition, but because of the skill of the Apostle. For as
the physicians taking serpents and cutting off their destructive
members, prepare medicines for antidotes; so also did Paul. He took
whatever was profitable of the chastening that proceeds from the
Devil, and left the rest alone; in order that thou mayest learn
that the Devil is not the cause of salvation, but that he hasted to
destroy and devour mankind. But that the Apostle through his own
wisdom cut his throat: hear in the second epistle to the
Corinthians, what he saith about this very fornicator, “confirm
your love towards him,” “lest by any means such an one should
be swallowed up by over much sorrow.” And, “we be taken
advantage of by Satan.”<note place="end" n="589" id="x.iv-p22.2"><p class="endnote" id="x.iv-p23"> <scripRef passage="2 Cor. ii. 8, 7, 11" id="x.iv-p23.1" parsed="|2Cor|2|8|0|0;|2Cor|2|7|0|0;|2Cor|2|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.2.8 Bible:2Cor.2.7 Bible:2Cor.2.11">2 Cor. ii.
8, 7, 11</scripRef>.</p></note> We have snatched beforehand the man
from the gullet of the wild beast, he saith. For the Apostle often
used the Devil as an executioner. For the executioners punish those
who have done wrong, not as they choose, but as the judges allow.
For this is the rule for the executioner, to take vengeance, giving
heed to the command of the judge. Dost thou see to what a dignity
the Apostle mounted? He who was invested with a body, used the
bodiless as an executioner; and that which their common master
saith to the Devil, concerning Job: charging him thus, “Touch his
flesh, but thou shalt not touch his life;”<note place="end" n="590" id="x.iv-p23.2"><p class="endnote" id="x.iv-p24"> <scripRef passage="Job ii. 5, 6" id="x.iv-p24.1" parsed="|Job|2|5|2|6" osisRef="Bible:Job.2.5-Job.2.6">Job ii. 5,
6</scripRef>.</p></note> giving him a limit, and measure of
vengeance, in order that the wild beast might not be impetuous and
leap upon him too shamelessly; this too the Apostle does. For
delivering the fornicator over to him he says “For the
destruction of the flesh,”<note place="end" n="591" id="x.iv-p24.2"><p class="endnote" id="x.iv-p25"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. v. 5" id="x.iv-p25.1" parsed="|1Cor|5|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.5.5">1 Cor. v.
5</scripRef>.</p></note> that is “thou shalt not touch his
life.” Dost thou see the authority of the servant? Fear not
therefore the Devil, even if he be bodiless: for he has come in
contact with him. And nothing is weaker than he who has come into
such contact even though he be not invested with a body, as then
nothing is stronger than he who has boldness even though he bear
about a mortal body.</p>

<p class="c10" id="x.iv-p26">5. All these things have been now said by me, not in
order that I may discharge the Devil from blame, but that I may
free you from slothfulness. For he wishes extremely to attribute
the cause of our sins to himself, in order that we being nourished
by these hopes, and entering on all kinds of evil, may increase the
chastening in our own case, and may meet with no pardon from having
transferred the cause to him. Just as Eve met with none. But let us
not do this. But let us know ourselves. Let us know our wounds. For
thus shall we be able to apply the medicines. For he who does not
know his disease, will give no care to his weakness. We have sinned
much: I know this well. For we are all liable for penalties. But we
are not deprived of pardon; nor shall we fall away from repentance
for we still stand in the arena, and are in the struggles of
repentance. Art thou old, and hast thou come to the last outlet of
life? Do not consider even thus that thou hast fallen from
repentance, nor despair of thine own salvation, but consider the
robber who was freed on the cross. For what was briefer than that
hour in which he was crowned? Yet notwithstanding even this was
enough for him, for salvation. Art 
<pb n="190" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_190.html" id="x.iv-Page_190" />thou young? Do not be confident in thy
youth, nor think that thou hast a very fixed term of life, “For
the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.”<note place="end" n="592" id="x.iv-p26.1"><p class="endnote" id="x.iv-p27"> <scripRef passage="1 Thess. v. 2" id="x.iv-p27.1" parsed="|1Thess|5|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Thess.5.2">1 Thess.

account he has made our end invisible, in order that we might make
our diligence and our forethought plain. Dost thou not see men
taken away prematurely day after day? On this account a certain one
admonishes “make no tarrying to turn to the Lord and put not off
from day to day,”<note place="end" n="593" id="x.iv-p27.2"><p class="endnote" id="x.iv-p28"> <scripRef passage="Ecclesiasticus 5.8" id="x.iv-p28.1" parsed="|Sir|5|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Sir.5.8">Ecclus. v. 8</scripRef>.</p></note> lest at any time, as thou delayest,
thou art destroyed. Let the old man keep this admonition, let the
young man take this advice. Yea, art thou in security, and art thou
rich, and dost thou abound in wealth, and does no affliction happen
to thee? Still hear what Paul says “when they say peace and
safety, then sudden destruction cometh upon them.”<note place="end" n="594" id="x.iv-p28.2"><p class="endnote" id="x.iv-p29"> <scripRef passage="1 Thess. v. 3" id="x.iv-p29.1" parsed="|1Thess|5|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Thess.5.3">1 Thess.

full of much change. We are not masters of our end. Let us be
masters of virtue. Our Master Christ is loving.</p>

<p class="c10" id="x.iv-p30">6. Do you wish that I shall speak of the ways
of repentance? They are many, and various, and different, and all
lead to heaven. The first way of repentance is condemnation of
sins. “Declare thou first thy sins that thou mayest be
justified.”<note place="end" n="595" id="x.iv-p30.1"><p class="endnote" id="x.iv-p31"> <scripRef passage="Isa. xliii. 26" id="x.iv-p31.1" parsed="|Isa|43|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.43.26">Isa.
xliii. 26</scripRef>.</p></note> Wherefore
also the prophet said “I said, I will speak out, my transgression
to the Lord, and thou remittedst the iniquity of my heart.”<note place="end" n="596" id="x.iv-p31.2"><p class="endnote" id="x.iv-p32"> <scripRef passage="Ps. xxxii. 5" id="x.iv-p32.1" parsed="|Ps|32|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.32.5">Ps. xxxii.
5</scripRef>.</p></note> Condemn
thyself therefore for thy sins. This is enough for the Master by
way of self-defence. For he who condemns his sins, is slower to
fall into them again. Awake thy conscience, that inward accuser, in
order that thou mayest have no accuser at the judgment seat of the
Lord. This is one way of repentance, the best; and there is another
not less than this, not to bear a grudge against thine enemies to
overcome anger, to forgive the sins of our fellow-servants. For so
will those which have been done against the master be forgiven us.
See the second expiation of sins: “For if ye forgive” saith he,
“your debtors, your Heavenly Father will also forgive you.”<note place="end" n="597" id="x.iv-p32.2"><p class="endnote" id="x.iv-p33"> <scripRef passage="Matt. vi. 14" id="x.iv-p33.1" parsed="|Matt|6|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.6.14">Matt. vi.
14</scripRef>.</p></note> Dost thou
wish to learn a third way of repentance? Fervent and diligent
prayer, and to do this from the bottom of the heart. Hast thou not
seen that widow, how she persuaded the shameless judge?<note place="end" n="598" id="x.iv-p33.2"><p class="endnote" id="x.iv-p34"> <scripRef passage="Luke xviii. 3" id="x.iv-p34.1" parsed="|Luke|18|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.18.3">Luke
xviii. 3</scripRef>.</p></note> But thou
hast a gentle Master, both tender, and kind. She asked, against her
adversaries, but thou dost not ask against thine adversaries, but
on behalf of thine own salvation. And if thou wouldest learn a
fourth way, I will say almsgiving. For this has a great power and
unspeakable. For Daniel saith to Nebuchadnezzar when he had come to
all kinds of evil, and had entered upon all impiety, “O King let
my counsel be acceptable unto thee, redeem thy sins by almsgiving
and thine iniquities by compassion on the poor.”<note place="end" n="599" id="x.iv-p34.2"><p class="endnote" id="x.iv-p35"> <scripRef passage="Dan. iv. 27" id="x.iv-p35.1" parsed="|Dan|4|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Dan.4.27">Dan. iv.
27</scripRef>.</p></note> What could
be compared with this lovingkindness? After countless sins, after
so many transgressions, he is promised that he will be reconciled
with him he has come into conflict with if he will show kindness to
his own fellow-servants. And modesty, and humility, not less than
all words spoken, exhaust the nature of sins. And the publican is
proof, being unable to declare his good deeds, in sight of all,
bringing forward his humility, and laying aside the heavy burden of
his sins.<note place="end" n="600" id="x.iv-p35.2"><p class="endnote" id="x.iv-p36"> <scripRef passage="Luke xviii. 13" id="x.iv-p36.1" parsed="|Luke|18|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.18.13">Luke
xviii. 13</scripRef>.</p></note> See we have
shewn five ways of repentance: first the condemnation of sins, next
the forgiveness of our neighbours’ sins, thirdly that which comes
of prayer, fourth that which comes of almsgiving, fifth that which
comes of humility. Do not thou then be lazy; but walk in all these
day by day. For the ways are easy, nor canst thou plead poverty.
And even if thou livest poorer than all, thou art able to leave
thine anger, and be humble, and to pray fervently, and to condemn
sins, and thy poverty is in no way a hindrance. And why do I speak
thus, when not even in that way of repentance in which it is
possible to spend money (I speak of almsgiving), not even there is
poverty any hindrance to us from obeying the command? The widow who
spent the two mites is a proof.<note place="end" n="601" id="x.iv-p36.2"><p class="endnote" id="x.iv-p37"> <scripRef passage="Mark xii. 42" id="x.iv-p37.1" parsed="|Mark|12|42|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Mark.12.42">Mark xii.
42</scripRef>.</p></note> Having learned then the healing of
our wounds, let us constantly apply these medicines, in order that
we may return to health and enjoy the sacred table with assurance;
and with much glory, reach Christ the king of glory, and attain to
everlasting good by the grace, and compassion, and lovingkindness
of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom and with whom be glory, power,
honour, to the Father, together with the all holy, and good and
quickening Spirit, now and always and for ever and ever.
Amen.</p>

III.</span></p>

<p class="c38" id="x.v-p2">That evil comes of sloth, and virtue from diligence,
and that neither wicked men, nor the devil himself, are able to do
the wary man any harm. The proof of this from many passages, and
amongst others from those which relate to Adam and to Job.</p>

<p class="c9" id="x.v-p3">1. <span class="c12" id="x.v-p3.1">The</span> day before
yesterday we set on foot our sermon concerning the Devil, out of
our love for you. But others, the day before yesterday while these
matters were being set on foot here, took their places in the
theatre, and were looking on at the Devil’s show. They were
taking part in lascivious songs; ye were having a share in
spiritual music. They were eating of the Devil’s garbage: ye were
feeding on spiritual unguents. Who pray decoyed them? Who pray
separated them from the sacred flock? Did the Devil pray deceive
them? How did he not deceive you? you and they are men alike; I
mean as regards your nature. You and they have the same soul, you
have the same desires, so far as nature is concerned. How is it
then that you and they were not in the same place? Because you and
they have not the same purpose. On this account they indeed are
under deception, but you beyond deception. I do not say these
things again as discharging the Devil from accusation, but as
desiring earnestly to free you from sins. The Devil is wicked; I
grant this indeed, but he is wicked for himself not towards us if
we are wary. For the nature of wickedness is of this kind. It is
destructive to those alone who hold to it. Virtue is the contrary.
It is not only able to profit those who hold to it, but those
nearest at hand too. And in order that thou mayest learn that evil
is evil in itself, but good is also good to others, I provide thee
with proverbial evidence: “My son” saith he “if thou art
become evil, thou shall bear thine evils alone, but if wise, for
thyself and thy neighbour.”<note place="end" n="602" id="x.v-p3.2"><p class="endnote" id="x.v-p4"> <scripRef passage="Prov. ix. 12" id="x.v-p4.1" parsed="|Prov|9|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Prov.9.12">Prov. ix.
12</scripRef>.</p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="x.v-p5">They were deceived in the theatre, but ye were
not deceived. This is the greatest proof of things, a clear
testimony, and unquestionable reasoning, that in every case, the
purpose is master. Do thou accordingly use this method of proof,
and if thou seest a man living in wickedness, and exhibiting all
kinds of evil; then blaming the providence of God, and saying that
by the necessity of fortune and fate and through tyranny of Demons
He gave us our nature, and on all sides shifting the cause from
himself indeed, and transferring it to the creator who provides for
all; silence his speech not by word, but by deed, shewing him
another fellow servant living in virtue and forbearance. There is
no need of long speeches, no need of a complex plan, nor even of
syllogisms. By means of deeds the proof is brought about. He said
to him: thou art a servant, and he is a servant; thou art a man and
he is a man. Thou livest in the same world: thou art nourished with
the same nourishment under the same heaven: How is it that thou art
living in wickedness, he in virtue? on this account God allowed the
wicked to be mingled with the good; and did not give one law to the
wicked indeed, and appointed another world as a colony for the
good, but mixed these and those; conferring great benefit. For the
good appear more thoroughly approved when they are in the midst of
those who try to hinder them from living rightly, and who entice
them to evil, and yet keep hold of virtue. “For there must” he
saith “be also heresies among you that they which are approved
may be made manifest among you.” <note place="end" n="603" id="x.v-p5.1"><p class="endnote" id="x.v-p6"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. xi. 19" id="x.v-p6.1" parsed="|1Cor|11|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.11.19">1 Cor. xi.
19</scripRef>.</p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="x.v-p7">Therefore also on this account he has left the
wicked to be in the world, in order that the good may shine the
brighter. Dost thou see how great is the gain? But the gain is not
owing to the wicked, but owing to the courage of the good. On this
account also we admire Noe, not because he was righteous nor yet
because he was perfect alone, but because in that perverse and
wicked generation he preserved his virtue, when he had no pattern
of virtue, when all men invited him to wickedness; and he went his
whole way contrary to them, like some traveller, pursuing his way
while the great multitude is being borne along vehemently. On this
account he did not simply say “Noe was just, perfect,” but
added “in his generation”<note place="end" n="604" id="x.v-p7.1"><p class="endnote" id="x.v-p8"> <scripRef passage="Gen. vi. 9" id="x.v-p8.1" parsed="|Gen|6|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.6.9">Gen. vi.
9</scripRef>.</p></note> in that perverse, that desperate
generation, when there was no acquisition of virtue. To the good
indeed then this was the gain from the wicked. Thus at all events,
also trees tossed about by contrary winds, become stronger. And
there is a gain to the wicked from their mixing with the good. They
feel confusion, they are ashamed, they 
<pb n="192" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_192.html" id="x.v-Page_192" />blush in their presence; and even if they
do not abstain from evil, yet nevertheless they dare what they dare
with secrecy. And this is no small thing not to have transgression
publicly committed. For the life of the others becomes the accuser
of the wickedness of these. Hear at least what they say about the
righteous man. “He is grievous to us, even when beheld,”<note place="end" n="605" id="x.v-p8.2"><p class="endnote" id="x.v-p9"> <scripRef passage="Wisd. ii. 15" id="x.v-p9.1" parsed="|Wis|2|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Wis.2.15">Wisd. ii.
15</scripRef>.</p></note> and it is no
small beginning of amendment to be tormented at his presence. For
if the sight of the righteous man did not torment them, this word
would not have been uttered. But to be stung, and pinched in
conscience at his presence, would be no little hindrance to
indulging in wickedness with pleasure, Dost thou see how great is
the gain both to the good from the wicked, and to the wicked from
the good? On this account God has not set them apart, but allowed
them to be mingled together.</p>

<p class="c10" id="x.v-p10">2. Let our argument also about the Devil be
the same. For on this account He hath left him also to be here, in
order that he might render thee the stronger, in order that he may
make the athlete more illustrious, in order that the contests may
be greater. When therefore any one says, why has God left the Devil
here? say these words to him, because he not only does no harm to
the wary and the heedful, but even profits them, not owing to his
own purpose (for that is wicked), but owing to their courage who
have used that wickedness aright. Since he even fixed upon Job not
on this account that he might make him more illustrious, but in
order that he might upset him. On this account he is wicked both
because of such an opinion and such a purpose. But notwithstanding
he did no harm to the righteous man, but he rather rejoiced in the
conflict as we accordingly shewed. Both the Demon shewed his
wickedness and the righteous man his courage. But he does upset
many says one: owing to their weakness, not owing to his own
strength: for this too has been already proved by many examples.
Direct thine own intention aright then, and thou shalt never
receive harm from any, but shall get the greatest gain, not only
from the good but even from the wicked. For on this account, as I
have before said, God has suffered men to be with one another, and
especially the wicked with the good, in order that they may bring
them over to their own virtue. Hear at least what Christ saith to
his disciples, “The Kingdom of heaven is like unto a woman who
took leaven and hid it in three measures of meal.”<note place="end" n="606" id="x.v-p10.1"><p class="endnote" id="x.v-p11"> <scripRef passage="Matt. xiii. 33" id="x.v-p11.1" parsed="|Matt|13|33|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.13.33">Matt.
xiii. 33</scripRef>.</p></note> So that the
righteous have the power of leaven, in order that they may transfer
the wicked to their own manner of conduct. But the righteous are
few, for the leaven is small. But the smallness in no way injures
the lump, but that little quantity converts the whole of the meal
to itself by means of the power inherent in it. So accordingly the
power also of the righteous has its force not in the magnitude of
their number, but in the grace of the Spirit. There were twelve
Apostles. Dost thou see how little is the leaven? The whole world
was in unbelief. Dost thou see how great is the lump? But those
twelve turned the whole world to themselves. The leaven and the
lump had the same nature but not the same manner of conduct. On
this account he left the wicked in the midst of the good, that
since they are of the same nature as the righteous they may also
become of the same purpose.</p>

<p class="c10" id="x.v-p12">Remember these things. With these stop the
mouths of the indolent, the dissolute, the slothful, the indisposed
towards the labours of virtue, those who accuse their common
Master. “Thou hast sinned” he saith “be still.”<note place="end" n="607" id="x.v-p12.1"><p class="endnote" id="x.v-p13"> <scripRef passage="Gen. iv. 7" id="x.v-p13.1" parsed="|Gen|4|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.4.7">Gen. iv.

add a second more grievous sin.”<note place="end" n="608" id="x.v-p13.2"><p class="endnote" id="x.v-p14"> <scripRef passage="Ecclesiasticus 21.1" id="x.v-p14.1" parsed="|Sir|21|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Sir.21.1">Ecclus. xxi. 1</scripRef>.</p></note> It is not so grievous to sin, as
after the sin to accuse the Master. Take knowledge of the cause of
the sin, and thou wilt find that it is none other than thyself who
hast sinned. Everywhere there is a need of a good intention. I have
shewn you this not from simple reasoning only, but from the case of
fellow-servants living in the world itself. Do thou also use this
proof. Thus too our common master will judge us. Learn this method
of proof, and no one will be able to reason with you. Is any a
fornicator? Shew him another who is self-restrained. Is any
covetous and rapacious? Shew him one who gives alms. Does he live
in jealousy and envy? Shew him one clean from passion. Is he
overcome by anger? Bring into the midst one who is living in
wisdom, for we must not only have recourse to ancient example, but
take our models from present times. For even to-day by the grace of
God, good deeds are done not less than of old. Is a man
incredulous? and does he think that the scriptures are false? Does
he not believe that Job was such as he was? Shew him another man,
emulating the life of that righteous person. Thus will the Master
also judge us: He places fellow servants with fellow-servants, nor
does he give sentence according to his own judgment, in order that
no one may begin to say again, as that servant said, who was
entrusted with the talent, and who instead of a talent brought the
accusation. “Thou art an austere man.”<note place="end" n="609" id="x.v-p14.2"><p class="endnote" id="x.v-p15"> <scripRef passage="Matt. xxv. 24" id="x.v-p15.1" parsed="|Matt|25|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.25.24">Matt. xxv.

<pb n="193" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_193.html" id="x.v-Page_193" />ought to mourn, because he did not double the
talent, but rendered his sin the more grievous, by adding to his
own idleness, his accusation against the Master. For what saith he?
“I knew thee that thou art an austere man.” O miserable, and
wretched, ungrateful and lazy man! Thou oughtest to have accused
thine own idleness, and to have taken away somewhat from thy former
sin. But thou in bringing an account against the master hast
doubled thy sin instead of doubling thy talent.</p>

<p class="c10" id="x.v-p16">3. On this account God places together
servants and servants in order that the one set may judge the
other, and that some being judged by the others may not be able for
the future to accuse the master. On this account, he saith “The
Son of Man cometh in the glory of his Father.”<note place="end" n="610" id="x.v-p16.1"><p class="endnote" id="x.v-p17"> <scripRef passage="Matt. xvi. 27" id="x.v-p17.1" parsed="|Matt|16|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.16.27">Matt. xvi.

does not say in glory like to the glory of the Father, but in the
glory of the Father, and will gather together all the nations.
Terrible is the tribunal: terrible to the sinful, and the
accountable. Since to those who are conscious to themselves of good
works, it is desirable and mild. “And he will place the sheep on
his right hand, and the kids on his left.”<note place="end" n="611" id="x.v-p17.2"><p class="endnote" id="x.v-p18"> <scripRef passage="Matt. xxv. 33" id="x.v-p18.1" parsed="|Matt|25|33|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.25.33">Matt. xxv.
33</scripRef>.</p></note> Both these and those are men. For
what reason then are those indeed sheep but these kids? Not that
thou mayest learn a difference in their nature, but the difference
in their purpose. But for what reason are they who did not show
compassion kids? Because that animal is unfruitful and is not able
to contribute services, either by its milk, or by progeny, or by
its hair, to those who possess it, being on all sides destitute of
such a contribution as this, on account of the immaturity of its
age. On this account he has called those who bear no fruit, by
comparison, kids, but those on the right hand sheep. For from these
the offering is great, both of their natural wool, their progeny,
and their milk. What then does he say to them? “Ye saw me
hungering and ye fed me, naked and ye clothed me, a stranger and ye
took me in.” Again to those he says the contrary. And yet both
these and those were alike men, both these and those received the
same promises, the same rewards were assigned to both on doing
right. The same person came both to these and to those, with the
same nakedness: and to these and to those with the same hunger, and
in the same way and a stranger. All things were alike to those and
to these.</p>

<p class="c10" id="x.v-p19">How then was the end not the same? Because the
purpose did not permit it. For this alone made the difference. On
this account the one set went to Gehenna, but the other to the
Kingdom. But if the Devil were the cause to them of their sins,
these would not be destined to be chastened, when another sinned
and drove them on. Dost thou see here both those who sin, and those
who do good works? Dost thou see how on seeing their
fellow-servants they were silenced? Come and let us bring our
discourse to another example for thy benefit. There were ten
virgins he says.<note place="end" n="612" id="x.v-p19.1"><p class="endnote" id="x.v-p20"> <scripRef passage="Matt. xxv" id="x.v-p20.1" parsed="|Matt|25|0|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.25">Matt.
xxv</scripRef>.</p></note> Here again
there are purposes which are upright, and purposes which are
sinful, in order thou mayest see side by side, both the sins of the
one and the good works of the others. For the comparison makes
these things the plainer. And these and those were virgins; and
these were five, and also those. All awaited the bridegroom. How
then did some enter in, and others did not enter in? Because some
indeed were churlish, and others were gentle and loving. Dost thou
see again that the purpose determined the nature of the end, not
the Devil? Dost thou see that the judgments were parallel, and that
the verdict given proceeds from those who are like each other?
Fellow-servants will judge fellow-servants. Dost thou wish that I
should shew thee a comparison arising from contrasts? for there is
one also from contrasts so that the condemnation may become the
greater. “The men of Nineveh” he saith “shall rise up, and
shall condemn this generation.”<note place="end" n="613" id="x.v-p20.2"><p class="endnote" id="x.v-p21"> <scripRef passage="Matt. xii. 41" id="x.v-p21.1" parsed="|Matt|12|41|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.12.41">Matt. xii.
41</scripRef>.</p></note> The judged are no longer alike, for
the one are barbarians, the others are Jews. The one enjoyed
prophetic teaching, the others were never partakers of a divine
instruction. And this is not the only difference, but the fact that
in that case a servant went to them, in this the master; and that
man came and proclaimed an overthrow; but this man declared the
glad tidings of a kingdom of heaven. Which of these was it the more
likely, would believe? The barbarians, and ignorant, and they who
had never partaken of divine teaching, or they who had from their
earliest age been trained in prophetic books? To every one, it is
plain, that the Jews would be more likely to believe. But the
contrary took place. And these disbelieved the Master when he
preached a kingdom of heaven, but those believed their
fellow-servant when he threatened an overthrow: in order that their
goodness, and these men’s folly might be manifested to a greater
degree. Is there a Demon? a Devil? chance? or Fate? has not each
become the cause to himself both of evil, and of virtue? For if
they themselves were not to be liable to account, he would not have
said that they shall judge this generation. Nor would he have said
that the Queen of the 
<pb n="194" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_194.html" id="x.v-Page_194" />South would condemn the Jews. For then
indeed not only will one people condemn another people, but one man
will often judge a whole people, when they who, it is allowed,
might readily have been deceived, are found to remain undeceived,
and they who ought in every way to have the advantage, turn out to
be worsted. On this account, we made mention of Adam and of Job,
for there is necessity to revert to that subject, so as to put the
finish to our discourse. He attacked Adam indeed by means of mere
words, but Job by means of deeds. For the one he denuded of all his
wealth, and deprived of his children. But from this man he took not
away anything, great or little of his possessions. But let us
rather examine the very words and the method of the plot. “The
serpent came” saith he “and said to the woman, What is it that
God hath said, ye shall not eat of every tree which is in the
garden?”<note place="end" n="614" id="x.v-p21.2"><p class="endnote" id="x.v-p22"> <scripRef passage="Gen. iii. 1" id="x.v-p22.1" parsed="|Gen|3|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.3.1">Gen. iii.
1</scripRef>.</p></note> Here it is a
serpent; there a woman, in the case of Job: mean while great is the
difference between the counsellors. The one<note place="end" n="615" id="x.v-p22.2"><p class="endnote" id="x.v-p23"> <i>i.e</i>., the Devil.</p></note> is a servant, the other<note place="end" n="616" id="x.v-p23.1"><p class="endnote" id="x.v-p24"><i>i.e</i>., Job’s wife.</p></note> a partner of
the man’s life. She is a helpmate, but the other is under
subjection. Dost thou see how unpardonable this is? Eve indeed, the
servant in subjection deceived: but him<note place="end" n="617" id="x.v-p24.1"><p class="endnote" id="x.v-p25"> <i>i.e</i>., Job.</p></note> not even his partner, and helpmate
could overthrow. But let us see what he saith. “What is this that
God hath said, thou shalt not eat of every tree?” Assuredly
indeed God did not say this but the opposite. See the villany of
the Devil. He said that which was not spoken, in order that he
might learn what was spoken. What then did the woman? She ought to
have silenced him, she ought not to have exchanged a word with him.
In foolishness she declared the judgment of the Master. Thereby she
afforded the Devil a powerful handle.</p>

<p class="c10" id="x.v-p26">4. See what an evil it is to commit ourselves
rashly to our enemies, and to conspirators against us. On this
account Christ used to say, “Give not holy things to the dogs,
neither cast ye your pearls before the swine, lest they turn and
rend you.”<note place="end" n="618" id="x.v-p26.1"><p class="endnote" id="x.v-p27"> <scripRef passage="Matt. vii. 6" id="x.v-p27.1" parsed="|Matt|7|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.7.6">Matt. vii.
6</scripRef>.</p></note> And this
happened in the case of Eve. She gave the holy things to the dog,
to the swine. He trod under foot the words: and turned and rent the
woman. And see how he works evil. “Ye shall not die the death”
saith he.<note place="end" n="619" id="x.v-p27.2"><p class="endnote" id="x.v-p28"> <scripRef passage="Gen. iii. 4" id="x.v-p28.1" parsed="|Gen|3|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.3.4">Gen. iii.
4</scripRef>.</p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="x.v-p29">Give me your attention on this point, that the woman
was able to understand the deceit. For he immediately announced his
enmity, and his warfare against God, he immediately contradicted
Him. Let it be so. Before this thou declaredst the judgment to one
who wished to learn it. After this why didst thou follow one who
said the opposite? God said “ye shall die the death.” The Devil
made answer to this and said “ye shall not die the death.” What
could be clearer than this warfare? From what other quarter ought
one to learn the enemy and the foe, than from his answer returned
to God? She ought then immediately to have fled from the bait, she
ought to have started back from the snare. “Ye shall not die the
death,” saith he “for God knoweth, that on the day on which ye
eat, your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as Gods. In hope of
a greater promise she cast away the goods in her hand. He promised
that he would make them Gods, and cast them down into the tyranny
of death. Whence then O woman didst thou believe the Devil? What
good didst thou discern? Was not the trustworthiness of the
lawgiver sufficient to prove that the one was God, both creator and
framer of the world, and the other the Devil and an enemy? And I do
not say the Devil. Thou thoughtest that he was a mere serpent.
Ought a serpent to claim such equality that thou shouldest tell him
the Master’s judgment? Thou seest that it was possible to
perceive the deceit, but she would not, and yet God gave many
proofs of his own beneficence and shewed forth his care of his
works. For he formed man, who had not existed before; and breathed
a soul into him, and made him according to his image, making him
ruler of all things upon the earth, and granted him a helpmate,
planted Paradise, and having committed to him the use of the rest
of the trees, refused him the taste of one only: and this very
prohibition he made for man’s advantage. But the Devil manifested
no good things by his deed, whether little, or great: but exciting
the woman with mere words and puffing her up with vain hopes, thus
he deceived her. But nevertheless she considered the Devil to be
more worthy of credit than God, although God shewed forth his good
will by his works. The woman believed in one who professed mere
words, and nothing else. Dost thou see how, from folly alone and
sloth, and not from force, the deceit happened? and in order that
thou mayest learn it more clearly hear how the scripture accuses
the woman: For it does not say, being deceived, but “seeing the
tree that it was fair, she ate.” So that the blame belongs to her
uncontrolled vision, not to the deceit alone which comes from the
Devil. For she was defeated by yielding to her own desire, not by
the wickedness. of the Demon. On this account she did not have the
benefit of pardon, but though she said, “the serpent deceived
me,” she paid the uttermost penalty. For it was in her power not
to have fallen. And in <pb n="195" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_195.html" id="x.v-Page_195" />order
that thou mayest understand this more clearly, come, let us conduct
our discourse to the case of Job; from the defeated to the
vanquisher, from the conquered to the conqueror. For this man will
give us greater zeal, so that we may raise our hands against the
Devil. There he who deceived and conquered was a serpent; here the
tempter was a woman, and she did not prevail: and yet at least she
was far more persuasive than he. For to Job after the destruction
of his wealth, after the loss of his children, after being stripped
bare of all his goods, her wiles were added. But in the other case
there was nothing of this kind. Adam did not suffer the destruction
of his children, nor did he lose his wealth: he did not sit upon a
dunghill, but inhabited a Paradise of luxury and enjoyed all manner
of fruits, and fountains and rivers, and every other kind of
security. Nowhere was there labour or pain, or despair and cares,
or reproaches, and insults, or the countless ills which assailed
Job: but nevertheless, when nothing of this kind existed, he fell
and was overthrown. Is it not evident that it was on account of
sloth? Even so therefore as the other, when all these things beset
him, and weighed upon him, stood nobly and did not fall, is it not
evident that his steadfastness was owing to his vigilance of
soul?</p>

<p class="c10" id="x.v-p30">5. On both sides, beloved, reap the utmost gain, and
avoid the imitation of Adam knowing how many ills are begotten of
indolence: and imitate the piety of Job, learning how many glorious
things spring from earnestness. Consider him, the conqueror
throughout, and thou shalt have much consolation in all pain and
peril. For as it were in the common theatre of the world that
blessed and noble man stands forth, and by means of the sufferings
which happened to him discourses to all to bear all things which
befal them nobly, and never give in to the troubles which come upon
them. For verily, there is no human suffering which cannot receive
consolation from thence. For the sufferings which are scattered
over the whole world, these came together, and bore down upon one
body, even his. What pardon then shall there be for him who is
unable to bear with thankfulness his share of the troubles which
are brought upon him? Since he appears not bearing a part only, but
the entire ills of all men, and in order that thou mayest not
condemn the extravagance of my words, come, and let us take in hand
severally the ills that came upon him, and bring forward this
fulfilment of them. And if thou wishest, let us first bring forward
that which seems to be the most unendurable of all, I mean poverty,
and the pain which arises from it. For everywhere all men bewail
this. What was poorer then than Job, who was poorer than the
outcasts at the baths, and those who sleep in the ashes of the
furnace, poorer in fact than all men? For these indeed have one
ragged garment, but he sat naked, and had only the garment which
nature supplies, the clothing of the flesh, and this the Devil
destroyed on all sides, with a distressing kind of decay. Again
these poor folk are at least under the roof of the porches at the
baths, and are covered with a shelter. But he continued always to
pass his nights in the open air, not having even the consolation of
a bare roof. And, what is still greater, the fact that these are
conscious of many terrible evils within themselves, but he was
conscious of nothing against himself. For this is to be noticed in
each of the things which happened to him, a thing which caused him
greater pain, and produced more perplexity; the ignorance of the
reason of what took place. These persons then, as I said, would
have many things with which to reproach themselves. And this
contributes no little to consolation in calamity; to be conscious
in oneself of being punished justly. But he was deprived of this
consolation, and while exhibiting a conversation full of virtue,
endured the fate of those who had dared to do extreme wickedness.
And these folk who are with us, are poor from the outset, and from
the beginning are versed in calamity. But he endured calamity in
which he was unversed, experiencing the immense change from wealth.
As then the knowledge of the cause of what takes place, is the
greatest consolation; so it is not less than this, to have been
versed in poverty from the beginning, and so to continue in it. Of
both these consolations that man was deprived, and not even then,
did he fall away. Dost thou see him indeed come to extreme poverty,
even in comparison with which it is impossible to find a fellow?
For what could be poorer than the naked who has not even a roof
over him? Yea rather not even was it in his power to enjoy the bare
ground, but he sat upon the dunghill. Therefore whenever thou seest
thyself come to poverty, consider the suffering of the just one,
and straightway thou shalt rise up, and shake off every thought of
despondency. This one calamity therefore seems to men to be the
groundwork of all sufferings together. And the second after it, yea
rather before it, is the affliction of the body. Who then was even
so disabled? Who endured such disease? Who received or saw any one
else receive so great an affliction? No one. Little by little his
body was wasted, and a stream of worms on every side issued from
his limbs, the running was constant, and the evil smell which
surrounded him was 
<pb n="196" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_196.html" id="x.v-Page_196" />strong, and the body being destroyed little
by little, and decaying with such putrefaction, used to make food
distasteful and hunger was to him strange and unusual. For not even
was he able to enjoy the nourishment which was given to him. For
saith he “I see my food to be loathsome.”<note place="end" n="620" id="x.v-p30.1"><p class="endnote" id="x.v-p31"> <scripRef passage="Job vi. 7" id="x.v-p31.1" parsed="|Job|6|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Job.6.7">Job vi.
7</scripRef>.</p></note> Whenever then thou fallest into
weakness, O man, remember that body and that saintly flesh. For it
was saintly and pure, even when it had so many wounds. And if any
one belong to the army, and then unjustly and without any
reasonable pretext, be hanged upon the pillory, and has his sides
rasped to pieces, let him not think the matter to be a reproach,
nor let him give way to the pain when he thinks upon this saint.
But this man, says one, has much comfort and consolation in knowing
that God was bringing these sufferings upon him. This indeed
especially troubled and disturbed him, to think that the just God
who had in every way been served by him, was at war with him. And
he was not able to find any reasonable pretext for what took place,
since, when at least he afterwards learned the cause, see what
piety he shewed, for when God said to him “Dost thou think that I
have had dealings with thee in order that thou mightest appear
righteous?”<note place="end" n="621" id="x.v-p31.2"><p class="endnote" id="x.v-p32"> <scripRef passage="Job xl. 8" id="x.v-p32.1" parsed="|Job|40|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Job.40.8">Job xl.
8</scripRef>.</p></note>
conscious-stricken he says “I will lay my hand upon my mouth,
once have I spoken but to a second word I will not proceed,”<note place="end" n="622" id="x.v-p32.2"><p class="endnote" id="x.v-p33"> <scripRef passage="Job xl. 4, 5" id="x.v-p33.1" parsed="|Job|40|4|40|5" osisRef="Bible:Job.40.4-Job.40.5">Job xl. 4,
5</scripRef>.</p></note> and again
“as far as the hearing of the ear I have heard thee before, but
now mine eye hath seen thee, wherefore I have held myself to be
vile, and am wasted away, and I consider myself to be earth and
ashes.”<note place="end" n="623" id="x.v-p33.2"><p class="endnote" id="x.v-p34"> <scripRef passage="Job xlii. 5, 6" id="x.v-p34.1" parsed="|Job|42|5|42|6" osisRef="Bible:Job.42.5-Job.42.6">Job xlii.
5, 6</scripRef>.</p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="x.v-p35">6. But if thou thinkest that this is sufficient for
consolation, thou wilt thyself also be able to experience this
comfort. And even if thou dost not suffer any of these misfortunes
at the hands of God but owing to the insolence of men; and yet
givest thanks and dost not blaspheme him who is able to prevent
them indeed, but who permits them for the sake of testing thee:
just as they who suffer at the hands of God are crowned, so also
thou shalt obtain the same reward, because thou hast borne nobly
the calamities which were brought upon thee from men, and didst
give thanks to him who was able indeed to hinder them, but not
willing.</p>

<p class="c10" id="x.v-p36">Behold then! thou hast seen poverty and
disease, and both in the extremest degree brought upon this just
man. Dost thou wish that I should shew thee the warfare at
nature’s hands, in such excessive degree waged then against this
noble man? He lost ten children, the ten at one fell swoop, the ten
in the very bloom of youth, ten who displayed much virtue, and that
not by the common law of nature, but by a violent and pitiable
death. Who could be able to recount so great a calamity? No one.
Whenever therefore thou losest son and daughter together, have
recourse to this just man, and thou shalt find altogether much
comfort for thyself. Were these then the only misfortunes which
happened to him? The desertion and treachery of his friends, and
the gibes, and raillery, and the mockery and derision, and the
tearing in pieces by all, was something intolerable. For the
character of calamities is not of such a kind, that they who
reproach us about our calamities are wont to vex our soul. Not only
was there no one to soothe him but many even on many sides beset
him with taunts. And thou seest him lamenting this bitterly, and
saying “but even you too fell upon me.”<note place="end" n="624" id="x.v-p36.1"><p class="endnote" id="x.v-p37"> <scripRef passage="Job xix. 5" id="x.v-p37.1" parsed="|Job|19|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Job.19.5">Job xix.

says “My neighbours have rejected me, and my servants spake
against me, and I called the sons of my concubines, and they turned
away from me.”<note place="end" n="625" id="x.v-p37.2"><p class="endnote" id="x.v-p38"> <scripRef passage="Job xix. 14, 16" id="x.v-p38.1" parsed="|Job|19|14|0|0;|Job|19|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Job.19.14 Bible:Job.19.16">Job xix.

of all.<note place="end" n="626" id="x.v-p38.2"><p class="endnote" id="x.v-p39"> <scripRef passage="Job xix. 9, 10" id="x.v-p39.1" parsed="|Job|19|9|19|10" osisRef="Bible:Job.19.9-Job.19.10">Job xix.

31</scripRef>.</p></note> These things at least are
unbearable to hear, still more to endure in their reality, extreme
poverty, and intolerable disease new and strange, the loss of
children so many and so good, and in such a manner, reproaches and
gibes, and insults from men. Some indeed mocked and some reproached
and others despised; not only enemies, but even friends; not only
friends, but even servants, and they not only mock and reproach,
but even abhorred him, and this not for two or three, or ten days,
but for many months; and (a circumstance which happened in that
man’s case alone) not even had he comfort by night, but the
delusions of terrors by night were a greater aggravation of his
misfortunes by day. For that he endured more grievous things in his
sleep, hear what he says “why dost thou frighten me in sleep, and
terrify me in visions?”<note place="end" n="628" id="x.v-p40.2"><p class="endnote" id="x.v-p41"> <scripRef passage="Job vii. 14" id="x.v-p41.1" parsed="|Job|7|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Job.7.14">Job vii.
14</scripRef>.</p></note> What man of iron, what heart of
steel could have endured so many misfortunes? For if each of these
was unbearable in itself, consider what a tumult their simultaneous
approach excited. But nevertheless he bore all these, and in all
that happened to him he sinned not, nor was there guile in his
lips.</p>

<p class="c10" id="x.v-p42">7. Let the sufferings of that man then be the
medicines for our ills, and his grievous surging sea the harbour of
our sufferings, and in each of the accidents which befal us, let us
consider this saint, and seeing one person ex<pb n="197" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_197.html" id="x.v-Page_197" />hausting the misfortunes of the
universe, we shall conduct ourselves bravely in those which fall to
our share, and as to some affectionate mother, stretching forth her
hands on all sides, and receiving and reviving her terrified
children, so let us always flee to this book, and even if the
pitiable troubles of all men assail us, let us take sufficient
comfort for all and so depart. And if thou sayest, he was Job, and
for this reason bore all this, but I am not like him; thou
suppliest me with a greater accusation against thyself and fresh
praise of him. For it is more likely that thou shouldest be able to
bear all this than he. Why pray? Because he indeed was before the
day of grace and of the law, when there was not much strictness of
life, when the grace of the Spirit was not so great, when sin was
hard to fight against, when the curse prevailed and when death was
terrible. But now our wrestlings have become easier, all these
things being removed after the coming of Christ; so that we have no
excuse, when we are unable to reach the same standard as he, after
so long a time, and such advantage, and so many gifts given to us
by God. Considering therefore all these things, that misfortunes
were greater for him, and that when the conflict was more grievous,
then he stripped for the contest; let us bear all that comes upon
us nobly, and with much thankfulness, in order that we may be able
to obtain the same crown as he, by the grace and lovingkindness of
Jesus Christ our Lord, with whom be glory to the Father together
with the Holy Spirit, now and always and for ever and ever.
Amen.</p>

<p class="c33" id="xi.ii-p2">————————————</p>

<p class="c38" id="xi.ii-p3">On the passage “Father if it be possible let this
cup pass from me, nevertheless not as I will but as thou wilt:”
and against Marcionists and Manichæans: also, that we ought not to
rush into danger, but to prefer the will of God before every other
will.</p>

<p class="c9" id="xi.ii-p4">1. <span class="c12" id="xi.ii-p4.1">I lately</span> inflicted
a severe stroke upon those who are grasping and wish to overreach
others;<note place="end" n="629" id="xi.ii-p4.2"><p class="endnote" id="xi.ii-p5"> This was such a very common topic with Chrysostom
that it affords no clue to the date of the Homily.</p></note> I did this
not in order to wound them but in order to correct them; not
because I hate the men, but because I detest their wickedness. For
so the physician also lances the abscess, not as making an attack
upon the suffering body, but as a means of contending with the
disorder and the wound. Well to-day let us grant them a little
respite, that they may recover from their distress, and not recoil
from the remedy by being perpetually afflicted. Physicians also act
thus; after the use of the knife they apply plasters and drugs, and
let a few days pass whilst they devise things to allay the pain.
Following their example let me today, devising means for them to
derive benefit from my discourse, start a question concerning
doctrine, directing my speech to the words which have been read.
For I imagine that many feel perplexed as to the reason why these
words were uttered by Christ: and it is probable also that any
heretics who are present may pounce upon the words, and thereby
upset many of the more simple-minded brethren.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xi.ii-p6">In order then to build a wall against their attack
and to relieve those who are in perplexity from bewilderment and
confusion, let us take in hand the words which have been cited, and
dwell upon the passage, and dive into the depths of its meanings.
For reading does not suffice unless knowledge also be added to it.
Even as the eunuch of Candace read, but until one came who
instructed him in the meaning of what he was reading he derived no
great benefit from it. In order therefore that you may not be in
the same condition attend to what is said, exert your
understanding, let me have your mind disengaged from other
thoughts, let your eye be quick-sighted, your intention earnest:
let your soul be set free from worldly cares, that we may not sow
our words upon the thorns, or upon the rock, or by the way side,
but that we may till a deep and rich field, and so reap an abundant
harvest. For if you thus attend to what is said you will render my
labour lighter and facilitate the discovery of that which you are
seeking.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xi.ii-p7">What then is the meaning of the passage which has
been read “Father if it be possible let this cup pass from me?”
What does the saying mean? For we ought to unlock the passage by
first giving a clear interpretation of the words. What then does
the saying mean? “Father if it be possible take away the
cross.” How sayest thou? is he ignorant whether this be possible
or impossible? Who would venture to say this? Yet the words are
those of one who is ignorant: for the addition of the word
“if,” is indicative of doubt: but as I said we must not attend
to the words merely, but turn our attention to the sense, and learn
the aim of the speaker, and the cause and the occasion, and by
putting all these things together turn out the hidden meaning. The
unspeakable Wisdom then, who knoweth the Father even as the Father
knoweth the Son, how should he have been ignorant of this? <pb n="202" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_202.html" id="xi.ii-Page_202" />For this knowledge concerning
His passion was not greater than the knowledge concerning His
essential nature, which He alone accurately knew. “For as the
Father knoweth me” He says “even so know I the Father.”<note place="end" n="630" id="xi.ii-p7.1"><p class="endnote" id="xi.ii-p8"> <scripRef passage="John x. 15" id="xi.ii-p8.1" parsed="|John|10|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.10.15">John x.
15</scripRef>.</p></note> And why do I
speak of the only begotten Son of God? For even the prophets appear
not to have been ignorant of this fact, but to have known it
clearly, and to have declared beforehand with much assurance that
so it must come to pass, and would certainly be.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xi.ii-p9">Hear at least how variously all announce the
cross. First of all the patriarch Jacob: for directing his
discourse to Him he says “Out of a tender shoot didst thou spring
up:”<note place="end" n="631" id="xi.ii-p9.1"><p class="endnote" id="xi.ii-p10"> <scripRef passage="Gen. xlix. 9" id="xi.ii-p10.1" parsed="|Gen|49|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.49.9">Gen. xlix.
9</scripRef>. Septuagint
rendering.</p></note> by the word
shoot signifying the Virgin and the undefiled nature of Mary. Then
indicating the cross he said “Thou didst lie down and slumber as
a lion, and as a lion’s whelp; who shall raise him up?”<note place="end" n="632" id="xi.ii-p10.2"><p class="endnote" id="xi.ii-p11"> <scripRef passage="Gen. 49.9" id="xi.ii-p11.1" parsed="|Gen|49|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.49.9"><i>Ibid</i></scripRef>.</p></note> Here he
called death a slumbering and a sleep, and with death he combined
the resurrection when he said “who shall raise him up?” No one
indeed save he himself—wherefore also Christ said “I have power
to lay down my life, and I have power to take it again,”<note place="end" n="633" id="xi.ii-p11.2"><p class="endnote" id="xi.ii-p12"> <scripRef passage="John x. 18" id="xi.ii-p12.1" parsed="|John|10|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.10.18">John x.
18</scripRef>.</p></note> and again
“Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up.”<note place="end" n="634" id="xi.ii-p12.2"><p class="endnote" id="xi.ii-p13"> <scripRef passage="John ii. 19" id="xi.ii-p13.1" parsed="|John|2|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.2.19">John ii.
19</scripRef>.</p></note> And what is
meant by the words “thou didst lie down and slumber as a lion?”
For as the lion is terrible not only when he is awake but even when
he is sleeping, so Christ also not only before the cross but also
on the cross itself and in the very moment of death was terrible,
and wrought at that time great miracles, turning back the light of
the sun, cleaving the rocks, shaking the earth, rending the veil,
alarming the wife of Pilate, convicting Judas of sin, for then he
said “I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent
blood;”<note place="end" n="635" id="xi.ii-p13.2"><p class="endnote" id="xi.ii-p14"> <scripRef passage="Matt. xxvii. 4" id="xi.ii-p14.1" parsed="|Matt|27|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.27.4">Matt.
xxvii. 4</scripRef>.</p></note> and the wife
of Pilate declared “Have nothing to do with that just man, for I
have suffered many things in a dream because of Him.”<note place="end" n="636" id="xi.ii-p14.2"><p class="endnote" id="xi.ii-p15"> <scripRef passage="Matt. xxvii. 19" id="xi.ii-p15.1" parsed="|Matt|27|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.27.19">Matt.
xxvii. 19</scripRef>.</p></note> The darkness
took possession of the earth, and night appeared at midday, then
death was brought to nought, and his tyranny was destroyed: many
bodies at least of the saints which slept arose. These things the
patriarch declaring beforehand, and demonstrating that, even when
crucified, Christ would be terrible, said “thou didst lie down
and slumber as a lion.” He did not say thou shalt slumber but
thou didst slumber, because it would certainly come to pass. For it
is the custom of the prophets in many places to predict things to
come as if they were already past. For just as it is impossible
that things which have happened should not have happened, so is it
impossible that this should not happen, although it be future. On
this account they predict things to come under the semblance of
past time, indicating by this means the impossibility of their
failure, the certainty of their coming to pass. So also spake
David, signifying the cross; “They pierced my hands and my
feet.”<note place="end" n="637" id="xi.ii-p15.2"><p class="endnote" id="xi.ii-p16"> <scripRef passage="Ps. xxii. 17" id="xi.ii-p16.1" parsed="|Ps|22|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.22.17">Ps. xxii.

say they “shall pierce” but “they pierced” “they counted
all my bones.”<note place="end" n="638" id="xi.ii-p16.2"><p class="endnote" id="xi.ii-p17"> <scripRef passage="Ps. xxii. 18" id="xi.ii-p17.1" parsed="|Ps|22|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.22.18">Ps. xxii.

does he say this, but he also describes the things which were done
by the soldiers. “They parted my garments among themselves, and
upon my vesture did they cast lots.”<note place="end" n="639" id="xi.ii-p17.2"><p class="endnote" id="xi.ii-p18"> <scripRef passage="Ps. xxii. 19" id="xi.ii-p18.1" parsed="|Ps|22|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.22.19">Ps. xxii.

relates they gave Him gall to eat, and vinegar to drink. For he
says “they gave me gall for my food, and for my thirst they gave
me vinegar to drink.”<note place="end" n="640" id="xi.ii-p18.2"><p class="endnote" id="xi.ii-p19"> <scripRef passage="Ps. lxix. 22" id="xi.ii-p19.1" parsed="|Ps|69|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.69.22">Ps. lxix.

they smote him with a spear, for “they shall look on Him whom
they pierced.”<note place="end" n="641" id="xi.ii-p19.2"><p class="endnote" id="xi.ii-p20"> <scripRef passage="Zech. xii. 10" id="xi.ii-p20.1" parsed="|Zech|12|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Zech.12.10">Zech. xii.
10</scripRef>.</p></note> Esaias again
in another fashion predicting the cross said “He was led as a
sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb before his shearer is dumb,
so openeth he not his mouth.” “In his humiliation his judgment
was taken away.”<note place="end" n="642" id="xi.ii-p20.2"><p class="endnote" id="xi.ii-p21"> <scripRef passage="Isa. liii. 7, 8" id="xi.ii-p21.1" parsed="|Isa|53|7|53|8" osisRef="Bible:Isa.53.7-Isa.53.8">Isa. liii.

<p class="c10" id="xi.ii-p22">2. Now observe I pray how each one of these
writers speaks as if concerning things already past, signifying by
the use of this tense the absolute inevitable certainty of the
event. So also David, describing this tribunal, said, “Why did
the heathen rage and the people imagine vain things? The Kings of
the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against
the Lord and against his Christ.”<note place="end" n="643" id="xi.ii-p22.1"><p class="endnote" id="xi.ii-p23"> <scripRef passage="Ps. ii. 1, 2" id="xi.ii-p23.1" parsed="|Ps|2|1|2|2" osisRef="Bible:Ps.2.1-Ps.2.2">Ps. ii. 1,

trial, and the cross, and the incidents on the cross, but also him
who betrayed him, declaring that he was his familiar companion and
guest. “For,” he saith, “he that eateth bread with me did
magnify his heel against me.”<note place="end" n="644" id="xi.ii-p23.2"><p class="endnote" id="xi.ii-p24"> <scripRef passage="Ps. xli. 9" id="xi.ii-p24.1" parsed="|Ps|41|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.41.9">Ps. xli.

voice which Christ was to utter on the cross saying “My God, My
God why hast thou forsaken me?”<note place="end" n="645" id="xi.ii-p24.2"><p class="endnote" id="xi.ii-p25"> <scripRef passage="Ps. xxii. 1" id="xi.ii-p25.1" parsed="|Ps|22|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.22.1">Ps. xxii.

describe: “They laid me in the lowest pit, in dark places, and in
the shadow of death.”<note place="end" n="646" id="xi.ii-p25.2"><p class="endnote" id="xi.ii-p26"> <scripRef passage="Ps. lxxxviii. 5" id="xi.ii-p26.1" parsed="|Ps|88|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.88.5">Ps.

up with a merry noise, the Lord with the sound of the trump.”<note place="end" n="648" id="xi.ii-p27.2"><p class="endnote" id="xi.ii-p28"> <scripRef passage="Ps. xlvii. 5" id="xi.ii-p28.1" parsed="|Ps|47|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.47.5">Ps. xlvii.

also declares the cause; saying, “for the transgressions of

6, 7</scripRef>.</p></note> Then also he adds mention of the
result, saying “by his stripes we have all been healed:”<note place="end" n="652" id="xi.ii-p31.2"><p class="endnote" id="xi.ii-p32"> <scripRef passage="Isa. liii. 5" id="xi.ii-p32.1" parsed="|Isa|53|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.53.5">Isa. liii.

12</scripRef>.</p></note> The prophets then knew the cross,
and the cause of the cross and that which was effected by it, and
the burial and the resurrection, and the ascension, and the
betrayal, and the trial, and described them all with accuracy: and
is He who sent them and commanded them to speak these things
ignorant of them Himself? What reasonable man would say that? Seest
thou that we must not attend merely to the words? For this is not
the only perplexing passage, but what follows is more perplexing.
For what does He say? “Father if it be possible let this cup pass
from me.” Here he will be found to speak not only as if ignorant,
but as if deprecating the cross: For this is what He says. “If it
be permissible let me not be subjected to crucifixion and death.”
And yet when Peter, the leader of the apostles, said this to Him,
“Be it far from thee Lord, this shall not happen unto Thee,” He
rebuked him so severely as to say; “get thee behind me Satan,
thou art an offence unto me, for thou savourest not the things
which be of God, but those which be of men:”<note place="end" n="654" id="xi.ii-p33.2"><p class="endnote" id="xi.ii-p34"> <scripRef passage="Matt. xvi. 22, 23" id="xi.ii-p34.1" parsed="|Matt|16|22|16|23" osisRef="Bible:Matt.16.22-Matt.16.23">Matt. xvi.
22, 23</scripRef>.</p></note> although a short time before he had
pronounced him blessed. But to escape crucifixion seemed to Him so
monstrous a thing, that him who had received the revelation from
the Father, him whom He had pronounced blessed, him who had
received the keys of Heaven, He called Satan, and an offence, and
accused him of not savouring the things which be of God because he
said to Him, “Be it far from thee Lord, this shall never be unto
Thee”—namely crucifixion. He then who thus vituperated the
disciple, and poured such an invective upon him as actually to call
him Satan (after having bestowed such great praise on him), because
he said “avoid crucifixion,” how could He desire not to be
crucified? and how after these things when drawing the picture of
the good shepherd could He declare this to be the special proof of
his virtue, that he should be sacrificed for the sake of the sheep,
thus saying, “I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd layeth
down his life for the sheep?”<note place="end" n="655" id="xi.ii-p34.2"><p class="endnote" id="xi.ii-p35"> <scripRef passage="John x. 11" id="xi.ii-p35.1" parsed="|John|10|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.10.11">John x.
11</scripRef>.</p></note> Nor did He even stop there, but
also added, “but he that is an hireling and not the shepherd
seeth the wolf coming and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth.”<note place="end" n="656" id="xi.ii-p35.2"><p class="endnote" id="xi.ii-p36"> <scripRef passage="John x. 12" id="xi.ii-p36.1" parsed="|John|10|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.10.12">John x.
12</scripRef>.</p></note> If then it
is the sign of the good shepherd to sacrifice himself, and of the
hireling to be unwilling to undergo this, how can He who calls
Himself the good shepherd beseech that he may not be sacrificed?
And how could He say “I lay down my life of myself”? For if
thou layest down thy life of thyself, how canst thou beseech
another that thou mayest not lay it down? And how is it that Paul
marvels at Him on account of this declaration, saying “Who being
in the form of God counted it not a prize to be on an equality with
God, but emptied Himself taking the form of a servant, being made
in the likeness of men, and being found in fashion as a man he
humbled himself, becoming obedient even unto death, yea, the death
of the cross.”<note place="end" n="657" id="xi.ii-p36.2"><p class="endnote" id="xi.ii-p37"> <scripRef passage="Phil. ii. 6-8" id="xi.ii-p37.1" parsed="|Phil|2|6|2|8" osisRef="Bible:Phil.2.6-Phil.2.8">Phil. ii.

Himself again speaks in this wise, “For this cause doth my Father
love me, because I lay down my life that I may take it again.”<note place="end" n="658" id="xi.ii-p37.2"><p class="endnote" id="xi.ii-p38"> <scripRef passage="John x. 17" id="xi.ii-p38.1" parsed="|John|10|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.10.17">John x.
17</scripRef>.</p></note> For if He
does not desire to lay it down, but deprecates the act, and
beseeches the Father, how is it that He is loved on this account?
For love is of those who are like minded. And how does Paul say
again “Love one another even as Christ also loved us and gave
Himself for us?”<note place="end" n="659" id="xi.ii-p38.2"><p class="endnote" id="xi.ii-p39"> <scripRef passage="Ephes. v. 2" id="xi.ii-p39.1" parsed="|Eph|5|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Eph.5.2">Ephes. v.

about to be crucified said “Father, the hour has come: glorify
thy Son,”<note place="end" n="660" id="xi.ii-p39.2"><p class="endnote" id="xi.ii-p40"> <scripRef passage="John xvii. 1" id="xi.ii-p40.1" parsed="|John|17|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.17.1">John xvii.
1</scripRef>.</p></note> speaking of
the cross as glory: and how then does He deprecate it here when He
urges it there? For that the cross is glory listen to what the
evangelist says “the Holy Ghost was not yet given, because Jesus
was not yet glorified.”<note place="end" n="661" id="xi.ii-p40.2"><p class="endnote" id="xi.ii-p41"> <scripRef passage="John vii. 39" id="xi.ii-p41.1" parsed="|John|7|39|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.7.39">John vii.
39</scripRef>.</p></note> Now the hearing of this expression
is “grace was not yet given because the enmity towards men was
not yet destroyed by reason that the cross had not yet done its
work.” For the cross destroyed the enmity of God towards man,
brought about the reconciliation, made the earth Heaven, associated
men with angels, pulled down the citadel of death, unstrung the
force of the devil, extinguished the power of sin, delivered the
world from error, brought back the truth, expelled the Demons,
destroyed temples, overturned altars, suppressed the sacrificial
offering, implanted virtue, founded the Churches. The cross is the
will of the Father, the glory of the Son, the rejoicing of the
Spirit, the boast of Paul, “for,” he says, “God forbid that I
should boast save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.”<note place="end" n="662" id="xi.ii-p41.2"><p class="endnote" id="xi.ii-p42"> <scripRef passage="Gal. vi. 14" id="xi.ii-p42.1" parsed="|Gal|6|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gal.6.14">Gal. vi.
14</scripRef>.</p></note> The cross is
that which is brighter than the sun, more brilliant than the
sunbeam: for when the sun is darkened then the cross shines
brightly: and the sun is darkened not because it is extinguished,
but because it is overpowered by the brilliancy of the cross. The
cross has broken our bond, it has made the prison of death
ineffectual, it is the demonstration of the love of God.
“For <pb n="204" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_204.html" id="xi.ii-Page_204" />God so

the impregnable wall, the invulnerable shield, the safeguard of the
rich, the resource of the poor, the defence of those who are
exposed to snares, the armour of those who are attacked, the means
of suppressing passion, and of acquiring virtue, the wonderful and
marvellous sign. “For this generation seeketh after a sign: and

Paul says, “for the Jews ask for a sign and the Greeks seek

brought in the robber, it conducted into the kingdom of Heaven the
race of man which was about to perish, and was not worthy even of
earth. So great are the benefits which have sprung and do spring
from the cross, and yet doth He not desire to be crucified I ask?
Who would venture to say this? And if He did not desire it who
compelled Him, who forced Him to it? and why did He send prophets
beforehand announcing that He would be crucified, if He was not to
be, and did not wish to undergo it? And for what reason does He
call the cross a cup, if He did not desire to be crucified? For
that is the word of one who signifies the desire which he has
concerning the act. For as the cup is sweet to those who are
thirsty so also was crucifixion to Him: wherefore also He said
“With desire have I desired to eat this Passover with you,”<note place="end" n="667" id="xi.ii-p46.2"><p class="endnote" id="xi.ii-p47"> <scripRef passage="Luke xxii. 15" id="xi.ii-p47.1" parsed="|Luke|22|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.22.15">Luke xxii.

meant not absolutely, but relatively, because after that evening
the cross was awaiting Him.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xi.ii-p48">3. He then who calls the thing glory, and
rebukes the disciple because he was trying to hinder Him, and
proves that what constitutes the good shepherd is his sacrificing
himself on behalf of the sheep, and declares that he earnestly
longs for this thing, and willingly goes to meet it, how is it that
He beseeches it may not come to pass? And if He did not wish it
what difficulty was there in hindering those who came for that
purpose? But in fact you behold Him hastening towards the deed. At
least when they came upon Him He said “Whom seek ye?” and they
replied “Jesus.” Then He saith to them “Lo! I am He: and they
went backward and fell to the ground.”<note place="end" n="668" id="xi.ii-p48.1"><p class="endnote" id="xi.ii-p49"> <scripRef passage="John xviii. 6" id="xi.ii-p49.1" parsed="|John|18|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.18.6">John

proved that He was able to escape their hands, He then surrendered
Himself, that thou mightest learn that not by compulsion or force,
or the tyrannical power of those who attacked Him, did He
unwillingly submit to this, but willingly with purpose and desire,
preparing for it a long time before. Therefore also were prophets
sent beforehand, and patriarchs foretold the events, and by means
of words and deeds the cross was prefigured. For the sacrifice of
Isaac also signified the cross to us: wherefore also Christ said
“Abraham your father rejoiced to see my glory and he saw it and
was glad.”<note place="end" n="669" id="xi.ii-p49.2"><p class="endnote" id="xi.ii-p50"> <scripRef passage="John viii. 56" id="xi.ii-p50.1" parsed="|John|8|56|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.8.56">John viii.

patriarch then was glad beholding the image of the cross, and does
He Himself deprecate it? Thus Moses also prevailed over Amalek when
he displayed the figure of the cross: and one may observe countless
things happening in the Old Testament descriptive by anticipation
of the cross. For what reason then was this the case if He who was
to be crucified did not wish it to come to pass? And the sentence
which follows this is yet more perplexing. For having said “Let
this cup pass from me He added “nevertheless not as I will but as
Thou wilt.”<note place="end" n="670" id="xi.ii-p50.2"><p class="endnote" id="xi.ii-p51"> <scripRef passage="Matt. xxvi. 39" id="xi.ii-p51.1" parsed="|Matt|26|39|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.26.39">Matt.

as far as the actual expression is concerned we find two wills
opposed to one another: if at least the Father desires Him to be
crucified, but He Himself does not desire it. And yet we everywhere
behold Him desiring and purposing the same things as the Father.

purpose of the Father and of the Son is one. And when He says

say this as signifying that He has been deprived of authority,
either to speak or to act (away with the thought!), but as desiring
to prove the concord of his purpose, both in words and deeds, and
in every kind of transaction, to be one and the same with the
Father, as I have already frequently demonstrated. For the
expression “I speak not of myself” is not an abrogation of
authority but a demonstration of agreement. How then does He say
here “Nevertheless not as I will but as Thou wilt”? Perhaps I
have excited a great conflict in your mind, but be on the alert:
for although many words have been uttered I know well that your
zeal is still fresh: for the discourse is now hastening on to the
solution. Why then has this form of speech been employed? Attend
carefully, The doctrine of the incarnation was very hard to
receive. For the exceeding measure of His lovingkindness and the
magnitude of His con<pb n="205" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_205.html" id="xi.ii-Page_205" />descension were full of awe,
and needed much preparation to be accepted. For consider what a

not even the Cherubim were able to bear but veiled their faces by
the shelter of their wings, that this God who surpasses all
understanding, and baffles all calculation, having passed by
angels, archangels, and all the spiritual powers above, deigned to
become man, and to take flesh formed of earth and clay, and enter
the womb of a virgin, and be borne there the space of nine months,
and be nourished with milk, and suffer all things to which man is
liable. Inasmuch then as that which was to happen was so strange as
to be disbelieved by many even when it had taken place, He first of
all sends prophets beforehand, announcing this very fact. For
instance the patriarch predicted it saying “Thou didst spring

noiselessly and gently entered into the Virgin’s womb.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xi.ii-p65">4. But these proofs alone did not suffice, but
even when He had come, lest what had taken place should be deemed
an illusion, He warranted the fact not only by the sight but by
duration of time and by passing through all the phases incident to
man. For He did not enter once for all into a man matured and
completely developed, but into a virgin’s womb, so as to undergo
the process of gestation and birth and suckling and growth, and by
the length of the time and the variety of the stages of growth to
give assurance of what had come to pass. And not even here were the
proofs concluded, but even when bearing about the body of flesh He
suffered it to experience the infirmities of human nature and to be
hungry, and thirsty, and to sleep and feel fatigue; finally also
when He came to the cross He suffered it to undergo the pains of
the flesh. For this reason also streams of sweat flowed down from
it and an angel was discovered strengthening it, and He was sad and
down-cast: for before He uttered these words He said “my soul is
troubled, and exceeding sorrowful ever unto death.”<note place="end" n="684" id="xi.ii-p65.1"><p class="endnote" id="xi.ii-p66"> <scripRef passage="Matt. xxvi. 38" id="xi.ii-p66.1" parsed="|Matt|26|38|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.26.38">Matt.

after all these things have taken place the wicked mouth of the
devil speaking through Marcion of Pontus, and Valentinus, and
Manichæus of Persia and many more heretics, has attempted to
overthrow the doctrine of the Incarnation and has vented a
diabolical utterance declaring that He did not become flesh, nor
was clothed with it, but that this was mere fancy, and illusion, a
piece of acting and pretence, although the sufferings, the death,
the burial, the thirst, cry aloud against this teaching; supposing
that none of these things had happened would not the devil have
sown these wicked doctrines of impiousness much more widely? For
this reason, just as He hungered, as He slept, as He felt fatigue,
as He ate and drank, so also did He deprecate death, thereby
manifesting his humanity, and that infirmity of human nature which
does not submit without pain to be torn from this present life. For
had He not uttered any of these things, it might have been said
that if He were a man He ought to have experienced human feelings.
And what are these? in the case of one about to be crucified, fear
and agony, and pain in being torn from present life: for a sense of
the charm which surrounds present things is implanted in human
nature: on this account wishing to prove the reality of the fleshly
clothing, and to give assurance of the incarnation He manifests the
actual feelings of man with full demonstration.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xi.ii-p67">This is one consideration, but there is another no
less important. And what is this? Christ having come to earth
wished to instruct men in all virtue: now the instructor teaches
not only by word, but also by deed: for this is the teacher’s
best method of teaching. A pilot for instance when he makes the
apprentice sit by his side shows him how he handles the rudder, but
he also joins speech to action, and does not depend upon words
alone or example <pb n="206" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_206.html" id="xi.ii-Page_206" />alone:
in like manner also an architect when he has placed by his side the
man who is intended to learn from him how a wall is constructed,
shows him the way by means of action as well as by means of oral
teaching; so also with the weaver, and embroiderer, and gold
refiner, and coppersmith;—and every kind of art has teachers who
instruct both orally and practically. Inasmuch then as Christ
Himself came to instruct us in all virtue, He both tells us what
ought to be done, and does it. “For,” he says, “he who does
and teaches the same shall be called great in the kingdom of
heaven.”<note place="end" n="685" id="xi.ii-p67.1"><p class="endnote" id="xi.ii-p68"> <scripRef passage="Matt. v. 19" id="xi.ii-p68.1" parsed="|Matt|5|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.19">Matt. v.

He commanded men to be lowly-minded, and meek, and He taught this
by His words: but see how He also teaches it by His deeds. For
having said “Blessed are the poor in spirit, blessed are the
meek,”<note place="end" n="686" id="xi.ii-p68.2"><p class="endnote" id="xi.ii-p69"> <scripRef passage="Matt. v. 3, 4" id="xi.ii-p69.1" parsed="|Matt|5|3|5|4" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.3-Matt.5.4">Matt. v.
3, 4</scripRef>.</p></note> He shows how
these virtues ought to be practised. How then did He teach them? He
took a towel and girded Himself and washed the disciples’ feet.<note place="end" n="687" id="xi.ii-p69.2"><p class="endnote" id="xi.ii-p70"> <scripRef passage="John xiii. 4, 5" id="xi.ii-p70.1" parsed="|John|13|4|13|5" osisRef="Bible:John.13.4-John.13.5">John xiii.
4, 5</scripRef>.</p></note> What can
match this lowliness of mind? for He teaches this virtue no longer
by His words only but also by His deeds. Again He teaches meekness
and forbearance by His acts. How so? He was struck on the face by
the servant of the high priest, and said “If I have spoken evil
bear witness of the evil: but if well why smitest thou me?”<note place="end" n="688" id="xi.ii-p70.2"><p class="endnote" id="xi.ii-p71"> <scripRef passage="John xviii. 23" id="xi.ii-p71.1" parsed="|John|18|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.18.23">John

men to pray for their enemies: this also again He teaches by means
of His acts: for when He had ascended the cross He said “Father
forgive them for they know not what they do.”<note place="end" n="689" id="xi.ii-p71.2"><p class="endnote" id="xi.ii-p72"> <scripRef passage="Luke xxiii. 34" id="xi.ii-p72.1" parsed="|Luke|23|34|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.23.34">Luke

pray so does He Himself pray, instructing thee to do so by his own
unflagging utterances of prayer. Again He commanded us to do good

did by his own acts: for he cast devils out of the Jews, who said
that He Himself was possessed by a devil, He bestowed benefits on
His persecutors, He fed those who were forming designs against Him,
He conducted into His kingdom those who were desiring to crucify
Him. Again He said to His disciples “Get you no gold nor silver

this also He taught by His example, thus saying, “Foxes have

not where to lay His head.”<note place="end" n="692" id="xi.ii-p74.2"><p class="endnote" id="xi.ii-p75"> <scripRef passage="Matt. viii. 20" id="xi.ii-p75.1" parsed="|Matt|8|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.8.20">Matt.

dwelling nor anything else of that kind: not because He was at a
loss to obtain them, but because He was instructing men to go in
that path. After the same manner then he taught them also to pray.
They said to Him “Teach us to pray.”<note place="end" n="693" id="xi.ii-p75.2"><p class="endnote" id="xi.ii-p76"> <scripRef passage="Luke xi. 1" id="xi.ii-p76.1" parsed="|Luke|11|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.11.1">Luke xi.
1</scripRef>.</p></note> Therefore also He prays, in order
that they may learn to pray. But it was necessary for them not
merely to learn to pray but also how they ought to pray: for this
reason He delivered to them a prayer in this form: “Our Father
which art in Heaven hallowed be thy name, Thy kingdom come: Thy
will be done, as in Heaven, so on earth. Give us this day our daily
bread: and forgive us our debts as we also forgive our debtors: and
lead us not into temptation:”<note place="end" n="694" id="xi.ii-p76.2"><p class="endnote" id="xi.ii-p77"> <scripRef passage="Luke xi. 2-4" id="xi.ii-p77.1" parsed="|Luke|11|2|11|4" osisRef="Bible:Luke.11.2-Luke.11.4">Luke xi.
2–4</scripRef>.</p></note> that is into danger, into snares.
Since then He commanded them to pray “lead us not into
temptation,” He instructs them in this very precept by putting it
in practice Himself, saying “Father if it be possible, let this
cup pass away from me,” thus teaching all the saints not to
plunge into dangers, not to fling themselves into them but to wait
for their approach, and to exhibit all possible courage, only not
to rush forwards themselves, or to be the first to advance against
terrors. Why so, pray? both to teach us lowliness of mind, and also
to deliver us from the charge of vainglory. On this account it is
said also in this passage that when He had spoken these words “He
went away and prayed:” and after He had prayed He speaks thus to
His disciples “Could ye not watch with me one hour? Watch and
pray that ye enter not into temptation.”<note place="end" n="695" id="xi.ii-p77.2"><p class="endnote" id="xi.ii-p78"> <scripRef passage="Matt. xxvi. 39-41" id="xi.ii-p78.1" parsed="|Matt|26|39|26|41" osisRef="Bible:Matt.26.39-Matt.26.41">Matt.

also admonishes? “For the Spirit indeed is willing,” He said,
“but the flesh is weak.”<note place="end" n="696" id="xi.ii-p78.2"><p class="endnote" id="xi.ii-p79"> <scripRef passage="Matt. xxvi. 41" id="xi.ii-p79.1" parsed="|Matt|26|41|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.26.41">Matt.

their soul of vanity, and delivering them from pride, teaching them
self-restraint, training them to practice moderation. Therefore the
prayer which He wished to teach them, He Himself also offered,
speaking after the manner of men, not according to His Godhead (for
the divine nature is impassable) but according to His manhood. And
He prayed as instructing us to pray, and even to seek deliverance
from distress; but, if this be not permitted, then to acquiesce in
what seems good to God. Therefore He said “Nevertheless not as I
will but as Thou wilt:” not because He had one will and the
Father another; but in order that He might instruct men even if
they were in distress and trembling, even if danger came upon them,
and they were unwilling to be torn from present life, nevertheless
to postpone their own will to the will of God: even as Paul also
when he had been instructed practically exhibited both these
principles; for he besought that temptations might be removed from
him, thus saying “For this thing I besought the Lord thrice:”<note place="end" n="697" id="xi.ii-p79.2"><p class="endnote" id="xi.ii-p80"> <scripRef passage="2 Cor. xii. 8" id="xi.ii-p80.1" parsed="|2Cor|12|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.12.8">2 Cor.

since it <pb n="207" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_207.html" id="xi.ii-Page_207" />did not

quite clear: therefore I will make it clearer. Paul incurred many
dangers and prayed that he might not be exposed to them. Then he
heard Christ saying “my grace is sufficient for thee, for my
strength is made perfect in weakness.”<note place="end" n="699" id="xi.ii-p81.2"><p class="endnote" id="xi.ii-p82"> <scripRef passage="2 Cor. xii. 9" id="xi.ii-p82.1" parsed="|2Cor|12|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.12.9">2 Cor.

will of God was, he in future submitted his will to God’s will.
By means of this prayer then Christ taught both these truths, that
we should not plunge into dangers, but rather pray that we may not
fall into them; but if they come upon us we should bear them
bravely, and postpone our own will to the will of God. Knowing
these things then let us pray that we may never enter into
temptation: but if we do enter it let us beseech God to give us
patience and courage, and let us honour His will in preference to
every will of our own. For then we shall pass through this present
life with safety, and shall obtain the blessings to come: which may
we all receive by the favour and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus
Christ, with Whom be to the Father, together with the Holy Ghost,
glory, might, honour, now and for ever world without end.
Amen.</p>

<p class="c9" id="xii.ii-p3">1. <span class="c12" id="xii.ii-p3.1">Having</span> lately come
across the incident of the paralytic <note place="end" n="700" id="xii.ii-p3.2"><p class="endnote" id="xii.ii-p4"> The allusion is most probably to Homily XII.
against the Anomœans, in which Chrysostom proves the equality of
the Divine Son with God the Father by a reference to the cure of
the paralytic by the pool of Bethesda. This Homily against the
Anomœans was delivered at Constantinople, A.D. 398.</p></note> who lay upon his bed beside the
pool, we discovered a rich and large treasure, not by delving in
the ground, but by diving into his heart: we found a treasure not
containing silver and gold and precious stones, but endurance, and
philosophy, and patience and much hope towards God, which is more
valuable than any kind of jewel or source of wealth. For material
riches are liable to the designs of robbers, and the tales of false
accusers, and the violence of housebreakers, and the villany of
servants, and when they have escaped all these things, they often
bring the greatest ruin upon those who possess them by exciting the
eyes of the envious, and consequently breeding countless storms of
trouble. But the spiritual riches escape all these occasions of
mischief and are superior to all abuse of this kind, laughing to
scorn both robbers, and housebreakers, and slanderers, and false
accusers and death itself. For they are not parted from the
possessor by death, but on the contrary the possession becomes then
more especially secured to the owners, and they accompany them on
their journey to the other world, and are transplanted with them to
the future life, and become marvellous advocates of those with whom
they depart hence, and render the judge propitious to
them.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xii.ii-p5">This wealth we found in great abundance stored in
the soul of the paralytic. And you are witnesses who with great
zeal drew up draughts of this treasure yet without exhausting it.
For such is the nature of spiritual wealth; it resembles fountains
of water, or rather exceeds their plenteousness, being most
abundant when it has many to draw upon it. For when it enters into
any man’s soul it is not divided, not diminished, but coming in
its entireness to each remains continually unconsumed, being
incapable of ever failing: which was just what took place at that
time. For although so many have applied to the treasure, and all
are drawing upon it as much as they can—but why do I speak of
you, seeing that it has made countless persons rich from that time
to the present day, and yet abides in its original perfection? Let
us not then grow weary in having recourse to this source of
spiritual wealth: but as far as possible let us now also draw forth
draughts from it, and let us gaze upon our merciful Lord, gaze upon
His patient servant. He had been thirty and eight years struggling
with an incurable infirmity and was perpetually plagued by it, yet
he did not repine, he did not utter a blasphemous word, he did not
accuse his Maker, but endured his calamity bravely and with much
meekness. And whence is this manifest? you say: for Scripture has
not told us anything clearly concerning his former life, but only
that he had been thirty-eight years in his infirmity; it has not
added a word to prove that he did not show discontent, or anger or
petulance. And yet it has made this plain also, if any one will pay
careful attention to it, not looking at it curiously and
carelessly. For when you hear that on the approach of Christ who
was a stranger to him, and regarded merely as a man, he spoke to
him with such great meekness, you may be able to perceive his
former wisdom. For when Jesus said to him “Wilt thou be made
whole?” he did not make the natural reply “thou seest me who
have been this long time lying sick of the palsy, and dost thou ask
<pb n="212" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_212.html" id="xii.ii-Page_212" />me if I wish to be made
whole? hast thou come to insult my distress, to reproach me and
laugh me to scorn and make a mock of my calamity? He did not say or
conceive anything of this kind but meekly replied “Yea Lord.”<note place="end" n="701" id="xii.ii-p5.1"><p class="endnote" id="xii.ii-p6"> We must suppose that Chrysostom considered such
words to be implied in the answer actually given. They are not in
the text of <scripRef passage="John v. 7" id="xii.ii-p6.1" parsed="|John|5|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.5.7">John v. 7</scripRef>, but it seems scarcely
possible that Chrysostom should have forgotten the passage, or that
the quotation should not have been subsequently corrected if he
thought it misleading.</p></note> Now if after
thirty-eight; years he was thus meek and gentle, when all the
vigour and strength of his reasoning faculties was broken down,
consider what he is likely to have been at the outset of his
trouble. For be assured that invalids are not so hard to please at
the beginning of their disorder, as they are after a long lapse of
time: they become most intractable, most intolerable to all, when
the malady is prolonged. But as he, after so many years, was so
wise, and replied with so much forbearance, it is quite clear that
during the previous time also he had been bearing that calamity
with much thankfulness.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xii.ii-p7">Considering these things then let us imitate the
patience of our fellow-servant: for his paralysis is sufficient to
brace up our souls: for no one can be so supine and indolent after
having observed the magnitude of that calamity as not to endure
bravely all evils which may befall him, even if they are more
intolerable than all that were ever known. For not only his
soundness but also his sickness has become a cause of the greatest
benefit to us: for his cure has stimulated the souls of the hearers
to speak the praise of the Lord, and his sickness and infirmity has
encouraged you to patience, and urged you to match his zeal; or
rather it has exhibited to you the lovingkindness of God. For the
actual deliverance of the man to such a malady, and the protracted
duration of his infirmity is a sign of the greatest care for his
welfare. For as a gold refiner having cast a piece of gold into the
furnace suffers it to be proved by the fire until such time as he
sees it has become purer: even so God permits the souls of men to
be tested by troubles until they become pure and transparent and
have reaped much profit from this process of sifting: wherefore
this is the greatest species of benefit.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xii.ii-p8">2. Let us not then be disturbed, neither dismayed,
when trials befall us. For if the gold refiner sees how long he
ought to leave the piece of gold in the furnace, and when he ought
to draw it out, and does not allow it to remain in the fire until
it is destroyed and burnt up: much more does God understand this,
and when He sees that we have become more pure, He releases us from
our trials so that we may not be overthrown and cast down by the
multiplication of our evils. Let us then not be repining, or
faint-hearted, when some unexpected thing befalls us; but let us
suffer Him who knows these things accurately, to prove our hearts
by fire as long as He pleases: for He does this for a useful
purpose and with a view to the profit of those who are tried.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xii.ii-p9">On this account a certain wise man admonishes
us saying “My Son, if thou come to serve the Lord prepare thy
soul for temptation, set thy heart aright and constantly endure and
make not haste in time of trouble;”<note place="end" n="702" id="xii.ii-p9.1"><p class="endnote" id="xii.ii-p10"> <scripRef passage="Ecclesiasticus 1.1,2" id="xii.ii-p10.1" parsed="|Sir|1|1|1|2" osisRef="Bible:Sir.1.1-Sir.1.2">Ecclus. i. 1, 2</scripRef>.</p></note> “yield to Him” he says, “in
all things,” for He knoweth exactly when it is right to pluck us
out of the furnace of evil. We ought therefore everywhere to yield
to Him and always to give thanks, and to bear all things
contentedly, whether He bestows benefits or chastisement upon us,
for this also is a species of benefit. For the physician, not only
when he bathes and nourishes the patient and conducts him into
pleasant gardens, but also when he uses cautery and the knife, is a
physician all the same: and a father not only when he caresses his
son, but also when he expels him from his house, and when he chides
and scourges him, is a father all the same, no less than when he
praises him. Knowing therefore that God is more tenderly loving
than all physicians, do not enquire too curiously concerning His
treatment nor demand an account of it from Him, but whether He is
pleased to let us go free or whether He punishes, let us offer
ourselves for either alike; for He seeks by means of each to lead
us back to health, and to communion with Himself, and He knows our
several needs, and what is expedient for each one, and how and in
what manner we ought to be saved, and along that path He leads us.
Let us then follow whithersoever He bids us, and let us not too
carefully consider whether He commands us to go by a smooth and
easy path, or by a difficult and rugged one: as in the case of this
paralytic. It was one species of benefit indeed that his soul
should be purged by the long duration of his suffering, being
delivered to the fiery trial of affliction as to a kind of furnace;
but it was another benefit no less than this that God was present
with him in the midst of the trials, and afforded him great
consolation. He it was who strengthened him, and upheld him, and
stretched forth a hand to him, and suffered him not to fall. But
when you hear that it was God Himself do not deprive the paralytic
of his meed of praise, neither him nor any other man who is tried
and yet steadfastly endures. For even if we be infinitely wise,
even if we are mightier and stronger than all men, yet in the
absence of His grace we shall not 
<pb n="213" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_213.html" id="xii.ii-Page_213" />be able to withstand even the most ordinary
temptation. And why do I speak of such insignificant and abject
beings as we are? For even if one were a Paul, or a Peter, or a
James, or a John, yet if he should be deprived of the divine help
he would easily be put to shame, overthrown, and laid prostrate.
And on behalf of these I will read you the words of Christ Himself:
for He saith to Peter “Behold Satan hath asked to have you that
he may sift you as wheat, but I have prayed for thee that thy faith
fail not.”<note place="end" n="703" id="xii.ii-p10.2"><p class="endnote" id="xii.ii-p11"> <scripRef passage="Luke xxii. 31, 32" id="xii.ii-p11.1" parsed="|Luke|22|31|22|32" osisRef="Bible:Luke.22.31-Luke.22.32">Luke xxii.
31, 32</scripRef>.</p></note> What is the
meaning of “sift”? to turn and twist, and shake and stir and
shatter, and worry, which is what takes place in the case of things
which are winnowed: but I he says have restrained him, knowing that
you are not able to endure the trial, for the expression “that
thy faith fail not” is the utterance of one who signifies that if
he had permitted it his faith would have failed. Now if Peter who
was such a fervent lover of Christ and exposed his life for Him
countless times and sprang into the foremost rank in the Apostolic
band, and was pronounced blessed by his Master, and called Peter on
this account because he kept a firm and inflexible hold of the
faith, would have been carried away and fallen from profession if
Christ had permitted the devil to try him as much as he desired,
what other man will be able to stand, apart from His help?
Therefore also Paul saith “But God is faithful, who will not
suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able, but will with the
temptation also make the way of escape that ye may be able to bear
it.”<note place="end" n="704" id="xii.ii-p11.2"><p class="endnote" id="xii.ii-p12"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. x. 13" id="xii.ii-p12.1" parsed="|1Cor|10|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.10.13">1 Cor. x.
13</scripRef>.</p></note> For not only
does He say that He does not suffer a trial to be inflicted beyond
our strength, but even in that which is proportioned to our
strength He is present carrying us through it, and bracing us up,
if only we ourselves first of all contribute the means which are at
our disposal, such as zeal, hope in Him, thanksgiving, endurance,
patience. For not only in the dangers which are beyond our
strength, but in those which are proportioned to it, we need the
divine assistance, if we are to make a brave stand; for elsewhere
also it is said “even as the sufferings of Christ abound to us,
even so our comfort also aboundeth through Christ, that we may be
able to comfort those who are in any trouble, by the comfort
wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.”<note place="end" n="705" id="xii.ii-p12.2"><p class="endnote" id="xii.ii-p13"> <scripRef passage="2 Cor. i. 5, 4" id="xii.ii-p13.1" parsed="|2Cor|1|5|0|0;|2Cor|1|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.1.5 Bible:2Cor.1.4">2 Cor. i.
5, 4</scripRef>. Chrysostom
transposes the clauses, and does not quote the exact words of the
passage.</p></note> So then he who comforted this man
is the same who permitted the trial to be inflicted upon him. And
now observe after the cure what tenderness He displays. For He did
not leave him and depart, but having found him in the temple he
saith “behold! thou art made whole; sin no more lest some worse
thing happen unto thee.”<note place="end" n="706" id="xii.ii-p13.2"><p class="endnote" id="xii.ii-p14"> <scripRef passage="John v. 14" id="xii.ii-p14.1" parsed="|John|5|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.5.14">John v.
14</scripRef>.</p></note> For had He permitted the punishment
because He hated him He would not have released him, He would not
have provided for his future safety: but the expression “lest
some worse thing happen unto thee” is the utterance of one who
would check coming evils beforehand. He put an end to the disease,
but did not put an end to the struggle: He expelled the infirmity
but did not expel the dread of it, so that the benefit which had
been wrought might remain unmoved. This is the part of a
tender-hearted physician, not only to put an end to present pains,
but to provide for future security, which also Christ did, bracing
up his soul by the recollection of past events. For seeing that
when the things which distress us have departed, the recollection
of them oftentimes departs with them, He wishing it to abide
continually, saith “sin no more lest some worse thing happen unto
thee.”</p>

<p class="c10" id="xii.ii-p15">3. Moreover it is possible to discern His
forethought and consideration not only from this, but also from
that which seems to be a rebuke. For He did not make a public
exposure of his sins, but yet He told him that he suffered what he
did suffer on account of his sins, but what those sins were He did
not disclose; nor did He say “thou hast sinned” or “thou hast
transgressed,” but He indicated the fact by one simple utterance
“sin no more;” and having said so much as just to remind him of
it He put him more on the alert against future events, and at the
same time He made manifest to us all his patience and courage and
wisdom, having reduced him to the necessity of publicly lamenting
his calamity, and having displayed his own earnestness on the
man’s behalf, “for while I am coming,” he says, “another
steppeth down before me:”<note place="end" n="707" id="xii.ii-p15.1"><p class="endnote" id="xii.ii-p16"> <scripRef passage="John v. 7" id="xii.ii-p16.1" parsed="|John|5|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.5.7">John v.
7</scripRef>.</p></note> yet he did not publicly expose his
sins. For just as we ourselves desire to draw a veil over our sins
even so does God much more than we: on this account He wrought the
cure in the presence of all, but He gives the exhortation or the
advice privately. For He never makes a public display of our sins,
except at any time He sees men insensible to them. For when He says
“ye saw me hungry, and fed me not: and thirsty and gave me no
drink,”<note place="end" n="708" id="xii.ii-p16.2"><p class="endnote" id="xii.ii-p17"> <scripRef passage="Matt. xxv. 12" id="xii.ii-p17.1" parsed="|Matt|25|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.25.12">Matt. xxv.
12</scripRef>.</p></note> He speaks
thus at the present time in order that we may not hear these words
in time to come. He threatens, He exposes us in this world, that He
may not have to expose us in the other: even as He threatened to
overthrow <pb n="214" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_214.html" id="xii.ii-Page_214" />the city
of the Ninevites<note place="end" n="709" id="xii.ii-p17.2"><p class="endnote" id="xii.ii-p18"> <scripRef passage="Jonah i. 2" id="xii.ii-p18.1" parsed="|Jonah|1|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Jonah.1.2">Jonah i.
2</scripRef>.</p></note> for the very
reason that He might not overthrow it. For if He wished to publish
our sins He would not announce beforehand that He would publish
them: but as it is He does make this announcement in order that
being sobered by the fear of exposure, if not also by the fear of
punishment we may purge ourselves from them all. This also is what
takes place in the case of baptism: for He conducts the man to the
pool of water without disclosing his sins to any one; yet He
publicly presents the boon and makes it manifest to all, while the
sins of the man are known to no one save God Himself and him who
receives the forgiveness of them. This also was what took place in
the case of this paralytic, He makes the reproof without the
presence of witnesses, or rather the utterance is not merely a
reproof but also a justification; He justifies Himself as it were
for evil-entreating him so long, telling him and proving to him
that it was not without cause and purpose that He had suffered him
to be so long afflicted, for He reminded him of his sins, and
declared the cause of his infirmity. “For having found him,” we
read, “in the temple, He said unto him, sin no more lest some
worse thing happen unto thee.”</p>

<p class="c10" id="xii.ii-p19">And now since we have derived so much profit
from the account of the former paralytic let us turn to the other
who is presented to us in St. Matthew’s Gospel. For in the case
of mines where any one happens to find a piece of gold he makes a
further excavation again in the same place: and I know that many of
those who read without care imagine that one and the same paralytic
is presented by the four evangelists: but it is not so. Therefore
you must be on the alert, and pay careful attention to the matter.
For the question is not concerned with ordinary matters, and this
discourse when it has received its proper solution will be
serviceable against both Greeks and Jews and many of the heretics.
For thus all find fault with the evangelists as being at strife and
variance: yet this is not the fact, Heaven forbid! but although the
outward appearance is different, the grace of the Spirit which
works upon the soul of each is one, and where the grace of the
Spirit is, there is love, joy, and peace; and there war and
disputation, strife and contention are not. How then shall we make
it clear that this paralytic is not the same as the other, but a
different man? By many tokens, both of place and time, and season,
and day, and from the manner of the cure, and the coming of the
physician and the loneliness of the man who was healed. And what of
this? some one will say: for have not many of the evangelists given
diverse accounts of other signs? Yes, but it is one thing to make
statements which are diverse, and another, statements which are
contradictory; for the former causes no discord or strife: but that
which is now presented to us is a strong case of contradiction
unless it be proved that the paralytic at the pool was a different
man from him who is described by the other three evangelists. Now
that you may understand what is the difference between statements
which are diverse and contradictory, one of the evangelists has
stated that Christ carried the cross,<note place="end" n="710" id="xii.ii-p19.1"><p class="endnote" id="xii.ii-p20"> <scripRef passage="John xix. 17" id="xii.ii-p20.1" parsed="|John|19|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.19.17">John xix.
17</scripRef>.</p></note> another that Simon the Cyrenian
carried it:<note place="end" n="711" id="xii.ii-p20.2"><p class="endnote" id="xii.ii-p21"> <scripRef passage="Matt. xxvii. 32; Mark xxv. 31; Luke xiii. 26" id="xii.ii-p21.1" parsed="|Matt|27|32|0|0;|Mark|25|31|0|0;|Luke|13|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.27.32 Bible:Mark.25.31 Bible:Luke.13.26">Matt.
xxvii. 32; Mark xxv. 31; Luke xiii. 26</scripRef>.</p></note> but this
causes no contradiction or strife. “And how,” you say, “is
there no contradiction between the statements that he carried and
did not carry?” Because both took place. When they went out of
the Prætorium Christ was carrying it: but as they proceeded Simon
took it from Him and bore it. Again in the case of the robbers, one
says that the two blasphemed:<note place="end" n="712" id="xii.ii-p21.2"><p class="endnote" id="xii.ii-p22"> <scripRef passage="Matt. xxvii. 44; Mark xv. 32" id="xii.ii-p22.1" parsed="|Matt|27|44|0|0;|Mark|15|32|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.27.44 Bible:Mark.15.32">Matt.
xxvii. 44; Mark xv. 32</scripRef>.</p></note> another that one of them checked
him who was reviling the Lord.<note place="end" n="713" id="xii.ii-p22.2"><p class="endnote" id="xii.ii-p23"> <scripRef passage="Luke xxiii. 40" id="xii.ii-p23.1" parsed="|Luke|23|40|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.23.40">Luke
xxiii. 40</scripRef>.</p></note> Yet in this again there is no
contradiction: because here also both things took place, and at the
beginning both the men behaved ill: but afterwards when signs
occurred, when the earth shook and the rocks were rent, and the sun
was darkened, one of them was converted, and became more chastened,
and recognized the crucified one and acknowledged his kingdom. For
to prevent your supposing that this took place by some constraining
force of one impelling him from within, and to remove your
perplexity, he exhibits the man to you on the cross while he is
still retaining his former wickedness in order that you may
perceive that his conversion was effected from within and out of
his own heart assisted by the grace of God and so he became a
better man.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xii.ii-p24">4. And it is possible to collect many other
instances of this kind from the Gospels, which seem to have a
suspicion of contradiction, where there is no real contradiction,
the truth being that some incidents have been related by this
writer, others by that; or if not occurring at the same hour one
author has related the earlier event, another the later; but in the
present case there is nothing of this kind, but the multitude of
the evidences which I have mentioned proves to those who pay any
attention whatever to the matter, that the paralytic was not the
same man in both instances. And this would be no slight proof to
demonstrate that the evangelists were in harmony with each <pb n="215" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_215.html" id="xii.ii-Page_215" />other and not at variance. For if it
were the same man the discord is great between the two accounts:
but if it be a different one all material for dispute has been
destroyed.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xii.ii-p25">Well then let me now state the actual reasons why I
affirm that this man is not the same as that. What are they? The
one is cured in Jerusalem, the other in Capernaum; the one by the
pool of water, the other in some house; there is the evidence from
place: the former during the festival: there is the evidence from
the special season: the former had been thirty and eight years
suffering from infirmity: concerning the other the evangelist
relates nothing of that kind: there is the evidence from time: the
former was cured on the Sabbath: there is the evidence from the
day: for had this man also been cured on the Sabbath Matthew would
not have passed by the fact in silence nor would the Jews who were
present have held their peace: for they who found fault for some
other reason even when a man was not cured on the Sabbath would
have been yet more violent in their accusation against Christ if
they had got an additional handle from the argument of the special
day. Moreover this man was brought to Christ: to the other Christ
Himself came, and there was no man to assist him. “Lord,” said
he, “I have no man:” whereas this man had many who came to his
aid, who also let him down through the roof. And He healed the body
of the other man before his soul: for after he had cured the
paralysis He then said “Behold thou art made whole, sin no
more:” but not so in this case, but after He had healed his soul,
for He said to him “Son be of good cheer thy sins be forgiven
thee,” He then cured his paralysis. That this man then is not the
same as the other has been clearly demonstrated by these proofs,
but it now remains for us to turn to the beginning of the narrative
and see how Christ cured the one and the other, and why differently
in each case: why the one on the Sabbath and the other not on the
Sabbath, why He came Himself to the one but waited for the other to
be brought to Him, why He healed the body of the one and the soul
of the other first. For He does not these things without
consideration and purpose seeing that He is wise and prudent. Let
us then give our attention and observe Him as He performs the cure.
For if in the case of physicians when they use the knife or cautery
or operate in any other way upon a maimed and crippled patient, and
cut off a limb, many persons crowd round the invalid and the
physician who is doing these things, much more ought we to act thus
in this case, in proportion as the physician is greater and the
malady more severe, being one which cannot be corrected by human
art, but only by divine grace. And in the former case we have to
see the skin being cut, and matter discharging, and gore set in
motion, and to endure much discomfort produced by the spectacle,
and great pain and sorrow not merely from the sight of the wounds,
but also from the suffering undergone by those who are subjected to
this burning or cutting: for no one is so stony-hearted as to stand
by those who are suffering these things, and hear them shrieking,
without being himself overcome and agitated, and experiencing much
depression of spirit; but yet we undergo all this owing to our
desire to witness the operation. But in this case nothing of that
kind has to be seen, no application of fire, no plunging in of an
instrument, no flowing of blood, no pain or shrieking of the
patient; and the reason of this is, the wisdom of the healer, which
needs none of these external aids, but is absolutely
self-sufficient. For it is enough that He merely utters a command
and all distress ceases. And the wonder is not only that He effects
the cure with so much ease, but also without pain, causing no
trouble to those who are being healed.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xii.ii-p26">Seeing then that the marvel is greater and the
cure more important, and the pleasure afforded to the spectators
unalloyed by any kind of sorrow, let us now carefully contemplate
Christ in the act of healing. “And He entered into a boat and
crossed over and came into His own city: and behold they brought to
him a man sick of the palsy lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing their
faith said unto the sick of the palsy “Son! be of good cheer: thy
sins are forgiven.”<note place="end" n="714" id="xii.ii-p26.1"><p class="endnote" id="xii.ii-p27"> <scripRef passage="Matt. ix. 1, 2" id="xii.ii-p27.1" parsed="|Matt|9|1|9|2" osisRef="Bible:Matt.9.1-Matt.9.2">Matt. ix.
1, 2</scripRef>.</p></note> Now they were inferior to the
centurion in respect of their faith, but superior to the impotent
man by the pool. For the former neither invited the physician nor
brought the sick man to the physician; but approached Him as God
and said “Speak the word only and my servant shall be
healed.”<note place="end" n="715" id="xii.ii-p27.2"><p class="endnote" id="xii.ii-p28"> <scripRef passage="Luke vii. 7" id="xii.ii-p28.1" parsed="|Luke|7|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.7.7">Luke vii.
7</scripRef>.</p></note> Now these
men did not invite the physician to the house, and so far they are
on an equality with the centurion: but they brought the sick man to
the physician and so far they are inferior, because they did not
say “speak the word only.” Yet they are far better than the man
lying by the pool. For he said “Lord I have no man when the water
is troubled to put me into the pool:” but these men knew that
Christ had no need either of water, or pool, or anything else of
that kind: nevertheless Christ not only released the servant of the
centurion but the other two men also from their maladies, and did
not say: “because thou hast proffered 
<pb n="216" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_216.html" id="xii.ii-Page_216" />a smaller degree of faith the cure which
thou receivest shall be in proportion;” but He dismissed the man
who displayed the greater faith with eulogy and honour, saying “I
have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.”<note place="end" n="716" id="xii.ii-p28.2"><p class="endnote" id="xii.ii-p29"> <scripRef passage="Luke vii. 9" id="xii.ii-p29.1" parsed="|Luke|7|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.7.9">Luke vii.
9</scripRef>.</p></note> On the man
who exhibited less faith than this one he bestowed no praise yet He
did not deprive him of a cure, no! not even him who displayed no
faith at all. But just as physicians when curing the same disorder
receive from some person a hundred gold pieces, from others half,
from others less and from some nothing at all: even so Christ
received from the centurion a large and unspeakable degree of
faith, but from this man less and from the other not even an
ordinary amount, and yet He healed them all. For what reason then
did He deem the man who made no deposit of faith worthy of the
benefit? Because his failure to exhibit faith was not owing to
indolence, or to insensibility of soul, but to ignorance of Christ
and having never heard any miracle in which He was concerned either
small or great. On this account therefore the man obtained
indulgence: which in fact the evangelist obscurely intimates when
he says, “for he wist not who it was,”<note place="end" n="717" id="xii.ii-p29.2"><p class="endnote" id="xii.ii-p30"> <scripRef passage="John v. 13" id="xii.ii-p30.1" parsed="|John|5|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.5.13">John v.
13</scripRef>.</p></note> but he only recognized Him by sight
when he lighted upon Him the second time.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xii.ii-p31">5. There are indeed some who say that this man
was healed merely because they who brought him believed; but this
is not the fact. For “when He saw their faith” refers not
merely to those who brought the man but also to the man who was
brought. Why so? “Is not one man healed,” you say, “because
another has believed?” For my part I do not think so unless owing
to immaturity of age or excessive infirmity he is in some way
incapable of believing. How then was it you say that in the case of
the woman of Canaan the mother believed but the daughter was cured?
and how was it that the servant of the centurion who believed rose
from the bed of sickness and was preserved. Because the sick
persons themselves were not able to believe. Hear then what the
woman of Canaan says: “My daughter is grievously vexed with a
devil<note place="end" n="718" id="xii.ii-p31.1"><p class="endnote" id="xii.ii-p32"> <scripRef passage="Matt. xv. 22" id="xii.ii-p32.1" parsed="|Matt|15|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.15.22">Matt. xv.

sometimes she falleth into the water and sometimes into the
fire:”<note place="end" n="719" id="xii.ii-p32.2"><p class="endnote" id="xii.ii-p33"> These words occur in the description of the lunatic

memory, confuses the two narratives.</p></note> now how
could she believe whose mind was darkened and possessed by a devil,
and was never able to control herself, not in her sound senses? As
then in the case of the woman of Canaan so also in the case of the
centurion; his servant lay ill in the house, not knowing Christ,
himself, nor who He was. How then was he to believe in one who was
unknown to him, and of whom he had never yet obtained any
experience? But in the case before us we cannot say this: for the
paralytic believed. Whence is this manifest? From the very manner
of his approach to Christ. For do not attend simply to the
statement that they let the man down through the roof: but consider
how great a matter it is for a sick man to have the fortitude to
undergo this. For you are surely aware that invalids are so
faint-hearted and difficult to please as often to decline the
treatment administered to them on their sick bed, and to prefer
bearing the pain which arises from their maladies to undergoing the
annoyance caused by the remedies. But this man had the fortitude to
go outside the house, and to be carried into the midst of the
market place, and to exhibit himself in the presence of a crowd.
And it is the habit of sick folk to die under their disorder rather
than disclose their personal calamities. This sick man however did
not act thus, but when he saw that the place of assembly was
filled, the approaches blocked, the haven of refuge obstructed, he
submitted to be let down through the roof. So ready in contrivance
is desire, so rich in resource is love. “For he also that seeketh
findeth, and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.”<note place="end" n="720" id="xii.ii-p33.2"><p class="endnote" id="xii.ii-p34"> <scripRef passage="Luke xi. 10" id="xii.ii-p34.1" parsed="|Luke|11|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.11.10">Luke xi.
10</scripRef>.</p></note> The man did
not say to his friends “What is the meaning of this? why make
this ado? why push on? Let us wait until the house is cleared and
the assembly is dissolved: the crowds will withdraw, we shall then
be able to approach him privately and confer about these matters.
Why should you expose my misfortunes in the midst of all the
spectators, and let me down from the roof-top, and behave in an
unseemly manner?” That man said none of these things either to
himself or to his bearers, but regarded it as an honour to have so
many persons made witnesses of his cure. And not from this
circumstance only was it possible to discern his faith but also
from the actual words of Christ. For after he had been let down and
presented Christ said to him, “Son! be of good cheer, thy sins
are forgiven thee.” And when he heard these words he was not
indignant, he did not complain, he did not say to the physician
“What mean you by this? I came to be healed of one thing and you
heal another. This is an excuse and a pretence and a screen of
incompetence. Do you forgive sins which are invisible?” He
neither spoke nor thought any of these things, but waited, allowing
the physician to adopt the method of healing which He desired. For
this reason also Christ did not go to him, but <pb n="217" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_217.html" id="xii.ii-Page_217" />waited for him to come, that He
might exhibit his faith to all. For could He not have made the
entrance easy? But He did none of these things; in order that He
might exhibit the man’s zeal and fervent faith to all. For as He
went to the man who had been suffering thirty and eight years
because he had no one to aid him, so did He wait for this man to
come to him because he had many friends that He might make his
faith manifest by the man being brought to Him, and inform us of
the other man’s loneliness by going to him, and disclose the
earnestness of the one and the patience of the other to all and
especially to those who were present. For some envious and
misanthropical Jews were accustomed to grudge the benefits done to
their neighbours and to find fault with His miracles, sometimes on
account of the special season, saying that He healed on the sabbath
day; sometimes on account of the life of those to whom the benefit
was done, saying “if this man were a prophet He would have known
who the woman was who touched Him:”<note place="end" n="721" id="xii.ii-p34.2"><p class="endnote" id="xii.ii-p35"> <scripRef passage="Luke vii. 39" id="xii.ii-p35.1" parsed="|Luke|7|39|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.7.39">Luke vii.
39</scripRef>.</p></note> not knowing that it is the special
mark of a physician to associate with the infirm and to be
constantly seen by the side of the sick, not to avoid them, or
hurry from their presence—which in fact was what He expressly
said to those murmurers; “They that are whole have no need of a
physician but they that are sick.”<note place="end" n="722" id="xii.ii-p35.2"><p class="endnote" id="xii.ii-p36"> <scripRef passage="Matt. ix. 12" id="xii.ii-p36.1" parsed="|Matt|9|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.9.12">Matt. ix.
12</scripRef>.</p></note> Therefore in order to prevent their
making the same accusations again He proves first of all that they
who come to Him are deserving of a cure on account of the faith
which they exhibit. For this reason He exhibited the loneliness of
one man, and the fervent faith and zeal of the other: for this
reason He healed the one on the Sabbath, the other not on the
Sabbath: in order that when you see them accusing and rebuking
Christ on another day you may understand that they accused him on
the former occasion also not because of their respect for the law,
but because they could not contain their own malice. But why did He
not first address Himself to the cure of the paralytic, but said,
“Son! be of good cheer, thy sins are forgiven thee?” He did
this very wisely. For it is a habit with physicians to destroy the
originating cause of the malady before they remove the malady
itself. Often for example when the eyes are distressed by some evil
humour and corrupt discharge, the physician, abandoning any
treatment of the disordered vision, turns his attention to the
head, where the root and origin of the infirmity is: even so did
Christ act: He represses first of all the source of the evil. For
the source and root and mother of all evil is the nature of sin.
This it is which enervates our bodies: this it is which brings on
disease: therefore also on this occasion He said, “Son! be of
good cheer, thy sins are forgiven thee.” And on the other He
said, “Behold! thou art made whole, sin no more lest some worse
thing happen unto thee,” intimating to both that these maladies
were the offspring of sin. And in the beginning and outset of the
word disease as the consequence of sin attacked the body of Cain.
For after the murder of his brother, after that act of wickedness,
his body was subject to palsy.<note place="end" n="723" id="xii.ii-p36.2"><p class="endnote" id="xii.ii-p37"> The allusion is to 
<scripRef passage="Gen. iv. 12" id="xii.ii-p37.1" parsed="|Gen|4|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.4.12">Gen. iv. 12</scripRef>, where the words rendered in
the English translation “a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou
be” are in the LXX. rendered στ™νων καὶ
τρ™μων žσῃ, “groaning and trembling shalt thou be:”
but our English version is the more correct.</p></note> For trembling is the same thing as
palsy. For when the strength which regulates a living creature
becomes weakened, being no longer able to support all the limbs, it
deprives them of their natural power of direction, and then having
become unstrung they tremble and turn giddy.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xii.ii-p38">6. Paul also demonstrated this: for when he
was reproaching the Corinthians with a certain sin he said, “For
this cause many are weak and sickly among you.” Therefore also
Christ first removes the cause of the evil, and having said “Son!
be of good cheer, thy sins are forgiven thee,” He uplifts the
spirit and rouses the downcast soul: for the speech became an
efficient cause and having entered into the conscience it laid hold
of the soul itself and cast out of it all distress. For nothing
creates pleasure and affords confidence so much as freedom from
self-reproach. For where remission of sins is there is sonship.
Even so at least we are not able to call God Father until we have
washed away our sins in the pool of the sacred water. It is when we
have come up from thence, having put off that evil load, that we
say “Our Father which art in Heaven.” But in the case of the
man who was infirm thirty and eight years why did He not act thus,
but cured his body first of all? Because by that long period of
time his sins had been exhausted: for the magnitude of a trial can
lighten the load of sins; as indeed we read was the case with
Lazarus, that he received his evil things in full, and thereupon
was comforted: and again in another place we read, “Comfort ye my
people, say ye to the heart of Jerusalem, that she hath received of
the Lord’s hand double for her sins.”<note place="end" n="724" id="xii.ii-p38.1"><p class="endnote" id="xii.ii-p39"> <scripRef passage="Isa. xl. 1, 2" id="xii.ii-p39.1" parsed="|Isa|40|1|40|2" osisRef="Bible:Isa.40.1-Isa.40.2">Isa. xl.

12</scripRef>.</p></note> indicating
that penalties and punishments work forgiveness of sins; and this
we might prove 
<pb n="218" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_218.html" id="xii.ii-Page_218" />from many passages. It seems to me then
that the reason why He said nothing to that man about remission of
sins, but only secured him against the future, was because the
penalty for his sins had been already worked out by the long
duration of his sickness: or if this was not the reason, it was
because he had not yet attained any high degree of belief
concerning Christ that the Lord first addressed Himself to the
lesser need, and one which was manifest and obvious, the health of
the body; but in the case of the other man He did not act thus, but
inasmuch as this man had more faith, and a loftier soul, He spoke
to him first of all concerning the more dangerous disease: with the
additional object of exhibiting his equality of rank with the
Father. For just as in the former case He healed on the Sabbath day
because He wished to lead men away from the Jewish mode of
observing it, and to take occasion from their reproaches to prove
Himself equal with the Father: even so in this instance also,
knowing beforehand what they were going to say, He uttered these
words that He might use them as a starting-point and a pretext for
proving His equality of rank with the Father. For it is one thing
when no one brings an accusation or charge to enter spontaneously
upon a discourse about these things, and quite another when other
persons give occasion for it, to set about the same work in the
order and shape of a defence. For the nature of the former
demonstration was a stumbling block to the hearers: but the other
was less offensive, and more acceptable, and everywhere we see Him
doing this, and manifesting His equality not so much by words as by
deeds. This at any rate is what the Evangelist implied when he said
that the Jews persecuted Jesus not only because He broke the
Sabbath but also because He said that God was His Father, making
Himself equal with God,<note place="end" n="726" id="xii.ii-p40.2"><p class="endnote" id="xii.ii-p41"> <scripRef passage="John v. 16" id="xii.ii-p41.1" parsed="|John|5|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.5.16">John v.
16</scripRef>.</p></note> which is a far greater thing, for
He effected this by the demonstration of His deeds. How then do the
envious and wicked act, and those who seek to find a handle in
every direction? “Why does this man blaspheme?” they say for
“no man can forgive sins save God alone.”<note place="end" n="727" id="xii.ii-p41.2"><p class="endnote" id="xii.ii-p42"> <scripRef passage="Mark ii. 7" id="xii.ii-p42.1" parsed="|Mark|2|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Mark.2.7">Mark ii.
7</scripRef>.</p></note> As they persecuted Him there
because He broke the Sabbath, and took occasion from their
reproaches to declare His equality with the Father in the form of a
defence, saying “my Father worketh hitherto and I work,”<note place="end" n="728" id="xii.ii-p42.2"><p class="endnote" id="xii.ii-p43"> <scripRef passage="John v. 17" id="xii.ii-p43.1" parsed="|John|5|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.5.17">John v.
17</scripRef>.</p></note> so here also
starting from the accusations which they make He proves from these
His exact likeness to the Father. For what was it they said? “No
man can forgive sins save God alone.” Inasmuch then as they
themselves laid down this definition, they themselves introduced
the rule, they themselves declared the law, He proceeds to entangle
them by means of their own words. “You have confessed,” He
says, “that forgiveness of sins is an attribute of God alone: my
equality therefore is unquestionable.” And it is not these men
only who declare this but also the prophet thus saying: “who is
God as thou?” and then, indicating His special attribute he adds
“taking away iniquity and passing over unrighteousness.”<note place="end" n="729" id="xii.ii-p43.2"><p class="endnote" id="xii.ii-p44"> <scripRef passage="Micah vii. 18" id="xii.ii-p44.1" parsed="|Mic|7|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Mic.7.18">Micah vii.
18</scripRef>.</p></note> If then any
one else appears thus doing the same thing He also is God, God even
as that one is God. But let us observe how Christ argues with them,
how meekly and gently, and with all tenderness. “And behold some
of the scribes said within themselves: this man blasphemeth.”
They did not utter the word, they did not proclaim it through the
tongue, but reasoned in the secret recesses of their heart. How
then did Christ act? He made public their secret thoughts before
the demonstration which was concerned with the cure of the
paralytic’s body, wishing to prove to them the power of His
Godhead. For that it is an attribute of God alone, a sign of His
deity to shew the secrets of His mind, the Scripture saith “Thou
alone knowest men’s hearts.”<note place="end" n="730" id="xii.ii-p44.2"><p class="endnote" id="xii.ii-p45"> <scripRef passage="1 Kings viii. 39" id="xii.ii-p45.1" parsed="|1Kgs|8|39|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Kgs.8.39">1 Kings
viii. 39</scripRef>.</p></note> Seest thou that this word
“alone,” is not used with a view of contrasting the Son with
the Father. For if the Father alone knows the heart, how does the
Son know the secrets of the mind? “For He Himself” it is said,
“knew what was in man;”<note place="end" n="731" id="xii.ii-p45.2"><p class="endnote" id="xii.ii-p46"> <scripRef passage="John ii. 25" id="xii.ii-p46.1" parsed="|John|2|25|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.2.25">John ii.
25</scripRef>.</p></note> and Paul when proving that the
knowledge of secret things is a special attribute of God says,
“and He that searchest the heart,”<note place="end" n="732" id="xii.ii-p46.2"><p class="endnote" id="xii.ii-p47"> <scripRef passage="Rom. viii. 27" id="xii.ii-p47.1" parsed="|Rom|8|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.8.27">Rom. viii.
27</scripRef>.</p></note> shewing that this expression is
equivalent to the appellation “God.” For just as when I say
“He who causeth rain said,” I signify none other than God by
mentioning the deed, since it is one which belongs to Him alone:
and when I say “He who maketh the sun to rise,” without adding
the word God, I yet signify Him by mentioning the deed: even so
when Paul said “He who searcheth the hearts,” he proved that to
search the heart is an attribute of God alone. For if this
expression had not been of equal force with the name “God” for
pointing out Him who was signified, he would not have used it
absolutely and by itself. For if the power were shared by Him in
common with some created being, we should not have known who was
signified, the community of power causing confusion in the mind of
the hearers. Inasmuch then as this appears to be a special
attribute of the Father, and yet is manifested of the Son whose
equal<pb n="219" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_219.html" id="xii.ii-Page_219" />ity becomes thence
unquestionable, therefore we read “why think ye evil in your
hearts? for whether is easier: to say: Thy sins are forgiven thee
or to say arise and walk?”</p>

<p class="c10" id="xii.ii-p48">7. See moreover He makes a second proof of His power
of forgiving sins. For to forgive sins is a very much greater act
than to heal the body, greater in proportion as the soul is greater
than the body. For as paralysis is a disease of the body, even so
sin is a disease of the soul: but although this is the greater it
is not palpable: whereas the other although it be less is manifest.
Since then He is about to use the less for a demonstration of the
greater proving that He acted thus on account of their weakness,
and by way of condescension to their feeble condition He says
“whether is easier? to say thy sins are forgiven thee or to say
arise and walk?” For what reason then should He address Himself
to the lesser act on their account? Because that which is manifest
presents the proof in a more distinct form. Therefore He did not
enable the man to rise until He had said to them “But that ye may
know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (then
saith He to the sick of the palsy) arise and walk:” as if He had
said: forgiveness of sins is indeed a greater sign: but for your
sakes I add the less also since this seems to you to be a proof of
the other. For as in another case when He praised the centurion for
saying “speak the word only and my servant shall be healed: for I
also say to this man go and he goeth and to the other come and he
cometh,” He confirmed his opinion by the eulogy which He
pronounced: and again when He reproved the Jews for finding fault
with Him on the Sabbath day saying that He transgressed the law, He
proved that He had authority to alter laws: even so in this
instance also when some said “He maketh Himself equal with God by
promising that which belongs only to the Father,” He having
upbraided and accused them and proved by His deeds that He did not
blaspheme supplied us with indisputable evidence that He could do
the same things as the Father who begat Him. Observe at least the
manner in which He pleases to establish the fact that what belongs
to the Father only, belongs also to Himself: for He did not simply
enable the paralytic to get up, but also said “but that ye may
know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins:”
thus it was his endeavour and earnest desire to prove above all
things that He had the same authority as the Father.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xii.ii-p49">8. Let us then carefully hold fast all these
things, both those which were spoken yesterday and the day before
that, and let us beseech God that they may abide immoveably in our
heart, and let us contribute zeal on our side, and constantly meet
in this place. For in this way we shall preserve the truths which
have been formerly spoken, and we shall add others to our store;
and if any of them slip from our memory through the lapse of time
we shall easily be able to recover them by the aid of continual
teaching. And not only will the doctrines abide sound and uncorrupt
but our course of life will have the benefit of much diligent care
and we shall be able to pass through this present state of
existence with pleasure and cheerfulness. For whatever kind of
suffering is oppressing our soul when we come here will easily be
got rid of: seeing that now also Christ is present, and he who
approaches Him with faith will readily receive healing from Him.
Suppose some one is struggling with perpetual poverty, and at a
loss for necessary food, and often goes to bed hungry, if he has
come in here, and heard Paul saying that he passed his time in
hunger and thirst and nakedness, and that he experienced this not
on one or two or three days, but constantly (this at least is what
he indicates when he says “up to the present hour we both hunger
and thirst and are naked”),<note place="end" n="733" id="xii.ii-p49.1"><p class="endnote" id="xii.ii-p50"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. iv. 11" id="xii.ii-p50.1" parsed="|1Cor|4|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.4.11">1 Cor. iv.

learning by means of these words that God has not permitted him to
be in poverty because He hated him or abandoned him: for if this
were the effect of hatred, He would not have permitted it in the
case of Paul who was of all men especially dear to Him: but He
permitted it out of His tender love and providential care, and by
way of conducting him to a higher degree of spiritual wisdom. Has
some other man a body which is beset with disease and countless
sufferings? The condition of these paralytics may be an ample
source of consolation and besides these the blessed and brave
disciple of Paul who was continually suffering from disorders, and
never had any respite from prolonged infirmity, even as Paul also
said “Use a little wine for thy stomach’s sake and thine often
infirmities,”<note place="end" n="734" id="xii.ii-p50.2"><p class="endnote" id="xii.ii-p51"> <scripRef passage="1 Tim. v. 23" id="xii.ii-p51.1" parsed="|1Tim|5|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.5.23">1 Tim. v.

does not speak merely of infirmities as such. Or another having
been subjected to false accusation has acquired a bad reputation

lay aside all despondency and receive every kind of pleasure: for
it is written “leap for joy, and

<p class="c10" id="xii.ii-p55">Another perhaps has lost a little daughter or
a son, or one of his kinsfolk, and he also having come here listens
to Paul groaning over this present life and longing to see that
which is to come, and oppressed by his sojourn in this world, and
he will go away with a sufficient remedy for his grief when he has
heard him say “Now concerning them that are asleep I would not
have you ignorant brethren that ye sorrow not even as others who
have no hope.”<note place="end" n="738" id="xii.ii-p55.1"><p class="endnote" id="xii.ii-p56"> <scripRef passage="1 Thess. iv. 13" id="xii.ii-p56.1" parsed="|1Thess|4|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Thess.4.13">1 Thess.

say concerning the dying, but “concerning them that are asleep”
proving that death is a sleep. As then if we see any one sleeping
we are not disturbed or distressed, expecting that he will
certainly get up: even so when we see any one dead, let us not be
disturbed or dejected for this also is a sleep, a longer one
indeed, but still a sleep. By giving it the name of slumber He
comforted the mourners and overthrew the accusation of the
unbelievers. If you mourn immoderately over him who has departed
you will be like that unbeliever who has no hope of a resurrection.
He indeed does well to mourn, inasmuch as he cannot exercise any
spiritual wisdom concerning things to come: but thou who hast
received such strong proofs concerning the future life, why dost
thou sink into the same weakness with him? Therefore it is written
“now concerning them that are asleep we would not have you
ignorant that ye sorrow not even as others who have no
hope.”</p>

<p class="c10" id="xii.ii-p57">And not only from the New Testament but from
the Old also it is possible to receive abundant consolation. For
when you hear of Job after the loss of his property, after the
destruction of his herds, after the loss not of one, or two, or
three, but of a whole troop of sons in the very flower of their
age, after the great excellence of soul which he displayed, even if
thou art the weakest of men, thou wilt easily be able to repent and
regain thy courage. For thou, O man, hast constantly attended thy
sick son, and hast seen him laid upon the bed, and hast heard him
uttering his last words, and stood beside him whilst he was drawing
his last breath and hast closed his eyes, and shut his mouth: but
he was not present at the death struggle of his sons, he did not
see them breathing their last gasp, but the house became the common
grave of them all, and on the same table brains and blood were
poured forth, and pieces of wood and tiles, and dust, and fragments
of flesh, and all these things were mingled together in like
manner. Nevertheless after such great calamities of this kind he
was not petulant, but what does he say—“The Lord gave, the Lord
hath taken away; as it seemed good unto the Lord even so has it
come to pass, blessed be the name of the Lord for ever.”<note place="end" n="739" id="xii.ii-p57.1"><p class="endnote" id="xii.ii-p58"> <scripRef passage="Job i. 21" id="xii.ii-p58.1" parsed="|Job|1|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Job.1.21">Job i.
21</scripRef>, LXX. version.</p></note> Let this
speech be our utterance also over each event which befalls us;
whether it be loss of property, or infirmity of body, or insult, or
false accusation or any other form of evil incident to mankind, let
us say these words “The Lord gave, the Lord hath taken away; as
it seemed good to the Lord so has it come to pass; blessed be the
name of the Lord for ever.” If we practise this spiritual wisdom,
we shall never experience any evil, even if we undergo countless
sufferings, but the gain will be greater than the loss, the good
will exceed the evil: by these words thou wilt cause God to be
merciful unto thee, and wilt defend thyself against the tyranny of
Satan. For as soon as thy tongue has uttered these words forthwith
the Devil hastens from thee: and when he has hastened away, the
cloud of dejection also is dispelled and the thoughts which afflict
us take to flight, hurrying off in company with him, and in
addition to all this thou wilt win all manner of blessings both
here and in Heaven. And you have a convincing example in the case
of Job, and of the Apostle, who having for God’s sake despised
the troubles of this world, obtained the everlasting blessings. Let
us then be trustful and in all things which befall us let us
rejoice and give thanks to the merciful God, that we may pass
through this present life with serenity, and obtain the blessings
to come, by the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ
to whom be glory, honour and might always, now and ever, world
without end. Amen.</p>

seems by the prolonged discourse which I lately addressed to you
with a view to kindling your zeal for the assemblies here:<note place="end" n="740" id="xiii.ii-p4.2"><p class="endnote" id="xiii.ii-p5"> The date of this Homily cannot be determined, but
the allusions which it contains to the Imperial palace and guard,
and some other points of internal evidence prove that it was
delivered at Constantinople.</p></note> for again
our Church is destitute of her children. Wherefore also I am again
compelled to seem vexatious and burdensome, reproving those who are
present, and finding fault with those who have been left behind:
with them because they have not put away their sloth, and with you
because you have not given a helping hand to the salvation of your
brethren. I am compelled to seem burdensome and vexatious, not on
behalf of myself, or my own possessions, but on your behalf and for
your salvation, which is more precious to me than anything else.
Let him who pleases take it in bad part, and call me insolent and
impudent, yet will I not cease continually annoying him for the
same purpose; for nothing is better for me than this kind of
impudence. For it may be, it may be, that this at least if nothing
else, will put you to shame, and that to avoid being perpetually
importuned concerning the same things, ye will take part in the
tender care of your brethren. For what profit is there to me in
praise when I do not see you making advances in virtue? and what
harm is there from the silence of the hearers when I behold your
piety increasing? For the praise of the speaker does not consist in
applause, but in the zeal of the hearers for godliness: not in
noise made just at the time of hearing, but in lasting earnestness.
As soon as applause has issued from the lips it is dispersed in air
and perishes; but the moral improvement of the hearers brings an
imperishable and immortal reward both to him who speaks and to them
who obey. The praise of your cheers makes the speaker illustrious
here, but the piety of your soul affords the teacher much
confidence before the judgment-seat of Christ. Wherefore if any one
loves the speaker, let him not desire the applause but the profit
of the hearers. To neglect our brethren is no ordinary wrong, but
one which brings extreme punishment, and an inexorable penalty. And
the case of the man who buried the talent proves this: he was not
reproached at least on account of his own life: for as regarded the
deposit itself he did not turn out a bad man, since he restored it
intact: nevertheless he did turn out a bad man as regarded his
management of the deposit. For he did not double that which was
entrusted to him; and so was punished. Whence it is manifest that
even if we are earnest and well trained, and have much zeal about
hearing the holy scriptures this does not suffice for our
salvation. For the deposit must be doubled, and it becomes doubled
when together with our own salvation we undertake to make some
provision for the good of others. For the man in the parable said
“Lo! there thou hast that is thine:” but this did not serve him
for a defence: for it was said to him “thou oughtest to have put
the money to the exchangers.”<note place="end" n="741" id="xiii.ii-p5.1"><p class="endnote" id="xiii.ii-p6"> <scripRef passage="Matt. xxv. 27" id="xiii.ii-p6.1" parsed="|Matt|25|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.25.27">Matt. xxv.

<p class="c10" id="xiii.ii-p7">And observe I pray how easy the commands of the
Master are: for men indeed make those who lend out capital sums at
interest answera<pb n="224" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_224.html" id="xiii.ii-Page_224" />ble for
recalling them; “you have made the deposit,” one says, “you
must call it in: I have no concern with the man who has received
it.” But God does not act thus; He only commands us to make the
deposit, and does not render us liable for the recall. For the
speaker has the power of advising, not of persuading. Therefore he
says: “I make thee answerable for depositing only, and not for
the recall.” What can be easier than this? And yet the servant
called the master hard, who was thus gentle and merciful. For such
is the wont of the ungrateful and indolent; they always try to
shift the blame of their offences from themselves to their master.
And therefore the man was thrust out with torture and bonds into
the outer darkness. And lest we should suffer this penalty let us
deposit our teaching with the brethren, whether they be persuaded
by it, or not. For if they be persuaded they will profit both
themselves and us: and if they are not, they involve themselves
indeed in inevitable punishment, but will not be able to do us the
slightest injury. For we have done our part, by giving them advice:
but if they do not listen to it no harm will result to us from
that. For blame would attach to us not for failing to persuade, but
for failing to advise: and after prolonged and continual
exhortation and counsel they and not we, have to reckon henceforth
with God.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xiii.ii-p8">I have been anxious at any rate to know clearly,
whether you continue to exhort your brethren, and if they remain
all the time in the same condition of indolence: otherwise I would
never have given you any trouble: as it is, I have fears that they
may remain uncorrected in consequence of your neglect and
indifference. For it is impossible that a man who continually has
the benefit of exhortation and instruction should not become better
and more diligent. The proverb which I am about to cite is
certainly a common one, nevertheless it confirms this very truth.
For “a perpetual dropping of water” it says, “wears a
rock,” yet what is softer than water? and what is harder than a
rock? Nevertheless perpetual action conquers nature: and if it
conquers nature much more will it be able to prevail over the human
will. Christianity is no child’s play, my beloved: no matter of
secondary importance. I am continually saying these things, and yet
I effect nothing.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xiii.ii-p9">2. How am I distressed, think you, when I call
to mind that on the festival days the multitudes assembled resemble
the broad expanse of the sea, but now not even the smallest part of
that multitude is gathered together here? Where are they now who
oppress us with their presence on the feast days? I look for them,
and am grieved on their account when I mark what a multitude are
perishing of those who are in the way of salvation,<note place="end" n="742" id="xiii.ii-p9.1"><p class="endnote" id="xiii.ii-p10"> τῶν σωζομ™νων, this
signifies “members of the Church,” merely, who, as such, are
heirs of salvation, or as the English catechism expresses it, are
in a “state of salvation,” although they may forfeit their

loss of brethren I sustain, how few are reached by the things which
concern salvation, and how the greater part of the body of the
Church is like a dead and motionless carcase. “And what concern
is that to us?” you say. The greatest possible concern if you pay
no attention to your brethren, if you do not exhort and advise, if
you put no constraint on them, and do not forcibly drag them
hither, and lead them away out of their deep indolence. For that
one ought not to be useful to himself alone, but also to many
others, Christ declared plainly, when He called us salt,<note place="end" n="743" id="xiii.ii-p10.2"><p class="endnote" id="xiii.ii-p11"> <scripRef passage="Matt. v. 13" id="xiii.ii-p11.1" parsed="|Matt|5|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.13">Matt. v.

things are useful and profitable to others. For a lamp does not
shine for itself, but for those who are sitting in darkness: and
thou art a lamp not that thou mayest enjoy the light by thyself,
but that thou mayest bring back yonder man who has gone astray. For
what profit is a lamp if it does not give light to him who sits in
darkness? and what profit is a Christian when he benefits no one,
neither leads any one back to virtue? Again salt is not an
astringent to itself but braces up those parts of the body which
have decayed, and prevents them from falling to pieces and
perishing. Even so do thou, since God has appointed thee to be
spiritual salt, bind and brace up the decayed members, that is the
indolent and sordid brethren, and having rescued them from their
indolence as from some form of corruption, unite them to the rest
of the body of the Church. And this is the reason why He called you
leaven: for leaven also does not leaven itself, but, little though
it is, it affects the whole lump however big it may be. So also do
ye: although ye are few in number, yet be ye many and powerful in
faith, and in zeal towards God. As then the leaven is not weak on
account of its littleness, but prevails owing to its inherent heat,
and the force of its natural quality, so ye also will be able to
bring back a far larger number than yourselves, if you will, to the
same degree of zeal as your own. Now if they make the summer season
their excuse: for I hear of their saying things of this kind,
“the present stifling heat is excessive, the scorching sun is
intolerable, we cannot bear being trampled and crushed in the
crowd, and to be steaming all over with perspiration and oppressed
by the heat and confined space:” I am ashamed of them, believe
me: for such excuses are 
<pb n="225" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_225.html" id="xiii.ii-Page_225" />womanish: indeed even in their case who
have softer bodies, and a weaker nature, such pretexts do not
suffice for justification. Nevertheless, even if it seems a
disgrace to make a reply to a defence of this kind, yet is it
necessary. For if they put forward such excuses as these and do not
blush, much more does it behove us not to be ashamed of replying to
these things. What then am I to say to those who advance these
pretexts? I would remind them of the three children in the furnace
and the flame, who when they saw the fire encircling them on all
sides, enveloping their mouth and their eyes and even their breath,
did not cease singing that sacred and mystical hymn to God, in
company with the universe, but standing in the midst of the pyre
sent up their song of praise to the common Lord of all with greater
cheerfulness than they who abide in some flowery field:<note place="end" n="746" id="xiii.ii-p13.2"><p class="endnote" id="xiii.ii-p14"> <scripRef passage="Song of the Three Children" id="xiii.ii-p14.1">Song of the Three Children</scripRef> in the Apocryphal addition to

with these three children I should think it proper to remind them
also of the lions which were in Babylon, and of Daniel and the
den:<note place="end" n="747" id="xiii.ii-p14.3"><p class="endnote" id="xiii.ii-p15"> <scripRef passage="Dan. vi. 24" id="xiii.ii-p15.1" parsed="|Dan|6|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Dan.6.24">Dan. vi.

this one only but also of another den, and the prophet Jeremiah,
and the mire in which he was smothered up to the neck.<note place="end" n="748" id="xiii.ii-p15.2"><p class="endnote" id="xiii.ii-p16"> <scripRef passage="Jerem. xxxviii. 5" id="xiii.ii-p16.1" parsed="|Jer|38|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Jer.38.5">Jerem.
xxxviii. 5</scripRef>.</p></note> And emerging
from these dens, I would conduct these persons who put forward heat
as an excuse into the prison and exhibit Paul to them there, and
Silas bound fast in the stocks, covered with bruises and wounds
lacerated all over their body with a mass of stripes, yet singing
praises to God at midnight and celebrating their holy vigil. For is
it not a monstrous thing that those holy men, both in the furnace
and the fire, and the den, and amongst wild beasts, and mire, and
in a prison and the stocks, and amidst stripes and gaolers, and
intolerable sufferings, never complained of any of these things,
but were continually uttering prayers and sacred songs with much
energy and fervent zeal, whilst we who have not undergone any of
their innumerable sufferings small or great, neglect our own
salvation on account of a scorching sun and a little short lived
heat and toil, and forsaking the assembly wander away, depraving
ourselves by going to meetings which are thoroughly unwholesome?
When the dew of the divine oracles is so abundant dost thou make
heat thy excuse? “The water which I will give him,” saith
Christ “shall be in him a well of water springing up into
everlasting life;”<note place="end" n="749" id="xiii.ii-p16.2"><p class="endnote" id="xiii.ii-p17"> <scripRef passage="John iv. 14" id="xiii.ii-p17.1" parsed="|John|4|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.4.14">John iv.
14</scripRef>.</p></note> and again; “He that believeth on
me as the Scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers
of living water.”<note place="end" n="750" id="xiii.ii-p17.2"><p class="endnote" id="xiii.ii-p18"> <scripRef passage="John vii. 38" id="xiii.ii-p18.1" parsed="|John|7|38|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.7.38">John vii.

wells and rivers, art thou afraid of material heat? Now in the
market place where there is so much turmoil and crowding, and
scorching wind, how is it that you do not make suffocation and heat
an excuse for absenting yourself? For it is impossible for you to
say that there you can enjoy a cooler temperature, and that all the
heat is concentrated here with us:—the truth is exactly the
reverse; here indeed owing to the pavement floor, and to the
construction of the building in other respects (for it is carried
up to a vast height), the air is lighter and cooler: whereas there
the sun is strong in every direction, and there is much crowding,
and vapour and dust, and other things which add to discomfort far
more than these. Whence it is plain that these senseless excuses
are the offspring of indolence and of a supine disposition,
destitute of the fire of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xiii.ii-p19">3. Now these remarks of mine are not so much
directed to them, as to you who do not bring them forward, do not
rouse them from their indolence, and draw them to this table of
salvation. Household slaves indeed when they have to discharge some
service in common, summon their fellow slaves, but you when you are
going to meet for this spiritual ministry suffer your fellow
servants to be deprived of the advantage by your neglect. “But
what if they do not desire it?” you say. Make them desire it by
your continual importunity: for if they see you insisting upon it
they certainly will desire it. Nay these things are a mere excuse
and pretence. How many fathers at any rate are there here who have
not their sons standing with them? Was it so difficult for thee to
bring hither some of thy children? Whence it is clear that the
absence of all the others who remain outside is due not only to
their own indolence, but also to your neglect. But now at least, if
never before, rouse yourselves up, and let each person enter the
Church accompanied by a member of his family: let them incite and
urge one another to the assembly here, the father his son, the son
his father, the husbands their wives, and the wives their husbands,
the master his slave, brother his brother, friend his friend: or
rather let us not summon friends only but also enemies to this
common treasury of good things. If thy enemy sees thy care for his
welfare, he will undoubtedly relinquish his hatred.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xiii.ii-p20">Say to him: “art thou not ashamed and dost thou
not blush before the Jews who keep their sabbath with such great
strictness, and from the evening of it abstain from all work? And
if they see the sun verging towards setting on the day of the
Preparation they break off business, and cut short their traffic:
and if <pb n="226" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_226.html" id="xiii.ii-Page_226" />any one who has been
making a purchase from them, before the evening, comes in the
evening bringing the price, they do not suffer themselves to take
it, or to accept the money.” And why do I speak of the price of
market wares and transaction of business? Even if it were possible
to receive a treasure they would rather lose the gain than trample
on their law. Are the Jews then so strict, and this when they keep
the law out of due season, and cling to an observance of it which
does not profit them, but rather does them harm: and wilt thou, who
art superior to the shadow, to whom it has been vouchsafed to see
the Sun of Righteousness, who art ranked as a citizen of the
Heavenly commonwealth, wilt thou not display the same zeal as those
who unseasonably cleave to what is wrong, thou who hast been
entrusted with the truth, but although thou art summoned here for
only a short part of the day, canst thou not endure to spend even
this upon the hearing of the divine oracles? and what kind of
indulgence, pray, could you obtain? and what answer will you have
to make which is reasonable and just? It is utterly impossible that
one who is so indifferent and indolent should ever obtain
indulgence, even if he should allege the necessities of worldly
affairs ten thousand times over as an excuse. Do you not know that
if you come and worship God and take part in the work which goes on
here, the business you have on hand is made much easier for you?
Have you worldly anxieties? Come here on that account that by the
time you spend here you may win for yourself the favour of God, and
so depart with a sense of security; that you may have Him for your
ally, that you may become invincible to the dæmons because you are
assisted by the heavenly hand. If you have the benefit of prayers
uttered by the fathers, if you take part in common prayer, if you
listen to the divine oracles, if you win for yourself the aid of
God, if, armed with these weapons, you then go forth, not even the
devil himself will be able henceforth to look you in the face, much
less wicked men who are eager to insult and malign you. But if you
go from your house to the market place, and are found destitute of
these weapons, you will be easily mastered by all who insult you.
This is the reason why both in public and private affairs, many
things occur contrary to our expectation, because we have not been
diligent about spiritual things in the first place, and secondarily
about the secular, but have inverted the order. For this reason
also the proper sequence and right arrangement of things has been
upset, and all our affairs are full of much confusion. Can you
imagine what distress and grief I suffer when I observe, that if a
public holy day and festival is at hand there is a concourse of all
the inhabitants of the city, although there is no one to summon
them; but when the holy day and festival are past, even if we
should crack our voice by continuing to call you all day long there
is no one who pays any heed? For often when turning these things
over in my mind I have groaned heavily, and said to myself: What is
the use of exhortation or advice, when you do everything merely by
the force of habit, and do not become a whit more zealous in
consequence of my teaching? For whereas in the festivals you need
no exhortation from me, but, when they are past you profit nothing
by my teaching, do you not show that my discourse, so far as you
are concerned, is superfluous?</p>

<p class="c10" id="xiii.ii-p21">4. Perhaps many of those who hear these things are
grieved. But such is not the sentiment of the indolent: else they
would put away their carelessness, like ourselves, who are daily
anxious about your affairs. And what gain do you make by your
secular transactions in proportion to the damage you sustain? It is
impossible to depart from any other assembly, or gathering, in the
possession of so much gain as you receive from the time spent here,
whether it be the law court, or council-chamber, or even the palace
itself. For we do not commit the administration of nations or
cities nor the command of armies to those who enter here, but
another kind of government more dignified than that of the empire
itself; or rather we do not ourselves commit it, but the grace of
the spirit.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xiii.ii-p22">What then is the government, more dignified than
that of the empire, which they who enter here receive? They are
trained to master untoward passions, to rule wicked lusts, to
command anger, to regulate ill-will, to subdue vainglory. The
emperor, seated on the imperial throne, and wearing his diadem, is
not so dignified as the man who has elevated his own inward right
reason to the throne of government over base passions, and by his
dominion over them has bound as it were a glorious diadem upon his
brow. For what profit is there, pray, in purple, and raiment
wrought with gold, and a jewelled crown, when the soul is in
captivity to the passions? What gain is there in outward freedom
when the ruling element within us is reduced to a state of
disgraceful and pitiable servitude. For just as when a fever
penetrates deep, and inflames all the inward parts, there is no
benefit to be got from the outward surface of the body, although it
is not affected in the same way: even so when our soul is violently
carried away by the passion within, no outward government, not
<pb n="227" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_227.html" id="xiii.ii-Page_227" />even the imperial throne,
is of any profit, since reason is deposed from the throne of empire
by the violent usurpation of the passions, and bows and trembles
beneath their insurrectionary movements. Now to prevent this taking
place prophets and apostles concur on all sides in helping us,
repressing our passions, and expelling all the ferocity of the
irrational element within us, and committing a mode of government
to us far more dignified than the empire. This is why I said that
they who deprive themselves of this care<note place="end" n="751" id="xiii.ii-p22.1"><p class="endnote" id="xiii.ii-p23"> <i>i.e</i>., the care of their brethren. That this
is the meaning appears from what follows.</p></note> receive a blow in the vital parts,
sustaining greater damage than can be inflicted from any other
quarter inasmuch as they who come here get greater gain than they
could derive from any other source: even as Scripture has declared.
The law said “Thou shalt not appear before the Lord empty;”<note place="end" n="752" id="xiii.ii-p23.1"><p class="endnote" id="xiii.ii-p24"> <scripRef passage="Exod. xxiii. 15" id="xiii.ii-p24.1" parsed="|Exod|23|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Exod.23.15">Exod.

enter not into the temple without sacrifices. Now if it is not
right to go into the house of God without sacrifices, much more
ought we to enter the assembly accompanied by our brethren: for
this sacrifice and offering is better than that, when thou bringest
a soul with thee into the Church. Do you not see doves which have
been trained, how they hunt for others when they are let out? Let
us also do this. For what kind of excuse shall we have, if
irrational creatures are able to hunt for an animal of their own
species, while we who have been honoured with reason and so much
wisdom neglect this kind of pursuit? I exhorted you in my former
discourse with these words: “Go, each of you to the houses of
your neighbours, wait for them to come out, lay hold of them, and
conduct them to their common mother: and imitate those who are mad
upon theatre going, who diligently arrange to meet each other and
so wait at early dawn to see that iniquitous spectacle.” Yet I
have not effected anything by this exhortation. Therefore I speak
again and shall not cease speaking, until I have persuaded you.
Hearing profits nothing unless it is accompanied by practice. It
makes our punishment heavier, if we continually hear the same
things and do none of the things which are spoken. That the
chastisement will be heavier, hear the statement of Christ. “If I
had not come and spoken to them they had not sin: but now they have
no cloke for their sin.”<note place="end" n="753" id="xiii.ii-p24.2"><p class="endnote" id="xiii.ii-p25"> <scripRef passage="John xv. 22" id="xiii.ii-p25.1" parsed="|John|15|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.15.22">John xv.

hearers; but when He wishes to instruct the speaker also, that even
he will not gain anything from his teaching unless his behaviour is
in close correspondence with his doctrine, and his manner of life
is in harmony with his speech, hear how the Apostle and the prophet
address themselves to him: for the latter says “but to the sinner
said God, why dost thou preach my laws and takest my covenant in
thy mouth, whereas thou hast hated instruction?”<note place="end" n="755" id="xiii.ii-p26.2"><p class="endnote" id="xiii.ii-p27"> <scripRef passage="Ps. iv. 16, 17" id="xiii.ii-p27.1" parsed="|Ps|4|16|4|17" osisRef="Bible:Ps.4.16-Ps.4.17">Ps. iv.
16, 17</scripRef>.</p></note> And the
Apostle, addressing himself to these same again who thought great
things of their teaching, speaks on this wise: “Thou art
confident that thou thyself art a leader of the blind, a light of
those who are in darkness, an instructor of the foolish, a teacher
of babes: thou therefore that teachest another teachest thou not
thyself?”<note place="end" n="756" id="xiii.ii-p27.2"><p class="endnote" id="xiii.ii-p28"> <scripRef passage="Rom. ii. 19-21" id="xiii.ii-p28.1" parsed="|Rom|2|19|2|21" osisRef="Bible:Rom.2.19-Rom.2.21">Rom. ii.

then as it could neither profit me the speaker to speak, nor you
the hearers to hear, unless we comply with the things which are
spoken, but rather would increase our condemnation, let us not
limit the display of our zeal to hearing only, but let us observe
what is said, in our deeds. For it is indeed a good thing to spend
time continually in hearing the divine oracles: but this good thing
becomes useless when the benefit to be derived from hearing is not
linked with it.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xiii.ii-p29">Therefore that you may not assemble here in
vain I shall not cease beseeching you with all earnestness, as I
have often besought you before, “conduct your brethren to us,
exhort the wanderers, counsel them not by word only but also by
deed.” This is the more powerful teaching—that which comes
through our manners and behaviour—Even if you do not utter a
word, but yet, after you have gone out of this assembly, by your
mien, and your look, and your voice and all the rest of your
demeanour you exhibit to the men who have been left behind the gain
which you have brought away with you, this is sufficient for
exhortation and advice. For we ought to go out from this place as
it were from some sacred shrine, as men who have descended from
heaven itself, who have become sedate, and philosophical, who do
and say everything in proper measure: and when a wife sees her
husband returning from the assembly, and a father his son, and a
friend his friend, and an enemy his enemy, let them all receive an
impression of the benefit which you have derived from coming here:
and they will receive it, if they perceive that you have become
milder, more philosophical, more devout. Consider what privileges
you enjoy who hast been initiated into the mysteries,<note place="end" n="757" id="xiii.ii-p29.1"><p class="endnote" id="xiii.ii-p30"> <i>i.e</i>., admitted to Holy Communion, which
catechumens were not permitted to witness.</p></note> with what
company thou offerest up that mystic hymn, with what company thou
criest aloud the “Ter sanctus.” 
<pb n="228" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_228.html" id="xiii.ii-Page_228" />Teach “them that are without” that thou hast
joined the chorus of the Seraphim, that thou art ranked as a
citizen of the commonwealth above, that thou hast been enrolled in
the choir of Angels, that thou hast conversed with the Lord, that
thou hast been in the company of Christ. If we regulate ourselves
in this way we shall not need to say anything, when we go out to
those who are left behind: but from our advantage they will
perceive their own loss and will hasten hither, so as to enjoy the
same benefits themselves. For when, merely by the use of their
senses, they see the beauty of your soul shining forth, even if
they are the most stupid of men, they will become enamoured of your
goodly appearance. For if corporeal beauty excites those who behold
it, much more will symmetry of soul be able to move the spectator,
and stimulate him to equal zeal. Let us then adorn our inward man,
and let us be mindful of the things which are said here, when we go
out: for there especially is it a proper time to remember them; and
just as an athlete displays in the lists the things which he has
learned in the training school: even so ought we to display in our
transactions in the world without the things which we have heard
here.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xiii.ii-p31">5. Bear in mind then the things which are said
here, that when you have gone out and the devil lays hold of you
either by means of anger or vainglory, or any other passion, you
may call to remembrance the teaching which you have received here
and may be able easily to shake off the grasp of the evil one. Do
you not see the wrestling-masters in the practising grounds, who,
after countless contests having obtained exemption from wrestling
on account of their age, sit outside the lines by the side of the
dust and shout to those who are wrestling inside, telling one to
grasp a hand, or drag a leg, or seize upon the back, and by many
other directions of that kind, saying, “if you do so and so you
will easily throw your antagonist,” they are of the greatest
service to their pupils? Even so do thou look to thy training
master, the blessed Paul, who after countless victories is now
sitting outside the boundary, I mean this present life, and cries
aloud to us who are wrestling, shouting out by means of his
Epistles, when he sees us overcome by wrath and resentment of
injuries, and choked by passion; “if thy enemy hunger feed him,
if he thirst give him drink;”<note place="end" n="758" id="xiii.ii-p31.1"><p class="endnote" id="xiii.ii-p32"> <scripRef passage="Rom. xii. 20" id="xiii.ii-p32.1" parsed="|Rom|12|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.12.20">Rom. xii.
20</scripRef>.</p></note>—a beautiful precept full of
spiritual wisdom, and serviceable both to the doer and the
receiver. But the reminder of the passage causes much perplexity,
and does not seem to correspond to the sentiment of him who uttered
the former words. And what is the nature of this? the saying that
“by so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.” For by
these words he does a wrong both to the doer and the receiver: to
the latter by setting his head on fire, and placing coals upon it;
for what good will he get from receiving food and drink in
proportion to the evil he will suffer from the heaping of coals on
his head? Thus then the recipient of the benefit is wronged, having
a greater vengeance inflicted on him, but the benefactor also is
injured in another way. For what can he gain from doing good to his
enemies when he acts in the hope of revenge? For he who gives meat
and drink to his enemy for the purpose of heaping coals of fire on
his head would not become merciful and kind, but cruel and harsh,
having inflicted an enormous punishment by means of a small
benefit. For what could be more unkind than to feed a person for
the purpose of heaping coals of fire on his head? This then is the
contradiction: and now it remains that the solution should be
added, in order that by those very things which seem to do violence
to the letter of the law you may clearly see all the wisdom of the
lawgiver. What then is the solution?</p>

<p class="c10" id="xiii.ii-p33">That great and noble-minded man was well aware of
the fact that to be reconciled quickly with an enemy is a grievous
and difficult thing; grievous and difficult, not on account of its
own nature, but of our moral indolence. But he commanded us not
only to be reconciled with our enemy, but also to feed him; which
was far more grievous than the former. For if some are infuriated
by the mere sight of those who have annoyed them, how would they be
willing to feed them when they were hungry? And why do I speak of
the sight infuriating them? If any one makes mention of the
persons, and merely introduces their name in society, it revives
the wound in our imagination, and increases the heat of passion.
Paul then being aware of all these things and wishing to make what
was hard and difficult of correction smooth and easy, and to
persuade one who could not endure to see his enemy, to be ready to
confer that benefit already mentioned upon him, added the words
about coals of fire, in order that a man prompted by the hope of
vengeance might hasten to do this service to one who had annoyed
him. And just as the fisherman surrounding the hook on all sides
with the bait presents it to the fishes in order that one of them
hastening to its accustomed food may be captured by means of it and
easily held fast: even so Paul also wishing to lead on the man who
has been wronged to bestow a benefit on the man who has <pb n="229" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_229.html" id="xiii.ii-Page_229" />wronged him does not present to him
the bare hook of spiritual wisdom, but having covered it as it were
with a kind of bait, I mean the “coals of fire,” invites the
man who has been insulted, in the hope of inflicting punishment, to
confer this benefit on the man who has annoyed him; but when he has
come he holds him fast in future, and does not let him make off,
the very nature of the deed attaching him to his enemy; and he all
but says to him: “if thou art not willing to feed the man who has
wronged thee for piety’s sake: feed him at least from the hope of
punishing him.” For he knows that if the man once sets his hand
to the work of conferring this benefit, a starting-point is made
and a way of reconciliation is opened for him. For certainly no one
would have the heart to regard a man continually as his enemy to
whom he has given meat and drink, even if he originally does this
in the hope of vengeance. For time as it goes on relaxes the
tension of his anger. As then the fisherman, if he presented the
bare hook would never allure the fish, but when he has covered it
gets it unawares into the mouth of the creature who comes up to it:
so also Paul if he had not advanced the expectation of inflicting
punishment would never have persuaded those who were wronged to
undertake to benefit those who had annoyed them. Wishing then to
persuade those who recoiled in disgust, and were paralysed by the
very sight of their enemies, to confer the greatest benefits upon
them, he made mention of the coals of fire, not with a view of
thrusting the persons in question into inexorable punishment, but
in order that when he had persuaded those who were wronged to
benefit their enemies in the expectation of punishing them, he
might afterwards in time persuade them to abandon their anger
altogether.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xiii.ii-p34">6. Thus then did he encourage the man who has been
wronged; but observe also how he unites again the man who has done
the wrong to him who has been provoked. First of all by the very
manner of the benefit: (for there is no one so degraded and
unfeeling as to be unwilling, when he receives meat and drink, to
become the servant and friend of him who does this for him): and in
the second place through the dread of vengeance. For the passage,
“by so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head” seems
indeed to be addressed to the person who gives the food; but it
more especially touches him who has caused the annoyance, in order
that through fear of this punishment he may be deterred from
remaining continually in a state of enmity, and being aware that
the reception of food and drink might do him the greatest mischief
if he constantly retains his animosity, may suppress his anger. For
thus he will be able to quench the coals of fire. Wherefore the
proposed punishment and vengeance both induces the one who has been
wronged to benefit him who has annoyed him, and it deters and
checks him who has given the provocation, and impels him to
reconciliation with the man who gives him meat and drink. Paul
therefore linked the two persons by a twofold bond, the one
depending on a benefit, the other on an act of vengeance. For the
difficulty is to make a beginning and to find an opening for the
reconciliation: but when that has once been cleared in whatever way
it may be, all which follows will be smooth and easy. For even if
at first the man who has been annoyed feeds his enemy in the hope
of punishing him, yet becoming his friend by the act of giving him
food he will be able to expel the desire of vengeance. For when he
has become a friend he will no longer feed the man who has been
reconciled to him, with an expectation of this kind. Again he who
has given the provocation, when he sees the man who has been
wronged electing to give him meat and drink, casts out all his
animosity, both on account of this deed, and also of his fear of
the punishment which is in store for him, even if he be excessively
hard and harsh and stony hearted, being put to shame by the
benevolence of him who gives him food, and dreading the punishment
reserved for him, if he continues to be an enemy after accepting
the food.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xiii.ii-p35">For this reason Paul did not stop even here in his
exhortation, but when he has emptied each side of wrath he proceeds
to correct their disposition, saying, “be not overcome of
evil.” “For if,” he says, “you continue to bear resentment
and to seek revenge you seem indeed to conquer your enemy, but in
reality you are being conquered by evil, that is, by wrath: so that
if you wish to conquer, be reconciled, and do not make an attack
upon your adversary;” for a brilliant victory is that in which by
means of good, that is to say by forbearance, you overcome evil,
expelling wrath and resentment. But the injured man, when inflamed
with passion would not have borne these words. Therefore when he
had satisfied his wrath he proceeded to conduct him to the best
reason for reconciliation, and did not permit him to remain
permanently animated by the wicked hope of vengeance. Dost thou
perceive the wisdom of the lawgiver? And that you may learn that he
introduced this law only on account of the weakness of those who
would not otherwise be content to make terms amongst themselves,
hear how Christ, when He ordained a law on this same subject did
not pro<pb n="230" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_230.html" id="xiii.ii-Page_230" />pose the same
reward, as the Apostle; but, having said “Love your enemies, do
good to them that hate you,” which means give them food and
drink, He did not add “for in so doing ye shall heap coals of
fire on their heads:” but what did He say? “that ye may become
like your Father who is in Heaven.”<note place="end" n="759" id="xiii.ii-p35.1"><p class="endnote" id="xiii.ii-p36"> <scripRef passage="Matt. v. 44" id="xiii.ii-p36.1" parsed="|Matt|5|44|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.44">Matt. v.
44</scripRef>.</p></note> Naturally so, for He was
discoursing to Peter, James, and John and the rest of the apostolic
band: therefore He proposed that reward. But if you say that even
on this understanding the precept is onerous you improve once more
the defence which I am making for Paul, but you deprive yourself of
every plea of indulgence. For I can prove to you that this which
seems to you onerous was accomplished under the Old Dispensation
when the manifestation of spiritual wisdom was not so great as it
is now. For this reason also Paul did not introduce the law in his
own words, but used the very expressions which were employed by him
who originally brought it in, that he might leave no room for
excuse to those who do not observe it: for the precept “if thine
enemy hunger feed him, if he thirst give him drink” is not the
utterance of Paul in the first instance, but of Solomon.<note place="end" n="760" id="xiii.ii-p36.2"><p class="endnote" id="xiii.ii-p37"> <scripRef passage="Prov. xxv. 21, 22" id="xiii.ii-p37.1" parsed="|Prov|25|21|25|22" osisRef="Bible:Prov.25.21-Prov.25.22">Prov. xxv.
21, 22</scripRef>.</p></note> For this
reason he quoted the words that he might persuade the hearer that
for one who has been advanced to such a high standard of wisdom to
regard an old law as onerous and grievous which was often fulfilled
by the men of old time, is one of the basest things possible. Which
of the ancients, you ask, fulfilled it? There were many, but
amongst others David especially did so more abundantly. He did not
indeed merely give food or drink to his enemy, but also rescued him
several times from death, when he was in jeopardy; and when he had
it in his power to slay him he spared him once, twice, yea many
times. As for Saul he hated and abhorred him so much after the
countless good services which he had done, after his brilliant
triumphs, and the salvation which he had wrought in the matter of
Goliath, that he could not bear to mention him by his own name, but
called him after his father. For once when a festival was at hand,
and Saul, having devised some treachery against him, and contrived
a cruel plot, did not see him arrive—“where,” said he, “is
the son of Jesse?”<note place="end" n="761" id="xiii.ii-p37.2"><p class="endnote" id="xiii.ii-p38"> <scripRef passage="1 Sam. xx. 23" id="xiii.ii-p38.1" parsed="|1Sam|20|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Sam.20.23">1 Sam. xx.
23</scripRef>.</p></note> He called him by his father’s
name, both because on account of his hatred he could not endure the
recollection of his proper name, and also because he thought to
damage the distinguished position of that righteous man by a
reference to his low birth;—a miserable and despicable thought:
for certainly, even if he had some accusation to bring against the
father this could in no wise injure David. For each man is
answerable for his own deeds, and by these he can be praised and
accused. But as it was, not having any evil deed to mention, he
brought forward his low birth, expecting by this means to throw his
glory into the shade, which in fact was the height of folly. For
what kind of offence is it to be the child of insignificant and
humble men, “the son of Jesse,” but when David found him
sleeping inside the cave, he did not call him the “son of
Kish,” but by his title of honour: “for I will not lift up my
hand,” he said, “against the Lord’s anointed.”<note place="end" n="762" id="xiii.ii-p38.2"><p class="endnote" id="xiii.ii-p39"> <scripRef passage="1 Sam. xxvi. 11" id="xiii.ii-p39.1" parsed="|1Sam|26|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Sam.26.11">1 Sam.
xxvi. 11</scripRef>.</p></note> So purely
free was he from wrath and resentment of injuries: he calls him the
Lord’s anointed who had done him such great wrongs, who was
thirsting for his blood, who after his countless good services had
many times attempted to destroy him. For he did not consider how
Saul deserved to be treated, but he considered what was becoming
for himself both to do and to say, which is the greatest stretch of
moral wisdom. How so? When thou hast got thy enemy in a prison,
made fast by a twofold, or rather by a triple chain, confinement of
space, dearth of assistance, and necessity of sleep, dost thou not
demand a penalty and punishment of him? “No,” he says; “for I
am not now regarding what he deserves to suffer, but what it
behoves me to do.” He did not look to the facility for slaying,
but to the accurate observance of the moral wisdom which was
becoming to him. And yet which of the existing circumstances was
not sufficient to prompt him to the act of slaughter? Was not the
fact that his enemy was delivered bound into his hands a sufficient
inducement? For you are aware I suppose that we hasten more eagerly
to deeds for which facilities abound, and the hope of success
increases our desire to act, which was just what happened then in
his case.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xiii.ii-p40">Well! did the captain who then counselled and
urged him to the deed,<note place="end" n="763" id="xiii.ii-p40.1"><p class="endnote" id="xiii.ii-p41"> Abishai. <scripRef passage="1 Sam. xxvi. 8" id="xiii.ii-p41.1" parsed="|1Sam|26|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Sam.26.8">1

induce him to slay? no one of these things moved him: in fact the
very facility for slaughter averted him from it: for he bethought
him that God had put Saul in his hands for the purpose of
furnishing ample ground and opportunity for the exercise of moral
wisdom. You then perhaps admire him, because he did not cherish the
memory of any of his past evils: but I am much more astonished at
him for another reason. And what is this? that the fear of future
events did not 
<pb n="231" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_231.html" id="xiii.ii-Page_231" />impel him to lay violent hands on his
enemy. For he knew clearly that if Saul escaped his hands, he would
again be his adversary; yet he preferred exposing himself to danger
by letting go the man who had wronged him, to providing for his own
security by laying violent hands upon his foe. What could equal
then the great and generous spirit of this man, who, when the law
commanded eye to be plucked out for eye, and tooth for tooth, and
retaliation on equal terms,<note place="end" n="764" id="xiii.ii-p41.2"><p class="endnote" id="xiii.ii-p42"> <scripRef passage="Deut. xix. 21" id="xiii.ii-p42.1" parsed="|Deut|19|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Deut.19.21">Deut. xix.
21</scripRef>.</p></note> not only abstained from doing this,
but exhibited a far greater measure of moral wisdom? At least if he
had slain Saul at that time he would have retained credit for moral
wisdom unimpaired, not merely because he had acted on the
defensive, not being himself the originator of violence, but also
because by his great moderation he was superior to the precept
“an eye for an eye.” For he would not have inflicted one
slaughter in return for one; but, in return for many deaths, which
Saul endeavoured to bring on him, having attempted to slay him not
once or twice but many times, he would have brought only one death
on Saul; and not only this, but if he had proceeded to avenge
himself out of fear of the future, even this, combined with the
things already mentioned, would procure him the reward of
forbearance without any deduction. For he who is angry on account
of the things which have been done to him, and demands satisfaction
would not be able to obtain the praise of forbearance: but when a
man dismisses the consideration of all past evils, although they
are many and painful, but is compelled to take steps for
self-defence from fear of the future, and by way of providing for
his own security, no one would deprive him of the rewards of
moderation.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xiii.ii-p43">7. Nevertheless David did not act even thus, but
found a novel and strange form of moral wisdom: and neither the
remembrance of things past, nor the fear of things to come, nor the
instigation of the captain, nor the solitude of the place, nor the
facility for slaying, nor anything else incited him to kill; but he
spared the man who was his enemy, and had given him pain just as if
he was some benefactor, and had done him much good. What kind of
indulgence then shall we have, if we are mindful of past
transgressions, and avenge ourselves on those who have given us
pain, whereas that innocent man who had undergone such great
sufferings and expected more and worse evils to befall him in
consequence of saving his enemy, is seen to spare him, so as to
prefer incurring danger himself and to live in fear and trembling,
rather than put to a just death the man who would cause him endless
troubles?</p>

<p class="c10" id="xiii.ii-p44">His moral wisdom then we may perceive, not
only from the fact that he did not slay Saul, when there was so
strong a compulsion, but also that he did not utter an irreverent
word against him, although he who was insulted would not have heard
him. Yet we often speak evil of friends when they are absent, he on
the contrary not even of the enemy who had done him such great
wrong. His moral wisdom then we may perceive from these things: but
his lovingkindness and tender care from what he did after these
things. For when he had cut off the fringe of Saul’s garment, and
had taken away the bottle of water he withdrew afar off and stood
and shouted, and exhibited these things to him whose life he had
preserved, doing so not with a view to display and ostentation, but
desiring to convince him by his deeds that he suspected him without
a cause as his enemy, and aiming therefore at winning him into
friendship. Nevertheless when he had even thus failed to persuade
him, and could have laid hands on him, he again chose rather to be
an exile from his country and to sojourn in a strange land, and
suffer distress every day, in procuring necessary food than to
remain at home and vex his adversary. What spirit could be kinder
than his? He was indeed justified in saying “Lord remember David
and all his meekness.”<note place="end" n="765" id="xiii.ii-p44.1"><p class="endnote" id="xiii.ii-p45"> <scripRef passage="Psalm cxxxii. 1" id="xiii.ii-p45.1" parsed="|Ps|32|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.32.1">Psalm

offences that thou mayest receive a royal pardon for thy offences;
but if any one has done thee great wrongs, the greater the wrongs
you forgive, the greater will be the pardon which you will receive.
Therefore we have been instructed to say “Forgive us, as we
forgive,” that we may learn that the measure of our forgiveness
takes its beginning in the first place from ourselves. Wherefore in
proportion to the severity of the evil which the enemy does to us
is the greatness of the benefit which he bestows. Let us then be
earnest and eager to be reconciled with those who have vexed us,
whether their wrath be just or unjust. For if thou art reconciled
here, thou art delivered from judgment in the other world; but if
in the interval while the hatred is still going on, death
interrupting steps in and carries the enmity away with it, it
follows of necessity that the trial of the case should be
<pb n="232" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_232.html" id="xiii.ii-Page_232" />brought forward in the
other world. As then many men when they have a dispute with one
another, if they come to a friendly understanding together outside
the law court save themselves loss, and alarm, and many risks, the
issue of the case turning out in accordance with the sentiment of
each party; but if they severally entrust the affair to the judge
the only result to them will be loss of money, and in many cases a
penalty, and the permanent endurance of their hatred; even so here
if we come to terms during our present life we shall relieve
ourselves from all punishment; but if while remaining enemies we
depart to that terrible tribunal in the other world we shall
certainly pay the utmost penalty at the sentence of the judge
there, and shall both of us undergo inexorable punishment: he who
is unjustly wroth because he is thus unjustly disposed, and he who
is justly wroth, because he has, however justly, cherished
resentment. For even if we have been unjustly ill-treated, we ought
to grant pardon to those who have wronged us. And observe how he
urges and incites those who have unjustly given pain to
reconciliation with those whom they have wronged. “If thou
offerest thy gift before the altar, and there rememberest that thy
brother hath ought against thee, go thy way; first be reconciled to
thy brother.”<note place="end" n="767" id="xiii.ii-p46.2"><p class="endnote" id="xiii.ii-p47"> <scripRef passage="Matt. v. 23, 24" id="xiii.ii-p47.1" parsed="|Matt|5|23|5|24" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.23-Matt.5.24">Matt. v.

say, “assemble, and offer thy sacrifice” but “be reconciled
and then offer it.” Let it lie there, he says, in order that the
necessity of making the offering may constrain him who is justly
wroth to come to terms even against his will. See how he again
prompts us to go to the man who has provoked us when he says
“Forgive your debtors in order that your Father may also forgive
your trespasses.” For He did not propose a small reward, but one
which far exceeds the magnitude of the achievement. Considering all
these things then, and counting the recompense which is given in
this case and remembering that to wipe away sins does not entail
much labour and zeal, let us pardon those who have wronged us. For
that which others scarcely accomplish, I mean the blotting out of
their own sins by means of fasting and lamentations, and prayers,
and sackcloth, and ashes, this it is possible for us easily to
effect without sackcloth and ashes and fasting if only we blot out
anger from our heart, and with sincerity forgive those who have
wronged us. May the God of peace and love, having banished from our
soul all wrath and bitterness, and anger, deign to grant that we

<p class="c9" id="xiv.ii-p5">1. <span class="c12" id="xiv.ii-p5.1">I account</span> you happy
for the zeal, beloved, with which you flock into the Father’s
house. For from this zeal I have ground for feeling confidence
about your health also with respect to the soul; for indeed the
school of the Church is an admirable surgery—a surgery, not for
bodies, but for souls. For it is spiritual, and sets right, not
fleshly wounds, but errors of the mind,<note place="end" n="769" id="xiv.ii-p5.2"><p class="endnote" id="xiv.ii-p6"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="xiv.ii-p6.1">διανοίας</span>. In

medicine is the word. This medicine is compounded, not from the
herbs growing on the earth, but from the words proceeding from
heaven—this no hands of physicians, but tongues of preachers have
dispensed. On this account it lasts right through; and neither is
its virtue impaired by length of time, nor defeated by any strength
of diseases. For certainly the medicines of physicians have both
these defects; for while they are fresh they display their proper
strength, but when much time has passed; just as those bodies which
have grown old; they become weaker; and often too the difficult
character of maladies is wont to baffle them; since they are but
human. Whereas the divine medicine is not such as this; but after
much time has intervened, it still retains all its inherent virtue.
Ever since at least Moses was born (for from thence dates the
beginning of the Scripture) it has healed so many human beings; and
not only has it not lost its proper power, but neither has any
disease ever yet overcome it. This medicine it is not possible to
get by payment of silver; but he who has displayed sincerity of
purpose and disposition goes his way having it all. On account of
this both rich and poor alike obtain the benefit of this healing
process. For where there is a necessity to pay down money the man
of large means indeed shares the benefit; but the poor man often
has to go away deprived of the gain, since his income does not
suffice him for the making up of the medicine. But in this case,
since it is not possible to pay down silver coin, but it is needful
to display faith and a good purpose, he who has paid down these
with forwardness of mind, this is he who most reaps the advantage;
since indeed these are the price paid for the medicinal treatment.
And the rich and the poor man share the benefit alike; or rather it
is not alike that they share the benefit, but often the poor man
goes away in the enjoyment of more. What ever can be the reason? It
is because the rich man, possessed beforehand by many thoughts,
having the pride and puffed-up temper belonging to wealthiness;
living with carelessness and lazy ease as companions, receives the
medicine of the hearing of the Scriptures not with much attention,
nor with much earnestness; but the poor man, far removed from
delicate living and gluttony and indolence; spending all his time
in handicraft and honest labours; and gathering hence much
<pb n="236" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_236.html" id="xiv.ii-Page_236" />love of wisdom for the soul;
becomes thereby more attentive and free from slackness, and is wont
to give his mind with more accurate care to all that is said:
whence also, inasmuch as the price he has paid is higher, the
benefit which he departs having reaped is greater.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xiv.ii-p7">2. It is not as absolutely bringing an
accusation against those who are wealthy that I say all this; nor
as praising the poor without reference to circumstances: for
neither is wealth an evil, but the having made a bad use of wealth;
nor is poverty a virtue, but the having made a virtuous use of
poverty. That rich man who was in the time of Lazarus was
punished,<note place="end" n="770" id="xiv.ii-p7.1"><p class="endnote" id="xiv.ii-p8"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="xiv.ii-p8.1">ἐκολ€ζετο</span>. The imperfect denotes the
continuous character of the punishment. So <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="xiv.ii-p8.2">ἐπηνειτο</span>
“had lasting praise.” “ἡ <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="xiv.ii-p8.3">‡ρετὴ œξις ἐπαινετή</span>. 
Aristotle <i>Eth</i>.</p></note> not because
he was rich, but because he was cruel and inhuman. And that poor
man who rested in the bosom of Abraham was praised, not because he
was poor, but because he had borne his poverty with
thankfulness.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xiv.ii-p9">For of things—(now attend carefully to this
saying; for it will avail to put into you sufficient religious
knowledge, and to cast out all unsound reasoning, and to bring
about your having your judgment right concerning the truth of
things)—well, of things some are by nature morally good, and
others the contrary; and others neither good nor evil, but they
occupy the intermediate position. A good thing piety is by nature,
impiety an evil thing; a good thing virtue, an evil thing
wickedness; but wealth and poverty in themselves are neither the
one nor the other; but from the will of those who use them they
become either the one or the other. For if thou hast used thy
wealth for purposes of philanthropy, the thing becomes to thee a
foundation of good; but if for rapine and grasping and insolence,
thou hast turned the use of it to the direct opposite; but for this
wealth is not chargeable, but he who has used his wealth for
insolence. So also we may say of poverty: if thou have borne it
nobly by giving thanks to the Master, what has been done becomes to
thee a cause and ground for receiving crowns; but if on account of
this thou blaspheme thy Creator, and accuse Him for His providence,
thou hast again used the thing to an evil purpose. But just as in
that case it is not wealth that is responsible for the avarice, but
the person who has made a bad use of wealth, so also here we are
not to lay the blame of the blasphemy on poverty, but on him who
did not choose to bear the thing in a sober spirit. For in every
case both the praise and the blame belong to our own will and
choice. Good is wealth, yet not absolutely, but to him only to whom
it is not sin; and again poverty is wicked, but not absolutely, but
only in the mouth of the impious, because he is discontented,
because he blasphemes, because he is indignant, because he accuses
Him who has made him.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xiv.ii-p10">3. Let us not therefore accuse riches, nor
revile poverty absolutely, but those who do not will<note place="end" n="771" id="xiv.ii-p10.1"><p class="endnote" id="xiv.ii-p11"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="xiv.ii-p11.1">'Εθ™λοντας</span>. In its theological sense. “<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="xiv.ii-p11.2">Θ™λημα σαρκός</span>.” Not a classical,
but an ecclesiastical word (<scripRef passage="John i. 13" id="xiv.ii-p11.3" parsed="|John|1|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.1.13">John i. 13</scripRef>). So our Lord, <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="xiv.ii-p11.4">εἰ' τις θ™λει</span>, has the will.</p></note> to use these
virtuously; for the things themselves lie in the middle. But as I
was saying (for it is good to return to the former subject), both
rich and poor enjoy the benefit of the medicines administered here
with the same boldness and freedom; and often the poor with more
earnestness. For the special excellence of the medicines is not
this only, that they heal souls, that their virtue is not destroyed
by length of time, that they are not worsted by any disease, that
the benefit is publicly offered gratuitously, that the healing
treatment is on a footing of equality both for rich and poor—but
they have another quality also not inferior to these good points.
Pray of what character is this? It is that we do not publicly
expose those who come to this surgery. For they who go off to the
surgeries of the outside world, have many who examine their wounds,
and unless the physician have first uncovered the sore, he does not
apply the dressing; but here not so, but seeing as we do
innumerable patients, we go through the medical treatment of them
in a latent manner. For not by dragging into publicity those who
have sinned do we thus noise abroad the sins committed by them; but
after putting forth our teaching, as common to all, we leave it
entirely to the conscience of the hearers; so that each may draw to
himself from what is said the suitable medicine for his own wound.
For there proceeds the word of doctrine from the tongue of the
speaker, containing accusation of wickedness, praise of virtue,
blame of lewdness, commendation of chasteness, censure of pride,
praise of gentleness, just as a medicine of varied and manifold
ingredients, compounded from every kind; and to take what is
applicable to himself and salutary is the part of each of the
hearers. The word then issues openly, and settling into the
conscience of each, secretly both affords the healing treatment
which comes from it, and before the malady has been divulged, has
often restored health.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xiv.ii-p12">4. You at all events heard yesterday how I extolled
the power of prayer, how I reproached those who pray with
listlessness; without having publicly exposed one of them. Those
then who were conscious to themselves of earnestness, accepted that
commendation of prayer, 
<pb n="237" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_237.html" id="xiv.ii-Page_237" />and became still more earnest by the
praises, while those who were conscious to themselves of
listlessness, accepted on the other hand the rebuking, and put off
their carelessness. But neither these nor those do we know; and
this ignorance is serviceable to both—how, I now tell you. He who
has heard the commendations of prayer and is conscious to himself
of earnestness, were he to have many witnesses of the
commendations, would have lapsed towards pride; but, as it is, by
having secretly accepted the praise, he is removed from all
arrogance. On the other hand he who is conscious to himself of
listlessness, having heard the accusation, has become better from
the accusation, as having no one of men a witness of the rebuking;
and this was of no ordinary profit to him. For on account of the
being flurried at the opinion of the vulgar,<note place="end" n="772" id="xiv.ii-p12.1"><p class="endnote" id="xiv.ii-p13"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="xiv.ii-p13.1">οἱ πολλόι</span>, as
opposed to <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="xiv.ii-p13.2">οἱ
χαρι™ντες</span>, those of culture and refinement. Arist.
<i>Eth</i>.</p></note> so long as we may think that we
escape notice in our wickedness, we exert ourselves to become
better; but when we have become notorious to all, and have lost the
consolation derived from the escaping notice, we grow more
shameless and remiss rather. And just as sores become more painful
by being unbandaged and frequently exposed to cold air, so also the
soul after having sinned, if in the presence of many it be rebuked
for what it has done amiss, grows thereby more shameless. In order
therefore that this might not take place, the word administered its
medicine to you covertly. And that you may understand<note place="end" n="773" id="xiv.ii-p13.3"><p class="endnote" id="xiv.ii-p14"> A common sense of <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="xiv.ii-p14.1">

was a favorite author with Chrysostom.</p></note> that the
gain which this covert treatment has is great, hear what the Christ
says. “If thy brother have committed a fault against thee
convince him of it,” and he did not say “between him and the
whole town,” nor, “between thee and the whole people,”<note place="end" n="774" id="xiv.ii-p14.4"><p class="endnote" id="xiv.ii-p15"> The article here has this universal force. <scripRef passage="Matt. xviii. 15" id="xiv.ii-p15.1" parsed="|Matt|18|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.18.15">Matt. xviii. 15</scripRef>.</p></note> but “only
between thee and him.” Let the accusation, he says, be
unwitnessed to, in order that the change to amendment may be made
easy of digestion. A great good surely, the making the advice
unpublished. Sufficient is the conscience, sufficient that
incorruptible judge. It is not so much thou who rebukest him who
has done wrong as his own conscience (that accuser is the sharper),
nor dost thou do it with the more exact knowledge of the faults
committed. Add not therefore wound to wound by exposing him who has
done wrong; but administer for thyself the counsel unwitnessed.
This therefore we are doing now—the very thing that Paul also
did, framing the indictment against him who among the Corinthians
had sinned without citing of witnesses. And hear how. “On this
account,” he says, “brethren, I have applied these figures of
speech to myself and Apollos.” And yet not he himself nor Apollos
were they who had rent the people in schism and divided the Church;
but all the same he concealed the accusation, and just as by some
masks, by hiding the countenances of the defendants by his own and
Apollos’ names, he afforded them power to amend of that
wickedness. And again, “Lest in some way after I have come God
humble me, and I may have to mourn many of those who have before
sinned, and have not repented over the uncleanness and
lasciviousness which they had committed.”<note place="end" n="775" id="xiv.ii-p15.2"><p class="endnote" id="xiv.ii-p16"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. iv. 6; 2 Cor. xii. 21" id="xiv.ii-p16.1" parsed="|1Cor|4|6|0|0;|2Cor|12|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.4.6 Bible:2Cor.12.21">1 Cor. iv.
6; 2 Cor. xii. 21</scripRef>.</p></note> See how here also he indefinitely
mentions those who had sinned, in order that he might not, by
openly bringing the accusation, render the soul of those who had
sinned more shameless. Therefore, just as we administer our
reproofs with so much sparing of your feelings, so do ye also with
all seriousness receive the correction; and attend with carefulness
to what is said.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xiv.ii-p17">5. We discoursed to you yesterday about the
power which is in prayer. I pointed out<note place="end" n="776" id="xiv.ii-p17.1"><p class="endnote" id="xiv.ii-p18"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="xiv.ii-p18.1">̓Εδειξα  'Ενδειξις</span>. Lat. index (<i>digitus</i>) the
fore-finger.</p></note> how the devil then lies in wait,
deceiver that he is. For since he sees very great gain accruing to
us from prayer, then most he assails us, in order that he may
disable us from our defence;<note place="end" n="777" id="xiv.ii-p18.2"><p class="endnote" id="xiv.ii-p19"> The idea seems to be that of making the accused
entirely forget the defence, such as used to be written for him by
some Attic orator.</p></note> that he may send us off home
empty-handed. And just as before magistrates, when the officers of
the court who are about the person of the magistrate have a hostile
feeling toward those who come before him, they by their staves
drive them away to a distance, preventing their coming near and
resorting to lamentation and so obtaining compassion; so also the
devil, when he has seen us coming to the judge, drives us away to a
distance, not by any staff, but through our own slackness. For he
knows, he knows clearly, that if they have come to him in a sober
spirit, and have told the sins committed, and have mourned with
their soul fervent, they will depart having received full
forgiveness; for God loves mankind; and on this account he is
beforehand with them, and debars them from access,<note place="end" n="778" id="xiv.ii-p19.1"><p class="endnote" id="xiv.ii-p20"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="xiv.ii-p20.1">žντευξις</span>, an Aristotelic term. “<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="xiv.ii-p20.2">τῆς πρὸς τούς πολλούς ἐντεύξεως</span>,
the way of addressing a large body.</p></note> in order
that they may obtain no one of the things which they need. But the
soldiers of magistrates with violence scare away those who are
coming to them; but he with no compulsion, but by deceiving us, and
throwing us into security. On this account we are not deserving
even of allowance, since we voluntarily deprive ourselves of the
good things. Prayer with 
<pb n="238" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_238.html" id="xiv.ii-Page_238" />earnestness is a light of the understanding
and soul—a light unquenchable and perpetual. On this account he
throws into our minds countless rubbish-heaps of imaginations; and
things which we never had imagined, these collecting together at
the very moment of prayer he pours down upon our souls. And just as
winds often rushing from an opposite quarter by a violent gust
extinguish a lamp’s flame as it is being lighted, so also the
devil, when he has seen the flame of our prayer being kindled,
blowing it on every side with the blasts of countless thoughts,
does not desist before and until he has quenched the light. But the
very thing which they who are kindling those lamps do, this let us
also do. And what do they do? When they see a violent wind coming,
by laying their finger upon the opening of the lamp they bar the
entrance against the wind. For so long as he assails from without
we shall be able to stand against him; but when we have opened to
him the doors of the mind, and have received the enemy inside;
after that we are no longer able to withstand even a little; but,
having on all sides completely extinguished the memory,<note place="end" n="779" id="xiv.ii-p20.3"><p class="endnote" id="xiv.ii-p21"> Still continuing the simile of a wind.</p></note> just as a
smoking lamp, he allows our mouth to utter empty words. But just as
they put their finger upon the opening of the lamp, so let us lay
consideration upon our mind: let us close off from the wicked
spirit the entrance, in order that he may not quench our light of

<p class="c10" id="xiv.ii-p22">6. Prayer is a strong piece of armour and a
great security. You heard yesterday how the three children,
fettered as they were, destroyed the power of the fire; how they
trampled down the blaze; how they overcame the furnace, and
conquered the operation of the element. Hear to-day again how the
noble and great Isaac overcame the nature itself of bodies through
prayer. They destroyed<note place="end" n="780" id="xiv.ii-p22.1"><p class="endnote" id="xiv.ii-p23"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="xiv.ii-p23.1">

loosed the bonds of incapacitated nature. And learn how he effected
this. “Isaac,” it says, “prayed<note place="end" n="781" id="xiv.ii-p23.2"><p class="endnote" id="xiv.ii-p24"> ἐδεετο. Denotes continuance in prayer. Comp.

was barren.” This has to-day been read to you; yesterday the
sermon was about prayer; and to-day again there is a demonstration
of the power of prayer. See how the grace of the Spirit has ordered
that what has been read to-day harmonises with what was said
yesterday. “Isaac,” it says, “prayed concerning Rebecca his
wife, because she was barren.” This first is worth inquiring
into, for what cause she was barren. She was of a life admirable
and replete with much chastity—both herself and her husband. We
cannot lay hold<note place="end" n="782" id="xiv.ii-p24.2"><p class="endnote" id="xiv.ii-p25"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="xiv.ii-p25.1">ἐπιλαβ™σθαι</span>, as in wrestling.</p></note> of the life
of those just ones, and say that the barrenness was the work of
sin. And not only was she herself barren, but also his mother
Sarah, who had borne him; not only was his mother barren and his
wife, but also his daughter-in-law, the wife of Jacob, Rachel. What
is the meaning of this band of barren ones? All were righteous, all
living in virtue, all were witnessed to by God. For it was of them
that He said, “I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and
the God of Jacob.” Of the same persons Paul also thus speaks.
“For which cause God is not ashamed to call himself their
God.”<note place="end" n="783" id="xiv.ii-p25.2"><p class="endnote" id="xiv.ii-p26"> <scripRef passage="Heb. xi. 16" id="xiv.ii-p26.1" parsed="|Heb|11|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Heb.11.16">Heb. xi.

commendations of them in the New, many the praises of them in the
Old Testament. On all sides they were bright and illustrious, and
yet they all had barren wives, and continued in childlessness until
an advanced period. When therefore thou seest man and wife living
with virtue; when thou seest them beloved of God, caring for piety,
and yet suffering the malady of childlessness; do not suppose that
the childlessness is at all a retribution for sins. For many are
God’s reasons for the dispensation, and to us inexplicable; and
for all we must be heartily thankful, and think those only wretched
who live in wickedness; not those who do not possess children.
Often God does it expediently, though we know not the cause of
events. On this account in every case it is our duty to admire His
wisdom, and to glorify His unspeakable love of man.</p>

Acharn</i>. 377–383.</p></note> this consideration indeed is able
to school us in moral character, but it is necessary also to state
the cause for which those women were barren. What then was the
cause? It was in order that when thou hast seen the Virgin bringing
forth our common Master, thou mightest not disbelieve. Wherefore
exercise thy mind in the womb of the barren; in order that when
thou hast seen the womb, disabled and bound as it is, being opened
to the bearing of children from the grace of God, thou mightest not
marvel at hearing that a virgin has brought forth. Or rather even
marvel and be astounded; but do not disbelieve the marvel. When the
Jew says to thee, “how did the virgin bear?” say to him “how
did she bear who was barren and 
<pb n="239" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_239.html" id="xiv.ii-Page_239" />enfeebled by old age?” There were then two
hindrances, both the unseasonableness of her age and the
unserviceableness of nature; but in the case of the Virgin there
was one hindrance only, the not having shared in marriage. The
barren one therefore prepares the way for the virgin. And that thou
mayest learn that it was on this account that the barren ones had
anticipated it, in order that the Virgin’s childbirth might be
believed, hear the words of Gabriel which were addressed to
her—For when he had come and said to her, “thou shalt conceive
in the womb and bear a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus;”
the Virgin was astonished and marvelled, and said, “how will this
be to me, since I know not a man.” What then said the Angel?
“The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee.” Seek not the sequence of
nature, he says, when that which takes place is above nature; look
not round for marriage and throes of child-birth, when the manner
of the birth is too grand for marriage. “And how will this be,”
she says, “since I know not a husband.” And verily on this
account shall this be, since thou knowest no husband. For didst
thou know a husband, thou wouldest not have been deemed worthy to
serve this ministry. So that, for the reason why thou disbelievest,
for this believe. And thou wouldest not have been deemed worthy to
serve this ministry, not because marriage is an evil; but because
virginity is superior; and right it was that the entry of the
Master should be more august than ours; for it was royal, and the
king enters through one more august. It was necessary that He
should both share as to birth, and be diverse from ours. Wherefore
both these things are managed.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xiv.ii-p29">For the being born from the womb is common in
respect to us, but the being born without marriage is a thing
greater than on a level with us. And the gestation and conception
in the belly belongs to human nature; but that the pregnancy should
take place without sexual intercourse is too august for human
nature.<note place="end" n="785" id="xiv.ii-p29.1"><p class="endnote" id="xiv.ii-p30"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="xiv.ii-p30.1">'Αυτὴ</span>. The use of <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="xiv.ii-p30.2">

purpose both these things took place, in order that thou mayest

<p class="c10" id="xiv.ii-p31">8. And pray consider the wisdom of all that
was done. Neither did the pre-eminence injure the likeness and
kinship to us, nor did the kinship to us dim the pre-eminence; but
both were displayed by all the circumstances; and the one had our
condition in its entirety, and the other what was diverse compared
with us. But just as I was saying, on this account the barren ones
went before, in order that the Virgin’s child-birth might be
believed, that she<note place="end" n="786" id="xiv.ii-p31.1"><p class="endnote" id="xiv.ii-p32"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="xiv.ii-p32.1">'Αυτὴ</span>. The use of <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="xiv.ii-p32.2">

in that promise and undertaking which she heard from the angel,

High shall overshadow thee”—thus, he says, thou art able to
bear. Look not to the earth; it is from the heavens that the
operation will come. That which takes place is a grace of the
Spirit; pray inquire not about nature and laws of marriage. But
since those words were too high for her, he wills to afford also
another demonstration. But do thou, pray, observe how the barren
one leads her on the way to the belief in this. For since that
demonstration was too high for the Virgin’s intelligence, hear
how he brought down what he said to lower things also, leading her
by the hand by sensible facts. For “behold,” he says,
“Elizabeth thy kinswoman—she also has conceived a son in her
old age; and this month is the sixth to her who was called
barren.” Seest thou that the barren one was for the sake of the
Virgin? since with what object did he adduce to her the
child-bearing of her kinswoman? with what object did he say, “in
her old age?” with what object did he add, “who was called
barren?” It was by way of inducing her by all these things,
manifestly, to the believing the glad annunciation. For this cause
he spoke of both the age and the disabling effect of nature; for
this cause he awaited the time also which had elapsed from the
conception; for he did not tell to her the glad tidings immediately
from the beginning,<note place="end" n="788" id="xiv.ii-p33.2"><p class="endnote" id="xiv.ii-p34"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="xiv.ii-p34.1">Προοιμίων</span>, lit.

to have passed to the barren one, in order that the puerperal
swelling might, for the rest, be a pledge of the pregnancy, and an
indisputable demonstration might arise of the conception. And pray
again look at the intelligence of Gabriel. For he neither reminded
her<note place="end" n="789" id="xiv.ii-p34.3"><p class="endnote" id="xiv.ii-p35"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="xiv.ii-p35.1">'Αυτῆς, <i>lege</i></span> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="xiv.ii-p35.2">δš αῦτήν</span>.</p></note> of Sarah,
nor of Rebecca, nor of Rachel; and yet they also were barren, and
they had grown old, and that which took place was a marvel; but the
stories were ancient. Now things new and recent and occurring in
our generation are wont to induce us into the belief of marvels
more than those which are old. On this account having let those
women alone, that she should understand from her kinswoman
Elizabeth herself what was coming upon her, he brought it forward;
so as from her to lead her to her own—that most awful and august
childbirth. For the child-birth of the barren one lay between ours
and that of the Master less indeed than that of the Virgin, but
greater <pb n="240" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_240.html" id="xiv.ii-Page_240" />than ours. On
this account it was by Elizabeth lying between, just as by some
bridge, that he lifted up the mind of the Virgin from the travail
which is according to nature, to that which is above nature.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xiv.ii-p36">9. I did desire to say more, and to teach you other
reasons for which Rebecca, and Rachel, were barren; but the time
does not permit; urging on the discourse to the power of prayer.
For on this account indeed I have mooted all these points, that ye
might understand how the prayer of Isaac unbound the barrenness of
his wife; and that prayer for so long a time. “Isaac,” it says,
“continually prayed about Rebecca his wife, and God listened to
him.” For do not suppose that he invoked God and had immediately
been listened to; for he had spent much time in praying to God. And
if you desire to learn how much, I will tell you this too with
exactness. He had spent the number of twenty years in praying to
God. Whence is this manifest? from the sequence itself. For the
Scripture, desiring to point out the faith and the endurance and
the love of wisdom of that righteous man, did not break off and
leave untold even the time, but made it also clear to us, covertly
indeed, so as to rouse up our indolence; but nevertheless did not
allow it to be uncertain. Hear then how it covertly indicated to us
the time. “Now Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebecca, a
daughter of Bethuel the Syrian.” You hear how many years old he
was when he brought home his wife: “Forty years old,” it says,
“he was when he took Rebecca.” But since we have learnt how
many years old he was when he married his wife, let us learn also
when he after all became a father, and how many years old he was
then, when he begat Jacob; and we shall be able to see how long a
time his wife had remained barren; and that during all that time he
continued to pray to God. How many years old then was he when he
begat Jacob? “Jacob,” it says, “came forth laying hold with
his right hand of his brother’s heel: on this account he called
him Jacob, and him Esau. Now Isaac was sixty years old when he
begat them.” If therefore when he brought Rebecca home he was
forty years old, and when he begat the sons sixty, it is very plain
that his wife had remained barren for twenty years between, and
during all this time Isaac continued to pray to God.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xiv.ii-p37">10. After this do we not feel shame, and hide
our faces, at seeing that righteous man for twenty years
persevering<note place="end" n="790" id="xiv.ii-p37.1"><p class="endnote" id="xiv.ii-p38"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="xiv.ii-p38.1">Παραμ™νοντα</span>,
waiting; as it were, like a beggar at the door.</p></note> and not
desisting; we ourselves after a first or second petition often
fainting and indignant? And yet he indeed had in large measure
liberty of speech towards God,<note place="end" n="791" id="xiv.ii-p38.2"><p class="endnote" id="xiv.ii-p39"> π‡ρῥησίαν, a phrase of

discontent at the delay of the giving, but remained patient,
whereas we, laden with countless sins, living with an evil
conscience, displaying no good will towards the Master; if we are
not heard before having spoken, are bewildered, impatiently recoil,
desist from asking—on this account we always retire with empty
hands. Who has for twenty years besought God for one thing, as this
righteous man did? or rather who for twenty months only? Yesterday
I was saying that they are many who pray with slackness, and
yawning, and stretching themselves, and continually shifting their
attitude, and indulging in every carelessness in their
prayers—but to-day I have found also another damage attaching
itself to their prayers more destructive than that one. For many,
throwing themselves prostrate, and striking the ground with their
forehead, and pouring forth hot tears, and groaning bitterly from
the heart<note place="end" n="792" id="xiv.ii-p39.5"><p class="endnote" id="xiv.ii-p40"> Literally “from below.” Comp. Virgil <i>
Æn</i>. i. 37; <i>imoqœ trahens de pectore vocem</i>.</p></note> and
stretching out their hands, and displaying much earnestness, employ
this warmth and forwardness against their own salvation. For it is
not on behalf of their own sins that they beseech God; nor are they
asking forgiveness of the offences committed by them; but they are
exerting this earnestness against their enemies entirely, doing
just the same thing as if one, after whetting his sword, were not
to use the weapon against his enemies, but to thrust it through his
own throat. So these also use their prayers not for the remission
of their own sins, but about revenge on their enemies; which is to
thrust the sword against themselves. This too the wicked one has
devised, in order that on all sides we may destroy ourselves, both
through slackness and through earnestness. For the one class by
their carelessness in their prayers exasperate God, by displaying
contempt through their slackness; and the others, when they display
earnestness, display the earnestness on the other hand against
their own salvation. “A certain person,” he (the devil) says,
“is slack: that is sufficient for me with a view to his obtaining
nothing; this man is earnest and thoroughly aroused; what then must
be done to accomplish the same result? I cannot slacken his
earnestness, nor throw him into carelessness; I will contrive his
de<pb n="241" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_241.html" id="xiv.ii-Page_241" />struction in the other
way. How so? I will manage that he use his earnestness for
transgressing the law:” (for the praying against one’s personal
enemies is a transgression of law). “He shall depart therefore
not only having gained nothing by his earnestness, but also having
endured the hurt which is greater than that caused through
slackness.” Such as these are the injuries of the devil: the one
sort he destroys through their remissness; and the other through
their earnestness itself, when it is shown not according to God’s
laws.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xiv.ii-p41">11. But it is also worth hearing the very
words of their prayer, and how the words are of a puerile mind; of
how infantile a soul. I am ashamed in truth when about to repeat
them; but it is absolutely necessary to repeat them, and to imitate
that coarse tongue. What then are the words? “Avenge me of my
enemies, show them that I too have God (on my side).” They do not
then learn, man, that we have God, when we are indignant and angry
and impatient; but when we are gentle and meek and subdued, and
practise all love of wisdom. So also God said, “Let your light
shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify
your Father who is in the heavens.”<note place="end" n="793" id="xiv.ii-p41.1"><p class="endnote" id="xiv.ii-p42"> <scripRef passage="Matt. v. 16" id="xiv.ii-p42.1" parsed="|Matt|5|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.16">Matt. v.

insult to God, the making a request to God against thine enemies?
And how is it an insult? one will say. Because He Himself said,
“pray for your enemies;” and brought in this divine law. When
therefore thou claimest that the legislator should relax his own
laws; and callest upon him to legislate in opposition to himself;
and supplicatest him who had forbidden thee to pray against thine
enemies to hear thee praying against thine enemies; thou art not
praying in doing this, nor calling upon him; but thou art insulting
the lawgiver, and acting with drunken violence towards him, who is
sure to give to thee the good things which result from prayer. And
how is it possible to be heard when praying, tell me, when thou
exasperatest him who is sure to hear? For by doing these things
thou art pushing thine own salvation into a pit, and art rushing
down a precipice, by striking thine enemy before the king’s
eyes.<note place="end" n="794" id="xiv.ii-p42.2"><p class="endnote" id="xiv.ii-p43"> To strike any one within “the precincts of the

fellow-slaves. At least dare to do this in a ruler’s presence,
and though thou hast done countless public services, thou wilt
straightway surely be led away to execution. Then (I ask) in the
presence of a ruler dost thou not dare to insult thine equal, but
when doing this in God’s presence, tell me, dost thou not
shudder, nor fear when in the time of entreaty and prayer being so
savage and turning thyself into a wild beast; and displaying
greater want of feeling than he who demanded payment of the hundred
pence?<note place="end" n="795" id="xiv.ii-p43.1"><p class="endnote" id="xiv.ii-p44"> <scripRef passage="Matt. xviii. 28" id="xiv.ii-p44.1" parsed="|Matt|18|28|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.18.28">Matt.

thou art more insolent than he, listen to the story itself. A
certain man owed ten thousand talents to his master; then, not
having (wherewith) to pay, he entreated him to be long-suffering,
in order that, his wife having been sold and his house and his
children, he might settle his master’s claim. And the master
seeing him lamenting had compassion on him, and remitted the ten
thousand talents. He having gone out and found another servant
owing him a hundred pence, seizing his throat demanded them with
great cruelty and inhumanity. The Master having heard this threw
him into the prison, and laid on him again the debt of the ten
thousand talents which he had before remitted; and he paid the
penalty of the cruelty shown towards his fellow-servant.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xiv.ii-p45">12. Now do thou consider in how much more
unfeeling and insensible in a way thou hast acted even than he,
praying against thine enemies. He did not beg his master to demand,
but he himself demanded, the hundred pence; whereas thou even
callest on the Master for this shameless and forbidden demand. And
he seized his fellow-servant’s throat not before his lord’s
eyes, but outside; while thou in the very moment of prayer,
standing in the King’s presence, doest this. And if he, for doing
this without either having urged his master to the demand, and
after going forth, met with no forgiveness; thou, both stirring up
the Master to (exacting) this forbidden payment, and doing this
before his eyes, what sort of penalty will thou have to pay? tell
me. But thy mind is inflamed by the memory of the enmity, and
swells, and thy heart rises,<note place="end" n="796" id="xiv.ii-p45.1"><p class="endnote" id="xiv.ii-p46"> Possibly “stomach.” Comp. <i>Thuc</i>.

who has caused pain, thou art unable to reduce the swelling of thy
thought. But set against this inflammation the memory resulting
from thine own sins committed the fear resulting from the
punishment to come. Recall to memory for how many things thou art
accountable to thy master, and that for all those things thou owest
Him satisfaction; and this fear will surely overcome that anger;
since indeed this is far more powerful than that passion. Recall
the memory of hell and punishment and vengeance during the time of
thy prayer; and thou wilt not be able even to receive thine enemy
into <pb n="242" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_242.html" id="xiv.ii-Page_242" />thy mind.<note place="end" n="797" id="xiv.ii-p46.2"><p class="endnote" id="xiv.ii-p47"> Because it is filled with better thoughts. No room

mind contrite, humble thy soul by the memory of the offences
committed by thee, and wrath will not be able even to trouble thee.
But the cause of all these evils is this, that we scrutinise the
sins of all others with great exactitude; while we let our own pass
with great remissness. Whereas we ought to do the contrary—to
keep our own faults unforgotten; but never even to admit a thought
of those of others. If we do this we shall both have God
propitious, and shall cease cherishing immortal anger against our
neighbours, and we shall never have any one as an enemy; and even
if we should have at any time we shall both quickly put an end to
his enmity, and should obtain speedy pardon for our own sins. For
just as he who treasures up the memory of wrong against his
neighbour does not permit the punishment upon his own sins to be
done away; so he who is clear of anger will speedily be clear of
sins also. For if we, wicked as we are and enslaved to passion, on
account of the commandment of God overlook all the faults committed
against us, much more will He who is a lover of mankind, and good,
and free from any passion, overlook our delinquencies, rendering to
us the recompense of our kindly spirit towards our neighbour in the
forgiveness of our own sins: which God grant that we may attain, by
the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom is
the glory and the dominion, to the ages of the ages.

EUTROPIUS.</span></p>

<p class="c9" id="xv.ii-p2"><span class="c12" id="xv.ii-p2.1">The</span> interest of the two
following discourses depends not only on their intrinsic value as
specimens of Chrysostom’s eloquence, but also on the singular and
dramatic character of the incidents which gave occasion to
them.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xv.ii-p3">Arcadius the Emperor of the East like his
brother Honorius the Emperor of the West was a man of feeble
intellect. The history of the Empire under his reign is a
melancholy record of imbecility on the part of the nominal rulers:
of faithlessness and unscrupulous ambition on the part of their
ministers. The chief administrator of affairs in the beginning of
the reign of Arcadius was Rufinus, an Aquitanian Gaul; the very
model of an accomplished adventurer. His intrigues, his arrogance,
his rapacious avarice excited the indignation of the people, and he
was at last assassinated by the troops to whom he was making an
oration in the presence of the Emperor. His place in the favour and
confidence of Arcadius was soon occupied by the eunuch Eutropius.
The career of this person was a strange one. Born a slave, in the
region of Mesopotamia, he had passed in boyhood and youth through
the hands of many owners, performing the most menial offices
incident to his position. At length Arnithus, an old military
officer who had become his master, presented him to his daughter on
her marriage; and in the words of the poet Claudian, “the future
consul of the East was made over as part of a marriage dowry.”<note place="end" n="798" id="xv.ii-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="xv.ii-p4"> In Eutrop. i. 104, 105.</p></note> But the
young lady after a time grew tired of the slave who was becoming
elderly and wrinkled, and without trying to sell him turned him out
of her household. He picked up a precarious living in
Constantinople and was often in great want until an officer of the
court took pity on him, and procured him a situation in the lower
ranks of the imperial chamberlains. This was the beginning of his
rise. By the diligence with which he discharged his humble duties,
by occasional witty sayings, and the semblance of a fervent piety
he attracted the notice of the great Emperor Theodosius (the father
of Arcadius), and gradually won his confidence so as to be employed
on difficult and delicate missions. On the death of Theodosius he
became in the capacity of grand chamberlain the intimate adviser
and constant attendant of Arcadius and the most subtle and
determined rival of Rufinus. It was by his contrivance that the
scheme of Rufinus for marrying his own daughter to the Emperor was
defeated: and that Eudoxia the daughter of a Frankish general was
substituted for her. After the murder of Rufinus the government was
practically in his hands; but he exercised his power more craftily
than the vain and boastful Gaul. He contrived at first to discharge
all the duties which fell to his lot as chamberlain with humble
assiduity, and sought no other title than he already possessed.
Slowly but surely however he climbed to the summit of power by the
simple process of putting out of the way on various pretexts all
dangerous competitors. He deprived his victims of their last hope
of escape by abolishing the right of the Church to afford shelter
to fugitives. He sold the chief offices of the State, and the
command of the provinces to the highest bidders. By surrounding the
Emperor with a crowd of frivolous companions, by dissipating his
mind with a perpetual round of amusements, by taking him every
spring to Ancyra in Phrygia where he was subjected to the
enervating influ<pb n="246" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_246.html" id="xv.ii-Page_246" />ence of a soft climate and
luxurious style of living he made the naturally feeble intellect of
Arcadius more feeble still and withdrew it from the power of every
superior mind but his own. From the pettiest detail of domestic
life to the most important affairs of state, the wily minister at
length ruled supreme. Arcadius was little more than a magnificently
dressed puppet, and the eunuch slave was the real master of half
the Roman world. It was by his advice that on the death of
Nectarius in 397 that Chrysostom had been appointed, very much
against his own will, to the vacant See of Constantinople. If
Eutropius expected to find a complaisant courtier in the new
Archbishop he certainly sustained a severe disappointment. Some
little pretences which he made of assisting the work of the Church
by patronising Chrysostom’s missionary projects could not blind
the Archbishop to the gross venality of his administration, or
exempt him from the censure and warning of one who was too honest
and bold to be any respecter of persons. In fact when the
Archbishop declaimed against the cupidity and oppressions of the
rich it was obvious to all that Eutropius was the most signal
example of these vices. At last the minister, not content to remain
as he was—enjoying the reality of power without the
name—prepared the way for his own ruin by inducing the Emperor to
bestow on him the titles of Patrician and Consul. The acquisition
of these venerable names by the eunuch slave caused a profound
sensation of shame and indignation throughout the Empire, but
especially in the Western capital, where they were bound up with
all the noblest and most glorious memories in the history of the
Roman people. The name of Eutropius was omitted from the Fasti or
catalogue of consuls inscribed in the Capitol at Rome. Amidst the
general decadence and degeneracy of public spirit in the Empire the
West did not descend, could not have descended, to those depths of
servile adulation to which the Byzantines stooped at the
inauguration of Eutropius as Consul. The senate, and all the great
officials military and civil poured into the palace of the Cæsars
to offer their homage, and emulated each other in the honor of
kissing the hand and even the wrinkled visage of the eunuch. They
saluted him as the bulwark of the laws, and the second father of
the Emperor. Statues of bronze or marble were placed in various
parts of the city representing him in the costume of warrior or
judge, and the inscriptions on them styled him third founder of the
city, after Byzas, and Constantine. No wonder that Claudian
declaimed with bitter sarcasm against “a Byzantine nobility and
Greek divinities” and invokes Neptune by a stroke of his trident
to unseat and submerge the degenerate city which had inflicted such
a deep disgrace on the Empire.<note place="end" n="799" id="xv.ii-p4.1"><p class="endnote" id="xv.ii-p5"> In Eutrop. ii. 39, 136.</p></note> A blow indeed was about to fall
upon the eastern capital, directed not by the hand of a mythic
deity, but of a stout barbarian soldier. The consequences of it
were averted from the city only by the sacrifice of the new consul
upon whom it fell with crushing effect. He sank never to rise
again. Tribigild, a distinguished gothic soldier who had been
raised to the rank of Tribune in the Roman army, had demanded
higher promotion for himself and higher pay for a body of military
colonists in Phrygia of which he had the command. His petition had
been coldly dismissed by Eutropius; Tribigild resent the affront
and with the troops which he commanded broke into revolt. Eutropius
entrusted the conduct of an expedition against him to one of his
favorites, who suffered a most ignominious defeat in which he
perished, and the greater part of his army was cut to pieces.
Constantinople was convulsed with terror and indignation. Gäinas
another Goth in command of the city troops declared that he could
do nothing to check the progress of the revolt unless Eutropius was
banished, the principal author of all the evils of the State. His
demand was backed by the Empress Eudoxia, who had experienced much
insolence from the minister. Eutropius was deprived of his official
dignity, his property was declared confiscated, and he was
commanded to quit the palace instantly under pain of death. Whither
could the poor wretch fly who was thus in a moment hurled from the
pinnacle of power into the lowest depths of degradation and
destitu<pb n="247" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_247.html" id="xv.ii-Page_247" />tion. There
was but one place to which he could naturally turn in his
distress—the sanctuary of the Church; but by the cruel irony of
his fate, a law of his own devising here barred his entrance. Yet
he knew that the law prohibiting asylum had been resented and
resisted by the Church and it might be that the Archbishop would
connive at the violation of the obnoxious measure by the very
person who had passed it. He resolved to make the experiment. In
the humblest guise of a suppliant, tears streaming down his
puckered cheeks, his scant grey hairs smeared with dust, he crept
into the Cathedral, drew aside the curtain in front of the altar
and clung to one of the columns which supported it. Here he was
found by Chrysostom in a state of pitiable and abject terror, for
soldiers in search of him had entered the Church, and the
clattering of their arms could be heard on the other side of the
thin partition which concealed the fugitive. With quivering lips he
craved the asylum of the church, and he was not repulsed as the
destroyer of the refuge which he now sought.<note place="end" n="800" id="xv.ii-p5.1"><p class="endnote" id="xv.ii-p6"> Hom. i. 2.</p></note> Chrysostom rejoiced in the
opportunity afforded to the church of taking a noble revenge on her
adversary.<note place="end" n="801" id="xv.ii-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="xv.ii-p7"> Hom. i. 3.</p></note> He concealed
Eutropius in the sacristy, confronted his pursuers, and refused to
surrender him. “None shall violate the sanctuary save over my
body: the church is the bride of Christ who has entrusted her honor
to me and I will never betray it.” He desired to be conducted to
the Emperor and taken like a prisoner between two rows of spearmen
from the Cathedral to the palace<note place="end" n="802" id="xv.ii-p7.1"><p class="endnote" id="xv.ii-p8"> Hom. ii. 1.</p></note> where he boldly vindicated the
church’s right of asylum in the presence of the Emperor. Arcadius
promised to respect the retreat of the fallen minister, and with
difficulty persuaded the angry troops to accept his decision. The
next day was Sunday, and the Cathedral was thronged with a vast
multitude eager to hear what the golden mouth of the Archbishop
would utter who had dared in defence of the Church’s right to
defy the law, and confront the tide of popular feeling. But few
probably were prepared to witness such a dramatic scene as was
actually presented. The Archbishop had just taken his seat in the
“Ambon” or high reading desk a little westward of the chancel
from which he was wont to preach on the account of his diminutive
stature, and a sea of faces was upturned to him waiting for the
stream of golden eloquence when the curtain of the sanctuary was
drawn aside and disclosed the cowering form of the miserable
Eutropius clinging to one of the columns of the Holy Table. Many a
time had the Archbishop preached to unheeding ears on the vain and
fleeting character of worldly honor, prosperity, luxury, and
wealth: now he would force attention, and drive home his lesson to
the hearts of his vast congregation by pointing to a visible
example of fallen grandeur in the poor wretch who lay grovelling
behind him.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xv.ii-p9">Eutropius remained for some days within the
precincts of the Church and then suddenly departed. Whether he
mistrusted the security of his shelter and hoped to make his escape
in disguise, or whether he surrendered himself on the understanding
that exile would be substituted for capital punishment cannot be
certainly known. Chrysostom declared that if he had not abandoned
the Church, the Church would never have given him up.<note place="end" n="803" id="xv.ii-p9.1"><p class="endnote" id="xv.ii-p10"> Hom. ii. i.</p></note> Anyhow he
was captured and conveyed to Cyprus, but soon afterwards he was
tried at Constantinople on various charges of high crimes and
misdemeanors against the State, and condemned to suffer capital
punishment. He was taken to Chalcedon and there beheaded.<note place="end" n="804" id="xv.ii-p10.1"><p class="endnote" id="xv.ii-p11"> For a fuller account of all these events, see Life
of St. John Chrysostom by W. R. W. Stephens (pp. 298–356, 3d
edition).</p></note> The second
of the two following discourses was delivered a few days after
Eutropius had quitted the sanctuary of the Church.</p>

<p class="c38" id="xv.iii-p4">On Eutropius, the eunuch, Patrician and Consul.</p>

<p class="c9" id="xv.iii-p5">1. “<span class="c12" id="xv.iii-p5.1">Vanity</span> of
vanities, all is vanity”—it is always seasonable to utter this
but more especially at the present time. Where are now the
brilliant surroundings of thy consulship? where are the gleaming
torches? Where is the dancing, and the noise of dancers’ feet,
and the banquets and the festivals? where are the garlands and the
curtains of the theatre? where is the applause which greeted thee
in the city, where the acclamation in the hippodrome and the
flatteries of spectators? They are gone—all gone: a wind has
blown upon the tree shattering down all its leaves, and showing it
to us quite bare, and shaken from its very root; for so great has
been the violence of the blast, that it has given a shock to all
these fibres of the tree and threatens to tear it up from the
roots. Where now are your feigned friends? where are your drinking
parties, and your suppers? where is the swarm of parasites, and the
wine which used to be poured forth all day long, and the manifold
dainties invented by your cooks? where are they who courted your
power and did and said everything to win your favour? They were all
mere visions of the night, and dreams which have vanished with the
dawn of day: they were spring flowers, and when the spring was over
they all withered: they were a shadow which has passed away—they
were a smoke which has dispersed, bubbles which have burst, cobwebs
which have been rent in pieces. Therefore we chant continually this
spiritual song—“Vanity of vanities, all is vanity.” For this
saying ought to be continually written on our walls, and garments,
in the market place, and in the house, on the streets, and on the
doors and entrances, and above all on the conscience of each one,
and to be a perpetual theme for meditation. And inasmuch as
deceitful things, and maskings and pretence seem to many to be
realities it behoves each one every day both at supper and at
breakfast, and in social assemblies to say to his neighbour and to
hear his neighbour say in return “vanity of vanities, all is
vanity.” Was I not continually telling thee that wealth was a
runaway? But you would not heed me. Did I not tell thee that it was
an unthankful servant? But you would not be persuaded. Behold
actual experience has now proved that it is not only a runaway, and
ungrateful servant, but also a murderous one, for it is this which
has caused thee now to fear and tremble. Did I not say to thee when
you continually rebuked me for speaking the truth, “I love thee
better than they do who flatter thee?” “I who reprove thee care
more for thee than they who pay thee court?” Did I not add to
these words by saying that the wounds of friends were more to be
relied upon than the voluntary kisses of enemies.<note place="end" n="805" id="xv.iii-p5.2"><p class="endnote" id="xv.iii-p6"> <scripRef passage="Prov. xxvii. 6" id="xv.iii-p6.1" parsed="|Prov|27|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Prov.27.6">Prov.
xxvii. 6</scripRef>.</p></note> If you had submitted to my wounds
their kisses would not have wrought thee this destruction: for my
wounds work health, but their kisses have produced an incurable
disease. Where are now thy cup-bearers, where are they who cleared
the way for thee in the market place, and sounded thy praises
endlessly in the ears of all? They have fled, they have disowned
thy friendship, they are providing for their own safety by means of
thy distress. But I do not act thus, nay in thy misfortune I do not
abandon thee, and now when thou art fallen I protect and tend thee.
And the Church which <pb n="250" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_250.html" id="xv.iii-Page_250" />you
treated as an enemy has opened her bosom and received thee into it;
whereas the theatres which you courted, and about which you were
oftentimes indignant with me have betrayed and ruined thee. And yet
I never ceased saying to thee “why doest thou these things?”
“thou art exasperating the Church, and casting thyself down
headlong,” yet thou didst hurry away from all my warnings. And
now the hippodromes, having exhausted thy wealth, have whetted the
sword against thee, but the Church which experienced thy untimely
wrath is hurrying in every direction, in her desire to pluck thee
out of the net.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xv.iii-p7">2. And I say these things now not as trampling
upon one who is prostrate, but from a desire to make those who are
still standing more secure; not by way of irritating the sores of
one who has been wounded, but rather to preserve those who have not
yet been wounded in sound health; not by way of sinking one who is
tossed by the waves, but as instructing those who are sailing with
a favourable breeze, so that they may not become overwhelmed. And
how may this be effected? by observing the vicissitudes of human
affairs. For even this man had he stood in fear of vicissitude
would not have experienced it; but whereas neither his own
conscience, nor the counsels of others wrought any improvement in
him, do ye at least who plume yourselves on your riches profit by
his calamity: for nothing is weaker than human affairs. Whatever
term therefore one may employ to express their insignificance it
will fall short of the reality; whether he calls them smoke, or
grass, or a dream or spring flowers, or by any other name; so
perishable are they, and more naught than nonentities;<note place="end" n="806" id="xv.iii-p7.1"><p class="endnote" id="xv.iii-p8"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="xv.iii-p8.1">τῶν οὐδεν ὀντων
οὐδαμινώτερα</span>.</p></note> but that
together with their nothingness they have also a very perilous
element we have a proof before us. For who was more exalted than
this man? Did he not surpass the whole world in wealth? had he not
climbed to the very pinnacle of distinction? did not all tremble
and fear before him? Yet lo! he has become more wretched than the
prisoner, more pitiable than the menial slave, more indigent than
the beggar wasting away with hunger, having every day a vision of
sharpened swords and of the criminal’s grave, and the public
executioner leading him out to his death; and he does not even know
if he once enjoyed past pleasure, nor is he sensible even of the
sun’s ray, but at mid day his sight is dimmed as if he were
encompassed by the densest gloom. But even let me try my best I
shall not be able to present to you in language the suffering which
he must naturally undergo, in the hourly expectation of death. But
indeed what need is there of any words from me, when he himself has
clearly depicted this for us as in a visible image? For yesterday
when they came to him from the royal court intending to drag him
away by force, and he ran for refuge to the holy furniture,<note place="end" n="807" id="xv.iii-p8.2"><p class="endnote" id="xv.iii-p9"> Holy <i>vessels</i> would be the literal
rendering of the word (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="xv.iii-p9.1">σκ™υεσι</span>), but it is clear from what follows
that the altar is intended.</p></note> his face was
then, as it is now, no better than the countenance of one dead: and
the chattering of his teeth, and the quaking and quivering of his
whole body, and his faltering voice, and stammering tongue, and in
fact his whole general appearance were suggestive of one whose soul
was petrified.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xv.iii-p10">3. Now I say these things not by way of reproaching
him, or insulting his misfortune, but from a desire to soften your
minds towards him, and to induce you to compassion, and to persuade
you to be contented with the punishment which has already been
inflicted. For since there are many inhuman persons amongst us who
are inclined, perhaps, to find fault with me for having admitted
him to the sanctuary, I parade his sufferings from a desire to
soften their hardheartedness by my narrative.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xv.iii-p11">For tell me, beloved brother, wherefore art
thou indignant with me? You say it is because he who continually
made war upon the Church has taken refuge within it. Yet surely we
ought in the highest degree to glorify God, for permitting him to
be placed in such a great strait as to experience both the power
and the lovingkindness of the Church:—her power in that he has
suffered this great vicissitude in consequence of the attacks which
he made upon her: her lovingkindness in that she whom he attacked
now casts her shield in front of him and has received him under her
wings, and placed him in all security not resenting any of her
former injuries, but most lovingly opening her bosom to him. For
this is more glorious than any kind of trophy, this is a brilliant
victory, this puts both Gentiles and Jews to shame, this displays
the bright aspect of the Church: in that having received her enemy
as a captive, she spares him, and when all have despised him in his
desolation, she alone like an affectionate mother has concealed him
under her cloak,<note place="end" n="808" id="xv.iii-p11.1"><p class="endnote" id="xv.iii-p12"> Possibly an allusion to the curtain which in
Eastern Churches, was drawn in front of the altar.</p></note> opposing
both the wrath of the king, and the rage of the people, and their
overwhelming hatred. This is an ornament for the altar. A strange
kind of ornament, you say, when the accused sinner, the
extortioner, the robber is permitted to lay hold of the altar. Nay!
say not so: for even the harlot took hold of the feet of Jesus, she
who was stained with the most accursed and unclean sin: yet her
deed was no reproach to 
<pb n="251" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_251.html" id="xv.iii-Page_251" />Jesus, but rather redounded to His
admiration and praise: for the impure woman did no injury to Him
who was pure, but rather was the vile harlot rendered pure by the
touch of Him who was the pure and spotless one. Grudge not then, O
man. We are the servants of the crucified one who said “Forgive
them for they know not what they do.”<note place="end" n="809" id="xv.iii-p12.1"><p class="endnote" id="xv.iii-p13"> <scripRef passage="Luke xxiii. 34" id="xv.iii-p13.1" parsed="|Luke|23|34|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.23.34">Luke
xxiii. 34</scripRef>.</p></note> But, you say, he cut off the right
of refuge here by his ordinances and divers kinds of laws. Yes! yet
now he has learned by experience what it was he did, and he himself
by his own deeds has been the first to break the law, and has
become a spectacle to the whole world, and silent though he is, he
utters from thence a warning voice to all, saying “do not such
things as I have done, that ye suffer not such things as I
suffer.” He appears as a teacher by means of his calamity, and
the altar emits great lustre, inspiring now the greatest awe from
the fact that it holds the lion in bondage; for any figure of
royalty might be very much set off if the king were not only to be
seen seated on his throne arrayed in purple and wearing his crown,
but if also prostrate at the feet of the king barbarians with their
hands bound behind their backs were bending low their heads. And
that no persuasive arguments have been used, ye yourselves are
witnesses of the enthusiasm, and the concourse of the people. For
brilliant indeed is the scene before us to day, and magnificent the
assembly, and I see as large a gathering here to-day as at the Holy
Paschal Feast. Thus the man has summoned you here without speaking
and yet uttering a voice through his actions clearer than the sound
of a trumpet: and ye have all thronged hither to-day, maidens
deserting their boudoirs, and matrons the women’s chambers, and
men the market place that ye may see human nature convicted, and
the instability of worldly affairs exposed, and the harlot-face
which a few days ago was radiant (such is the prosperity derived
from extortion) looking uglier than any wrinkled old woman, this
face I say you may see denuded of its enamel and pigments by the
action of adversity as by a sponge.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xv.iii-p14">4. Such is the force of this calamity: it has
made one who was illustrious and conspicuous appear the most
insignificant of men. And if a rich man should enter the assembly
he derives much profit from the sight: for when he beholds the man
who was shaking the whole world, now dragged down from so high a
pinnacle of power, cowering with fright, more terrified than a hare
or a frog, nailed fast to yonder pillar, without bonds, his fear
serving instead of a chain, panic-stricken and trembling, he abates
his haughtiness, he puts down his pride, and having acquired the
kind of wisdom concerning human affairs which it concerns him to
have he departs instructed by example in the lesson which Holy
Scripture teaches by precept:—“All flesh is grass and all the
glory of man as the flower of grass: the grass withereth and the
flower faileth”<note place="end" n="810" id="xv.iii-p14.1"><p class="endnote" id="xv.iii-p15"> <scripRef passage="Is. xl. 6, 7" id="xv.iii-p15.1" parsed="|Isa|40|6|40|7" osisRef="Bible:Isa.40.6-Isa.40.7">Is. xl. 6,

shall wither away quickly as the grass, and as the green herb shall
they quickly fail”<note place="end" n="811" id="xv.iii-p15.2"><p class="endnote" id="xv.iii-p16"> <scripRef passage="Ps. xxxvii. 2" id="xv.iii-p16.1" parsed="|Ps|37|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.37.2">Ps.

4</scripRef>.</p></note> and all
passages of that kind. Again the poor man when he has entered and
gazed at this spectacle does not think meanly of himself, nor
bewail himself on account of his poverty, but feels grateful to his
poverty, because it is a place of refuge to him, and a calm haven,
and secure bulwark; and when he sees these things he would many
times rather remain where he is, than enjoy the possession of all
men for a little time and afterwards be in jeopardy of his own
life. Seest thou how the rich and poor, high and low, bond and free
have derived no small profit from this man’s taking refuge here?
Seest thou how each man will depart hence with a remedy, being
cured merely by this sight? Well! have I softened your passion, and
expelled your wrath? have I extinguished your cruelty? have I
induced you to be pitiful? Indeed I think I have; and your
countenances and the streams of tears you shed are proofs of it.
Since then your hard rock has turned into deep and fertile soil let
us hasten to produce some fruit of mercy, and to display a
luxuriant crop of pity by falling down before the Emperor or rather
by imploring the merciful God so to soften the rage of the Emperor,
and make his heart tender that he may grant the whole of the favour
which we ask. For indeed already since that day when this man fled
here for refuge no slight change has taken place; for as soon as
the Emperor knew that he had hurried to this asylum, although the
army was present, and incensed on account of his misdeeds, and
demanded him to be given up for execution, the Emperor made a long
speech endeavouring to allay the rage of the soldiers, maintaining
that not only his offences, but any good deed which he might have
done ought to be taken into account, declaring that he felt
gratitude for the latter, and was prepared to forgive him as a
fellow creature for deeds which were otherwise. And when they again
urged him to avenge the insult done to the imperial majesty,
shouting, leaping, and brandishing their spears, he shed streams of
tears from his gentle eyes, and having reminded them of the Holy
Table <pb n="252" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_252.html" id="xv.iii-Page_252" />to which the man
had fled for refuge he succeeded at last in appeasing their
wrath.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xv.iii-p18">5. Moreover let me add some arguments which
concern ourselves. For what pardon could you deserve, if the
Emperor bears no resentment when he has been insulted, but ye who
have experienced nothing of this kind display so much wrath? and

upon your debtor? Has he inflicted great wrongs and insults on you?
I will not deny it. Yet this is the season not for judgment but for
mercy; not for requiring an account, but for showing loving
kindness: not for investigating claims but for conceding them; not
for verdicts and vengeance, but for mercy and favour. Let no one
then be irritated or vexed, but let us rather beseech the merciful
God to grant him a respite from death, and to rescue him from this
impending destruction, so that he may put off his transgression,
and let us unite to approach the merciful Emperor beseeching him
for the sake of the Church, for the sake of the altar, to concede
the life of one man as an offering to the Holy Table. If we do this
the Emperor himself will accept us, and even before his praise we
shall have the approval of God, who will bestow a large recompense
upon us for our mercy. For as he rejects and hates the cruel and
inhuman, so does He welcome and love the merciful and humane man;
and if such a man be righteous, all the more glorious is the crown
which is wreathed for him: and if he be a sinner, He passes over
his sins granting this as the reward of compassion shown to his
fellow-servant. “For” He saith “I will have mercy and not
sacrifice,”<note place="end" n="814" id="xv.iii-p19.2"><p class="endnote" id="xv.iii-p20"> <scripRef id="xv.iii-p20.1"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="xv.iii-p20.2"><scripRef passage="Hosea vi. 6" id="xv.iii-p20.3" parsed="|Hos|6|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Hos.6.6">Hosea vi. 6</scripRef></span></scripRef></p></note> and
throughout the Scriptures you find Him always enquiring after this,
and declaring it to be the means of release from sin. Thus then we
shall dispose Him to be propitious to us, thus we shall release
ourselves from our sins, thus we shall adorn the Church, thus also
our merciful Emperor, as I have already said, will commend us, and
all the people will applaud us, and the ends of the earth will
admire the humanity and gentleness of our city, and all who hear of
these deeds throughout the world will extol us. That we then may
enjoy these good things, let us fall down in prayer and
supplication, let us rescue the captive, the fugitive, the
suppliant from danger that we ourselves may obtain the future
blessings by the favour and mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom
be glory and power, now and for ever, world without end.
Amen.</p>

<p class="c9" id="xv.iv-p3">1. <span class="c12" id="xv.iv-p3.1">Delectable</span> indeed
are the meadow, and the garden, but far more delectable the study
of the divine writings. For there indeed are flowers which fade,
but here are thoughts which abide in full bloom; there is the
breeze of the zephyr, but here the breath of the Spirit: there is
the hedge of thorns, but here is the guarding providence of God;
there is the song of cicadæ, but here the melody of the prophets:
there is the pleasure which comes from sight, but here the profit
which comes from study. The garden is confined to one place, but
the Scriptures are in all parts of the world; the garden is subject
to the necessities of the seasons, but the Scriptures are rich in
foliage, and laden with fruit alike in winter and in summer. Let us
then give diligent heed to the study of the Scriptures: for if thou
doest this the Scripture will expel thy despondency, and engender
pleasure, extirpate vice, and make virtue take root, and in the
tumult of life it will save thee from suffering like those who are
tossed by troubled waves. The sea rages but thou sailest on with
calm weather; for thou hast the study of the Scriptures for thy
pilot; for this is the cable which the trials of life do not break
asunder. Now that I lie not events themselves bear witness. A few
days ago the Church was besieged: an army came, and fire issued
from their eyes, yet it did not scorch the olive tree; swords were
unsheathed, yet no one received a wound; the imperial gates were in
distress, but the Church was in security. And yet the tide
of <pb n="253" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_253.html" id="xv.iv-Page_253" />war flowed
hither; for here the refugee was sought, and we withstood them, not
fearing their rage. And wherefore prithee? because we held as a
sure pledge the saying “Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will
build my Church: and the gates of hell shall not prevail against
it.”<note place="end" n="815" id="xv.iv-p3.2"><p class="endnote" id="xv.iv-p4"> <scripRef passage="Matt. xvi. 18" id="xv.iv-p4.1" parsed="|Matt|16|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.16.18">Matt. xvi.

the Church he would not have been surrendered. Do not say that he
fled here for refuge and then was given up: the Church did not
abandon him but he abandoned the Church. He was not surrendered
from within the Church but outside its walls. Wherefore did he
forsake the Church? Didst thou desire to save thyself? Thou
shouldst have held fast to the altar. There were no walls here, but
there was the guarding providence of God. Wast thou a sinner? God
does not reject thee: for “He came not to call the righteous but
sinners to repentance.”<note place="end" n="817" id="xv.iv-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="xv.iv-p7"> <scripRef passage="Matt. ix. 13" id="xv.iv-p7.1" parsed="|Matt|9|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.9.13">Matt. ix.

to His feet. Have ye heard the passage read to-day? Now I say these
things that thou mayest not hesitate to take refuge in the Church.
Abide with the Church, and the Church does not hand thee over to
the enemy: but if thou fliest from the Church, the Church is not
the cause of thy capture. For if thou art inside the fold the wolf
does not enter: but if thou goest outside, thou art liable to be
the wild beast’s prey: yet this is not the fault of the fold, but
of thy own pusillanimity. The Church hath no feet. Talk not to me
of walls and arms: for walls wax old with time, but the Church has
no old age. Walls are shattered by barbarians, but over the Church
even demons do not prevail. And that my words are no mere vaunt
there is the evidence of facts. How many have assailed the Church,
and yet the assailants have perished while the Church herself has
soared beyond the sky? Such might hath the Church: when she is
assailed she conquers: when snares are laid for her she prevails:
when she is insulted her prosperity increases: she is wounded yet
sinks not under her wounds; tossed by waves yet not submerged;
vexed by storms yet suffers no shipwreck; she wrestles and is not
worsted, fights but is not vanquished. Wherefore then did she
suffer this war to be? That she might make more manifest the
splendour of her triumph. Ye were present on that day, and ye saw
what weapons were set in motion against her, and how the rage of
the soldiers burned more fiercely than fire, and I was hurried away
to the imperial palace.<note place="end" n="818" id="xv.iv-p7.2"><p class="endnote" id="xv.iv-p8"> See Introduction.</p></note> But what of that? By the grace of

the occasion of the contest was sufficient for encouragement and
consolation. True! I was being forcibly dragged away, but I
suffered no insult from the act; for there is only one real insult,
namely sin: and should the whole world insult thee, yet if thou
dost not insult thyself thou art not insulted. The only real
betrayal is the betrayal of the conscience: betray not thy own
conscience, and no one can betray thee. I was being dragged away
and I saw the events—or rather I saw my words turned into events,
I saw my discourse which I had uttered in words being preached in
the market-place through the medium of actual events. What kind of
discourse? the same which I was always repeating. The wind has
blown and the leaves have fallen. “The grass has withered and the
flower has faded.”<note place="end" n="822" id="xv.iv-p12.2"><p class="endnote" id="xv.iv-p13"> <scripRef passage="Is. xl. 8" id="xv.iv-p13.1" parsed="|Isa|40|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.40.8">Is. xl.

were taking place were a lesson. And I said to myself will
posterity learn self-control? or before two days have passed by

were sounding in their ears. Again let me utter, yet again I will
speak. What profit will there be? Certainly there will be profit.

<p class="c10" id="xv.iv-p15">3. Have ye seen the insignificance of human
affairs? have ye seen the frailty of power? Have ye seen the wealth
which I always called a runaway and not a runaway only, but also a
murderer. For it not only deserts those who possess it, but also
slaughters them; for when any one pays court to it then most of all
does it betray him. Why dost thou pay court to wealth which to-day
is for thee, and to-morrow for another? Why dost thou court wealth
which can never be held fast? Dost thou desire to court it? dost
thou desire to hold it fast? Do not bury it but give it into the
hands of the poor. For wealth is a wild beast: if it be tightly
held it runs away: if it be let loose it remains where it is;
“For,” it is said, “he hath dispersed abroad and given to the
poor; his righteousness remaineth forever.”<note place="end" n="824" id="xv.iv-p15.1"><p class="endnote" id="xv.iv-p16"> <scripRef passage="Ps. cxii. 9" id="xv.iv-p16.1" parsed="|Ps|12|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.12.9">Ps. cxii.
9</scripRef>.</p></note> Disperse it then that it may remain
with thee; bury it not lest it run away. Where is wealth? I would
gladly enquire of those who have departed. Now I say these things
not by way of reproach, God forbid, nor by way of irritating old
sores, but as endeavouring to secure a haven for you out of the
shipwreck of others. When soldiers and swords were threatening,
when the city was in a blaze of fury, when the imperial majesty was
powerless, and the purple was insulted, when all places were full
of frenzy, where was wealth then? where was your silver plate?
where were your silver couches? where your household slaves? they
had all betaken themselves to flight; where were the eunuchs? they
all ran away; where were your friends? they changed their masks.
Where were your houses? they were shut up. Where was your money?
the owner of it fled: and the money itself, where was that? it was
buried. Where was it all hidden? Am I oppressive and irksome to you
in constantly declaring that wealth betrays those who use it badly?
The occasion has now come which proves the truth of my words. Why
dost thou hold it so tightly, when in the time of trial it
profiteth thee nothing? If it has power when thou fallest into a
strait, let it come to thy aid, but if it then runs away what need
hast thou of it? events themselves bear witness. What profit was
there in it? The sword was whetted, death was impending, an army
raging: there was apprehension of imminent peril; and yet wealth
was nowhere to be seen. Where did the runaway flee? It was itself
the cause which brought about all these evils, and yet in the hours
of necessity it runs away. Nevertheless many reproach me saying
continually thou fasteneth upon the rich: while they on the other
hand fasten upon the poor. Well I do fasten upon the rich: or
rather not the rich, but those who make a bad use of their riches.
For I am continually saying that I do not attack the character of
the rich man, but of the rapacious. A rich man is one thing, a
rapacious man is another: an affluent man is one thing, a covetous
man is another. Make clear distinctions, and do not confuse things
which are diverse. Art thou a rich man? I forbid thee not. Art thou
a rapacious man? I denounce thee. Hast thou property of thy own?
enjoy it. Dost thou take the property of others? I will not hold my
peace. Wouldest thou stone me for this? I am ready to shed my
blood: only I forbid thy sin. I heed not hatred, I heed not war:
one thing only do I heed, the advancement of my hearers. The rich
are my children, and the poor also are my children: the same womb
has travailed with both, both are the offspring of the same
travail-pangs. If then thou fastenest reproaches on the poor man, I
denounce thee: for the poor man does not suffer so much loss as the
rich. For no great wrong is inflicted on the poor man, seeing that
in his case the injury is confined to money; but in thy case the
injury touches the soul. Let him who wills cast me off, let him who
wills stone me, let him who wills hate me: for the plots of enemies
are the pledges to me of crowns of victory, and the number of my
rewards will be as the number of my wounds.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xv.iv-p17">4. So then I fear not an enemy’s plots: one thing
only do I fear, which is sin. If no one convicts me of sin, then
let the whole world make war upon me. For this kind of war only
renders me more prosperous. Thus also do I wish to teach you a
lesson. Fear not the devices of a potentate, but fear the power of
sin. No man will do thee harm, if thou dost not deal a blow to
thyself. If thou hast not sin, ten thousand swords may threaten
thee, but God will snatch thee away out of their reach: but if thou
hast sin, even shouldest thou be in paradise thou wilt be cast out.
Adam was in paradise yet he fell; Job was on a dung hill, yet he
was crowned victorious. What profit was paradise to the one? or
what injury was the dung hill to the other? No man laid snares for
the one, yet was he overthrown: the devil laid snares for the
other, and yet he was crowned. Did not the devil take <pb n="255" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_255.html" id="xv.iv-Page_255" />his property? Yes, but he did not rob
him of his godliness. Did he not lay violent hands upon his sons?
yes: but he did not shake his faith. Did he not tear his body to
pieces? yes but he did not find his treasure. Did he not arm his
wife against him? yes but he did not overthrow the soldier. Did he
not hurl arrows and darts at him? yes but he received no wounds. He
advanced his engines but could not shake the tower; he conducted
his billows against him, but did not sink the ship. Observe this
law I beseech you, yea I clasp your knees, if not with the bodily
hand, yet in spirit, and pour forth tears of supplication. Observe
this law I pray you, and no one can do you harm. Never call the
rich man happy; never call any man miserable save him who is living
in sin: and call him happy who lives in righteousness. For it is
not the nature of their circumstances, but the disposition of the
men which makes both the one and the other. Never be afraid of the
sword if thy conscience does not accuse thee: never be afraid in
war if thy conscience is clear. Where are they who have departed?
tell me. Did not all men once bow down to them? did not those who
were in authority tremble greatly before them? did they not pay
court to them? But sin has come, and all things are manifested in
their true lights; they who were attendants have become judges, the
flatterers are turned into executioners; they who once kissed his
hands, dragged him themselves from the church, and he who yesterday
kissed his hand is to-day his enemy. Wherefore? Because neither did
he yesterday love him with sincerity. For the opportunity came and
the actors were unmasked. Didst thou not yesterday kiss his hands,
and call him saviour, and guardian, and benefactor? Didst thou not
compose panegyrics without end? wherefore to-day dost thou accuse
him? Why yesterday a praiser, and to-day an accuser? why yesterday
utter panegyrics, and to-day reproaches? What means this change?
what means this revolution?</p>

<p class="c10" id="xv.iv-p18">5. But I am not like this: I was the subject
of his plots, yet I became his protector. I suffered countless
troubles at his hands, yet I did not retaliate. For I copy the
example of my Master, who said on the cross, “Forgive them, for
they know not what they do.” Now I say these things that you may
not be perverted by the suspicion of wicked men. Now many changes
have taken place, since I had the oversight of the city, and yet no
one learns self-control? But when I say no one, I do not condemn
all, God forbid. For it is impossible that this rich soil when it
has received seed, should not produce one ear of corn: but I am
insatiable, I do not wish many to be saved but all. And if but one
be left in a perishing condition, I perish also, and deem that the
Shepherd should be imitated who had ninety-nine sheep, and yet
hastened after the one which had gone astray.<note place="end" n="825" id="xv.iv-p18.1"><p class="endnote" id="xv.iv-p19"> <scripRef passage="Luke xv. 4" id="xv.iv-p19.1" parsed="|Luke|15|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.15.4">Luke xv.

and that. No one has a city. The city is above. Present life is but
a journey. We are journeying on every day, while nature is running
its course. Some there are who store up goods on the way: some who
bury jewellery on the road. Now when you enter an inn do you
beautify the inn? not so, but you eat and drink and hasten to
depart. The present life is an inn: we have entered it, and we
bring present life to a close: let us be eager to depart with a
good hope, let us leave nothing here, that we may not lose it
there. When you enter the inn, what do you say to the servant? Take
care where you put away our things, that you do not leave anything
behind here, that nothing may be lost, not even what is small and
trifling, in order that we may carry everything back to our home.
Thou art a wayfarer and traveller, and indeed more insignificant
than the wayfarer. How so? I will tell you. The wayfarer knows when
he is going into the inn, and when he is going out; for the egress
as well as the regress is in his own power: but when I enter the
inn, that is to say this present life, I know not when I shall go
out: and it may be that I am providing myself with sustenance for a
long time when the Master suddenly summons me saying “Thou fool,

says “lay hold of me; I thank thee for it, lay hold of my kingdom
and take it by violence.” If thou art minded to lay hold of an
earthly kingdom, or rather if thou art minded to have designs upon
it thou art punished; but in the case of the heavenly kingdom thou
art punished if thou dost not lay hold of it. Where worldly things
are concerned there is ill-will, but where spiritual there is love.
Meditate daily on these things, and if two days hence thou seest
another riding in a chariot, arrayed in raiment of silk, and elated
with pride, be not again dismayed and troubled. Praise not a rich
man, but only him who lives in righteousness. Revile not a poor
man, but learn to have an upright and accurate judgment in all
things.</p>

it with the Church itself: does one name suffice to present the
whole truth? by no means. But for this reason there are countless
names, that we may learn something concerning God, though it be but
a small part. Even so the Church also is called by many names. She
is called a virgin, albeit formerly she was an harlot: for this is
the miracle wrought by the Bridegroom, that He took her who was an
harlot and hath made her a virgin. Oh! what a new and strange
event! With us marriage destroys virginity, but with God marriage
hath restored it. With us she who is a virgin, when married, is a
virgin no longer: with Christ she who is an harlot, when married,
becomes a virgin.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xv.iv-p36">7. Let the heretic who inquires curiously into
the nature of heavenly generation saying “how did the Father
beget the Son?” interpret this single fact, ask him how did the
Church, being an harlot, become a virgin? and how did she having
brought forth children remain a virgin? “For I am jealous over
you,” saith Paul, “with a godly jealousy, for I espoused you to
one husband that I might present you as a pure virgin to
Christ.”<note place="end" n="839" id="xv.iv-p36.1"><p class="endnote" id="xv.iv-p37"> <scripRef passage="2 Cor. xi. 2" id="xv.iv-p37.1" parsed="|2Cor|11|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.11.2">2 Cor. xi.

of love, and earnest zeal. I am jealous over you with the jealousy
of God. Shall I tell thee how He manifests His jealousy? He saw the
world corrupted by devils, and He delivered His own Son to save it.
For words spoken in reference to God have not the same force as
when spoken in reference to ourselves: for instance we say God is
jealous, God is wroth, God repents, God hates. These words are

the expressions: but grasp their divine meaning. God is
jealous, <pb n="257" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_257.html" id="xv.iv-Page_257" />for He loves,
God is wroth, not as yielding to passion, but for the purpose of
chastising, and punishing. God sleeps, not as really slumbering,
but as being long-suffering. Choose out the expression. Thus when
thou hearest that God begets the Son, think not of division but of
the unity of substance. For God has taken many of these words from
us as we also have borrowed others from Him, that we may receive
honour thereby.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xv.iv-p43">8. Dost thou understand what I have said?
Attend carefully my beloved. There are divine names, and there are
human names. God has received from me, and He Himself hath given to
me. Give me thine, and take mine He says. Thou hast need of mine: I
have no need of thine, but thou hast of mine inasmuch as my nature
is unmixed, but thou art a human being encompassed with a body,
seeking also corporeal terms in order that, by borrowing
expressions which are familiar to thee, thou who art thus
encompassed with a body, mayest be able to think on thoughts which
transcend thy understanding. What kind of names hath He received
from me, and what kind hath He given to me? He Himself is God, and
He hath called me God; with Him is the essential nature as an
actual fact, with me only the honour of the name: “I have said ye
are gods, and ye are all children of the most highest.”<note place="end" n="845" id="xv.iv-p43.1"><p class="endnote" id="xv.iv-p44"> <scripRef passage="Psa. 82.6; John 10.34" id="xv.iv-p44.1" parsed="|Ps|82|6|0|0;|John|10|34|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.82.6 Bible:John.10.34">Ps. lxxxii. 6; comp.

words, but in the other case there is the actual reality. He hath
called me god, for by that name I have received honour. He Himself
was called man, he was called Son of man, he was called the Way,
the Door, the Rock. These words He borrowed from me; the others He
gave from Himself to me. Wherefore was He called the Way? That thou
mightest understand that by Him we have access to the Father.
Wherefore was He called the Rock? that thou mightest understand the
secure and unshaken character of the faith. Wherefore was He called
the Foundation? That thou mightest understand that He upholdeth all
things. Wherefore was He called the Root? That thou mightest
understand that in Him we have our power of growth. Wherefore was
He called the Shepherd? Because He feeds us. Wherefore was He
called a sheep? Because He was sacrificed for us and became a
propitiatory offering. Wherefore was He called the Life? Because He
raised us up when we were dead. Wherefore was He called the Light?
Because He delivered us from darkness. Why was He called an Arm?
Because He is of one substance with the Father. Why was He called
the Word? Because He was begotten of the Father. For as my word is
the offspring of my spirit, even so was the Son begotten of the
Father. Wherefore is He called our raiment? Because I was clothed
with Him when I was baptized. Why is He called a table? Because I
feed upon Him when I partake of the mysteries. Why is He called a
house? Because I dwell in Him. Why is He called an inmate of the
house? Because we become His Temple. Wherefore is He called the
Head? Because I have been made a member of His. Why is He called a
Bridegroom? Because He hath taken me as His bride. Wherefore is He
called undefiled? Because He took me as a virgin. Wherefore is He
called Master? Because I am His bondmaid.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xv.iv-p45">9. For observe the Church, how, as I was
saying, she is sometimes a bride, sometimes a daughter, sometimes a
virgin, sometimes a bondmaid, sometimes a queen, sometimes a barren
woman, sometimes a mountain, sometimes a garden, sometimes fruitful
in children, sometimes a lily, sometimes a fountain: She is all
things. Therefore having heard these things, think not I pray you
that they are corporeal; but stretch thy thought further: for such
things cannot be corporeal. For example: the mountain is not the
maid: the maid is not the bride: the queen is not the bond-maid:
yet the Church is all these things. Wherefore? because the element
in which they exist is not corporeal but spiritual. For in a
corporeal sphere these things are confined within narrow limits:
but in a spiritual sphere they have a wide field of operation.

and discern those which belong to the Dispensation. Understand what
He <i>was,</i> and what He <i>became</i> for thy sake, and do not
confuse things which are distinct, nor make the argument of his
lovingkindness an occasion for blasphemy. He was lofty, and she was
lowly: lofty not by position but by nature. His essence was pure,
and imperishable: His nature was incorruptible, unintelligible,
invisible, incomprehensible, eternal, unchangeable, transcending
the nature of angels, higher than the powers above, overpowering
reason, surpassing thought, apprehended not by sight but by faith
alone. Angels beheld Him and trembled, the Cheru<pb n="258" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_258.html" id="xv.iv-Page_258" />bim veiled themselves with

power, if indeed it is safe even to use such expressions. But what
am I to do? I am a human being and I speak in human language: my
tongue is of earth and I crave forgiveness from my Lord. For I do
not use these expressions in a spirit of presumption, but on
account of the poverty of my resources arising from my feebleness
and the nature of our human tongue. Be merciful to me, O Lord, for
I utter these words not in presumption but because I have no
others: nevertheless I do not rest content with the meanness of my
speech, but soar upwards on the wings of my understanding. Such is
His greatness and power. I say this, that without dwelling on the
words, or on the poverty of the expressions, thou mayest also
thyself learn to act in the same way. Why dost thou marvel if I do
this, inasmuch as He also does the same, when He wishes to present
something to our minds which transcends human powers? Since He
addresses human beings He uses also human illustration, which are
indeed insufficient to represent the thing spoken of, and cannot
exhibit the full proportions of the matter, yet suffice for the
infirmity of the hearers.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xv.iv-p50">10. Make an effort, and do not grow weary of
my prolonged discourse. For as when He manifests Himself, He is not
manifested as He really is, nor is His bare essence manifested (for
no man hath seen God in His real nature; for when He is but
partially revealed the Cherubim tremble—the mountains smoke, the
sea is dried up, the heaven is shaken, and if the revelation were
not partial who could endure it?) as then, I say, He does not
manifest Himself as He really is, but only as the beholder is able
to see Him, therefore doth He appear sometimes in the form of old
age, sometimes of youth, sometimes in fire, sometimes in air,
sometimes in water, sometimes in armour, not altering his essential
nature, but fashioning His appearance to suit the various condition
of those who are affected by it. In like manner also when any one
wishes to say anything concerning Him he employs human
illustrations. For instance I say: “He went up into the mountain
and He was transfigured before them, and His countenance shone as
the sun, and His raiment became white as snow.”<note place="end" n="850" id="xv.iv-p50.1"><p class="endnote" id="xv.iv-p51"> <scripRef passage="Matt. xvii. 2: Mark ix. 2" id="xv.iv-p51.1">Matt.
xvii. 2: Mark ix. 2</scripRef>.
Chrysostom mixes up the accounts of the two Evangelists, and does
not quote the exact words of either.</p></note> He disclosed, it is said, a little
of the Godhead, He manifested to them the God dwelling amongst them
“and He was transfigured before them.” Attend carefully to the
statement. The writer says and He was transfigured before them, and
His raiment shone as the light, and His countenance was as the sun.
When I said “such is His greatness and power” and added “be
merciful to me O Lord,” (for I do not rest satisfied with the
expression but am perplexed, having no other framed for the
purpose) I wish you to understand, that I learned this lesson from
Holy Scripture. The evangelist then wished to describe His
splendour and he says “He shone.” How did He shine? tell me.
Exceedingly. And how do you express this? He shone “as the
sun.” As the sun sayest thou? Yea. Wherefore? Because I know not
any other luminary more brilliant. And He was white sayest thou as
snow? wherefore as snow? Because I know not any other substance
which is whiter. For that He did not really shine thus is proved by
what follows: the disciples fell to the ground. If he had shone as
the sun the disciples would not have fallen; for they saw the sun
every day, and did not fall: but inasmuch as he shone more
brilliantly than the sun or snow, they, being unable to bear the
splendour, fell to the earth.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xv.iv-p52">11. Tell me then, O evangelist, did He shine more
brightly than the sun, and yet dost thou say, “as the sun?”
Yea: wishing to make that light known to thee, I know not any other
greater luminary, I have no other comparison which holds a royal
place amongst luminaries. I have said these things that thou mayest
not rest contentedly in the poverty of the language used: I have
pointed out to thee the fall of the disciples: they fell to the
earth, and were stupified and overwhelmed with slumber. “Arise”
He said, and lifted them up, and yet they were oppressed. For they
could not endure the excessive brightness of that shining, but
heavy sleep took possession of their eyes: so far did the light
which was manifested exceed the light of the sun. Yet the
evangelist said “as the sun,” because that luminary is familiar
to us and surpasses all the rest.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xv.iv-p53">But as I was saying, He who was thus great and
powerful desired an harlot. I speak of our human nature under that
name. If a man indeed desire an harlot he is condemned, and doth
God desire one? Yea verily. Again a 
<pb n="259" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_259.html" id="xv.iv-Page_259" />man desireth an harlot that he may become a
fornicator: but God that He may convert the harlot into a virgin:
so that the desire of the man is the destruction of her who is
desired: but the desire of God is salvation to her who is desired.
And why did He who is so great and powerful desire an harlot? that
He might become the husband thereof. How doth He act? He doth not
send to her any of His servants, He sendeth not angel, archangel,
Cherubim, or Seraphim; but He himself draws nigh Who loves her.
Again when thou hearest of love, deem it not sensuous. Cull out the
thoughts which are contained in the words, even as an excellent bee
settles on the flowers, and takes the honey comb, but leaves the
herbs God desired an harlot, and how doth He act? He does not
conduct her on high; for He would not bring an harlot into Heaven,
but He Himself comes down. Since she could not ascend on high, He
descends to earth. He cometh to the harlot, and is not ashamed: He
cometh to her secret dwelling place. He beholds her in her
drunkenness. And how doth He come? not in the bare essence of His
original nature, but He becomes that which the harlot was, not in
intention but in reality does He become this, in order that she may
not be scared when she sees Him, that she may not rush away, and
escape. He cometh to the harlot, and becomes man. And how does He
become this? He is conceived in the womb, he increases little by
little and follows like me the course of human growth. Who is it
who does this? the Deity as manifested, not the Godhead; the form
of the servant not that of the Master; the flesh which belongs to
me, not the essential nature which belongs to Him: He increases
little by little, and has intercourse with mankind. Although He
finds the harlot, human nature, full of sores, brutalised, and
oppressed by devils, how does He act? He draws nigh to her. She
sees Him and flees away. He calleth the wise men saying Why are ye
afraid? I am not a judge, but a physician. “I came not to judge
the world but to save the world.”<note place="end" n="851" id="xv.iv-p53.1"><p class="endnote" id="xv.iv-p54"> <scripRef passage="John xii. 47" id="xv.iv-p54.1" parsed="|John|12|47|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.12.47">John xii.

men. Oh! new and strange event. The immediate first-fruits of His
coming are wise men. He who upholds the world lieth in a manger,
and He who careth for all things is a nursling in swaddling bands.
The temple is founded and the God dwelleth therein. And wise men
come and straightway worship Him: the publican comes and is turned
into an evangelist: the harlot comes and is turned into a maiden:
the Canaanitish woman comes and partakes of his lovingkindness.
This is the mark of one who loves, to forbear demanding an account
of sins, and to forgive transgressions and offences. And how does
He act? He takes the sinner and espouses her to himself. And what
doth He give her? a signet ring. Of what nature? the Holy Spirit.

thee in myself, I uphold thee. How? The devil dares not approach

clay, and it was perverted. I remodel it by means of the laver of
regeneration and I submit it to the action of fire.” For observe:
He took dust from the earth and made the man; He formed him. The
devil came, and perverted him. Then the Lord came, took him again,
and remoulded, and recast him in baptism, and He suffered not his
body to be of clay, but made it of a harder ware. He subjected the

shattered. “A day and a night have I been in the deep.” He hath
been in the deep, and the earthen vessel was not dissolved: he
suffered shipwreck and the treasure was not lost; the ship was

righteousness, sanctification, redemption. Of what nature, tell me?

<p class="c10" id="xv.iv-p65">12. Hast thou seen a treasure more brilliant
than royal treasures? For what can the pearl of a king do like that
which the words of an Apostle effected? Set crowns innumerable upon
dead men, and they will not be raised: but one word went forth from
an Apostle, and it brought back revoked nature, and restored it to
its ancient condition. “But we have this treasure.” O treasure
which not only is preserved, but also preserves the house where it
is stored up. Dost thou understand what I have said? The kings of
the earth, and rulers when they have treasures, prepare large
houses, having strong walls, bars, doors, guards, and bolts in
order that the treasure may be preserved: but Christ did the
contrary: He placed the treasure not in a stone vessel but in an
earthen one. If the treasure is great wherefore is the vessel weak?
But the reason why the vessel is weak is not because the treasure
is great; for this is not preserved by the vessel, but itself
preserves the vessel. I deposit the treasure: who is able
henceforth to steal it? The devil has come, the world has come,
multitudes have come, and yet they have not stolen the treasure:
the vessel has been scourged, yet the treasure was not betrayed; it
has been drowned in the sea, yet the treasure was not shipwrecked:
it has died yet the treasure survives. He gave therefore the
earnest of the Spirit. Where are they who blaspheme the Spirit’s
majesty? Give ye heed. “He that establisheth us with you in
Christ is God who also hath given the earnest of the Spirit.”<note place="end" n="862" id="xv.iv-p65.1"><p class="endnote" id="xv.iv-p66"> <scripRef passage="2 Cor. i. 21, 22" id="xv.iv-p66.1" parsed="|2Cor|1|21|1|22" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.1.21-2Cor.1.22">2 Cor. i.
21, 22</scripRef>.</p></note> You all know
that the earnest is a small part of the whole; let me tell you how.
Some one goes to buy a house at a great price; and he says “give
me an earnest that I may have confidence: or one goes to take a
wife for himself, he arranges about dowry and property, and he says
“give me an earnest.” Observe: in the purchase of a slave and
in all covenants there is an earnest. Since then Christ made a
covenant with us (for He was about to take me as a bride) he also
assigned a dowry to me not of money, but of blood. But this dowry
which He assigns is the bestowal of good things “such as eye hath
not seen, and ear hath not heard, neither hath entered into the
heart of man.”<note place="end" n="863" id="xv.iv-p66.2"><p class="endnote" id="xv.iv-p67"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. ii. 9" id="xv.iv-p67.1" parsed="|1Cor|2|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.2.9">1 Cor. ii.

them for the dowry:—immortality, praise with the angels, release
from death, freedom from sin, the inheritance of a kingdom (so
great are his riches), righteousness, sanctification, deliverance
from present evils, discovery of future blessings. Great was my
dowry. Now attend carefully: mark what He does. He came to take the
harlot, for so I call her, unclean as she was, that thou mightest
understand the love of the bridegroom. He came; He took me: He
assigns me a dowry: He saith “I give thee my wealth.” How?
“Hast thou lost,” He saith, “paradise?” take it back. Hast
thou lost thy beauty? take it back; take all these things. But yet
the dowry was not given to me here.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xv.iv-p68">13. Observe, this is the reason why He speaks
beforehand with reference to this dowry; He warranted to me in the
dowry the resurrection of the body,—immortality. For immortality
does not always follow resurrection, but the two are distinct. For
many have risen, and been again laid low, like Lazarus and the
bodies of the saints.<note place="end" n="864" id="xv.iv-p68.1"><p class="endnote" id="xv.iv-p69"> <scripRef passage="John xi.; Matt. xxvii. 52" id="xv.iv-p69.1" parsed="|John|11|0|0|0;|Matt|27|52|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.11 Bible:Matt.27.52">John xi.;

from death, the freedom from sin, the complete overthrow of
destruction. Of what kind is that? “Eye hath not seen nor ear
heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which
God hath prepared for them that love Him.” Dost thou give me good
things which I know not? He saith “yea; only be espoused to me
here, love me in this world.” “Wherefore dost thou not give me
the dowry here?” “It will be given when thou hast come to my
Father, when thou hast entered the royal palace. Didst thou come to
me! <pb n="261" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_261.html" id="xv.iv-Page_261" />nay I came to
thee. I came not that thou shouldst abide here but that I might
take thee and return. Seek not the dowry here: all depends on hope,
and faith. “And dost thou give me nothing in this world?” He
answers. “Receive an earnest that thou mayest trust me concerning
that which is to come: receive pledges and betrothal gifts.”

us present blessings: they are an earnest of the future; but the
full dowry abides in the other world. How so? I will tell you. Here
I grow old, there I grow not old; here I die, there I die not, here
I sorrow, there I sorrow not; here is poverty, and disease, and
intrigue, there nothing of that kind exists: here is darkness and
light, there is light alone: here is intrigue, there is liberty;
here is disease, there is health; here is life which has an end,
there is life which hath no end; here is sin, there is
righteousness, and sin is banished; here is envy, there nothing of
the kind exists. “Give me these things” one says; “Nay! wait
in order that thy fellow-servants also may be saved; wait I say. He
who establisheth us and hath given us the earnest”—what kind of
earnest? the Holy Spirit, the supply of the Spirit. Let me speak
concerning the Spirit. He gave the signet ring to the Apostles,
saying “take this and give it to all.” Is the ring then
portioned out, and yet not divided? It is so. Let me teach you the
meaning of the supply of the Spirit: Peter received, and Paul also
received the Holy Spirit. He went about the world, he released
sinners from their sins, he restored the lame, he clothed the
naked, he raised the dead, he cleansed the lepers, he bridled the
devil, he strangled the demons, he held converse with God, he
planted a Church, levelled temples to the earth, overturned altars,
destroyed vice, established virtue, made angels of men.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xv.iv-p72">14. All these things we were. But “the
earnest” filled the whole world. And when I say the whole I mean
all which the sun shines upon, sea, islands, mountains, valleys,
and hills. Paul went hither and thither, like some winged creature,
with one mouth only contending against the enemy, he the tentmaker,
who handled the workman’s knife and sewed skins together: and yet
this his craft was no hindrance to his virtue, but the tentmaker
was stronger than demons, the uneloquent man was wiser than the
wise. Whence was this? He received the earnest, he bore the signet
ring and carried it about. All men saw that the King had espoused
our nature: the demon saw it and retreated, he saw the earnest, and
trembled and withdrew: he saw but the Apostle’s garments<note place="end" n="867" id="xv.iv-p72.1"><p class="endnote" id="xv.iv-p73"> <scripRef passage="Acts xix. 11" id="xv.iv-p73.1" parsed="|Acts|19|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.19.11">Acts xix.

the power of the Holy Spirit. He bestowed authority not on the
soul, nor on the body, but even on raiment; nor on raiment only but

demons, and raised the dead to life. Paul went about the world,
cutting away the thorns of ungodliness, sowing broadcast the seeds
of godliness, like an excellent ploughman handling the ploughshare
of doctrine. And to whom did he go? To Thracians, to Scythians, to
Indians, to Maurians, to Sardinians, to Goths, to wild savages, and
he changed them all. By what means? By means of “the earnest.”
How was he sufficient for these things? By the grace of the Spirit.
Unskilled, ill-clothed, ill-shod he was upheld by Him “who also
hath given the earnest of the Spirit.” Therefore he saith “and

unclean rites and mysteries, and sacrifices, everywhere demons
holding their orgies, everywhere a citadel of the devil, everywhere
fornication decked with wreaths of honour; and Paul stood alone.

I give thee now, and others I promise. Therefore the prophet saith
concerning her “The queen did stand upon thy right hand in a
vesture woven with gold.” He does not mean a real vesture, but
virtue. Therefore the Scripture elsewhere saith “How camest thou
in hither not having a wedding garment?” so that here he does not
mean a garment, but fornication, and foul and unclean living. As
then foul raiment signifies sin, so does golden raiment signify
virtue. But this raiment belonged to the king. He Himself bestowed
the raiment upon her: for she was naked, naked and disfigured.
“The queen stood on thy right hand in a vesture woven with
gold.”<note place="end" n="876" id="xv.iv-p81.2"><p class="endnote" id="xv.iv-p82"> <scripRef passage="Ps. xlv. 10" id="xv.iv-p82.1" parsed="|Ps|45|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.45.10">Ps. xlv.

speaking not of raiment but of virtue. Observe: the expression
itself has great nobility of meaning. He does not say “in a
vesture of gold” but “in a vesture woven with gold.” Listen
intelligently. A vesture of gold is one which is gold throughout:
but a vesture woven with gold is one which is partly of gold,
partly of silk. Why then did he say that the bride wore not a
vesture of gold, but one woven with gold? Attend carefully. He
means the constitution of the Church in its varied manifestations.
For since we do not all belong to one condition of life, but one is
a virgin, another a widow, a third lives a life of devotion—so
the robe of the Church signifies the constitution of the
Church.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xv.iv-p83">15. Inasmuch then as our Master knew that if
He carved out only one road for us, many must shrink from it, He
carved out divers roads. Thou canst not enter the kingdom it may be
by the way of virginity. Enter it then by the way of single
marriage. Canst thou not enter it by one marriage? Perchance thou
mayest by means of a second marriage. Thou canst not enter by the
way of continence: enter then by the way of almsgiving: or thou
canst not enter by the way of almsgiving? then try the way of
fasting. If thou canst not use this way, take that—or if not
that, then take this. Therefore the prophet spoke not of a garment
of gold, but of one woven with gold. It is of silk, or purple, or
gold. Thou canst not be a golden part? then be a silken one. I
accept thee, if only thou art clothed in my raiment. Therefore also
Paul saith “If any man builds upon this foundation, gold, silver,
precious stones.”<note place="end" n="877" id="xv.iv-p83.1"><p class="endnote" id="xv.iv-p84"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. iii. 12" id="xv.iv-p84.1" parsed="|1Cor|3|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.3.12">1 Cor.

married state, only abiding in the Church. Thou canst not be
without possessions? then give alms, only abiding in the Church,
only wearing the proper raiment, only submitting to the queen.<note place="end" n="879" id="xv.iv-p85.2"><p class="endnote" id="xv.iv-p86"> <i>i.e</i>., the Church.</p></note> The raiment
is woven with gold, it is manifold in texture. I do not bar the way
against thee: for the abundance of virtues has rendered the
dispensation of the king easy in operation. “Clothed in a vesture
woven with gold, manifold in texture.” Her vesture is manifold:
unfold, if you please, the deep meaning of the expression here
used, and fix your eyes upon this garment woven with gold. For here
indeed some live celibate, others live in an honourable estate of
matrimony being not much inferior to them: some have married once,
others are widows in the flower of their age. For what purpose is a
paradise? and wherefore its variety? having divers flowers, and
trees, and many pearls. There are many stars, but only one sun:
there are many ways of living, but only one paradise; there are
many temples, but only one mother of them all. There is the body,
the eye, the finger, but all these make up but one man. There is
the same distinction between the small, the great, and the less.
The virgin hath need of the married woman; for the virgin also is
the product of marriage, that marriage may not be despised by her.
The virgin is the root of marriage: thus all things have been
linked together, the small with the great, and the great with the
small. “The queen did stand on thy right hand clothed in a
vesture wrought with gold, manifold in texture.” Then follows
“Hearken! O daughter.” The conductor of the bride says that
thou art about to go forth from thy home to the home of the
bridegroom who in his essential nature far surpasses thee. I am the
conductor of the bride. “Hearken O daughter.” Did she
immediately become the wife? Yea: for here there is nothing
corporeal. For He espoused her as a wife, He loves her as a
daughter, He provides for her as a handmaid, He guards her as a
virgin, He fences her round like a garden, and cherishes her like a
member: as a head He provides for her, as a root he causes her to
grow, as a shepherd He feeds her, as a bridegroom He weds her, as a
propitiation He pardons her, as a sheep He is sacrificed, as a
bridegroom He preserves her in beauty, as a <pb n="263" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_263.html" id="xv.iv-Page_263" />husband He provides for her
support. Many are the meanings in order that we may enjoy a part if
it be but a small part of the divine economy of grace. “Hearken O
daughter” and behold, and look upon things which are bridal and
yet spiritual. Hearken O daughter. She was at first a daughter of
demons, a daughter of the earth, unworthy of the earth and now she
has become a daughter of the king. And this He wished who loved
her. For he who loves does not investigate character: love does not
regard uncomeliness: on this account indeed is it called love
because it oftentimes hath affection for an uncomely person.<note place="end" n="880" id="xv.iv-p86.1"><p class="endnote" id="xv.iv-p87"> The statement is grounded on a mistaken etymology.
There is also an allusion to the proverbial blindness of love.</p></note> Thus also
did Christ. He saw one who was uncomely (for comely I could not
call her) and He loved her, and He makes her young, not having spot
or wrinkle. Oh what a bridegroom! adorning with grace the
ungracefulness of his bride! Hearken O daughter! hearken and
behold! Two things He saith “Hearken” and “Behold,” two
which depend on thyself, one on thy eyes, the other on thy hearing.
Now since her dowry depended on hearing (and although some of you
have been acute enough to perceive this already, let them tarry for
those who are feebler: I commend those who have anticipated the
truth, and make allowances for those who only follow in their
track) since the dowry then depended on hearing—(and what is
meant by hearing? faith: for “faith cometh by hearing” faith as
opposed to fruition, and actual experience) I said before that He
divided the dowry into two, and gave some portion to the bride for
an earnest, whilst He promised others in the future. What did He
give her? He gave her forgiveness of sins, remission of punishment,
righteousness, sanctification, redemption, the body of the Lord,
the divine, spiritual Table, the resurrection of the dead. For all
these things the Apostles had. Therefore He gave some parts and
promised others. Of some there was experience and fruition, others
depended upon hope and faith. Now listen. What did He bestow?
Baptism and the Sacrifice. Of these there is experience. What did
He promise? Resurrection, immortality of the body, union with
angels, a place in the joyful company of archangels, and as a
citizen in His kingdom, immaculate life, the good things “which
eye hath not seen, nor ear heard nor have entered into the heart of
man, things which God hath prepared for them that love
Him.”</p>

<p class="c10" id="xv.iv-p88">16. Understand what is said, lest ye lose it:
I am labouring to enable you to perceive it. The dowry of the bride
then was divided into two portions consisting of things present and
things to come; things seen and things heard, things given and
things taken on trust, things experienced, and things to be enjoyed
hereafter; things belonging to present life, and things to come
after the resurrection. The former things you see, the latter you
hear. Observe then what He says to her that you may not suppose
that she received the former things only, though they be great and
ineffable, and surpassing all understanding. “Hearken O daughter
and behold;” hear the latter things and behold the former that
thou mayest not say “am I again to depend on hope, again on
faith, again on the future?” See now: I give some things, and I
promise others: the latter indeed depend on hope, but do thou
receive the others as pledges, as an earnest, as a proof of the
remainder. I promise thee a kingdom: and let present things be the
ground of thy trust, thy trust in me. Dost thou promise me a
kingdom? Yea. I have given thee the greater part, even the Lord of
the kingdom, for “he who spared not his own son, but gave him up
for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all
things?”<note place="end" n="881" id="xv.iv-p88.1"><p class="endnote" id="xv.iv-p89"> <scripRef passage="Rom. viii. 32" id="xv.iv-p89.1" parsed="|Rom|8|32|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.8.32">Rom. viii.

give me the resurrection of the body? Yea; I have given thee the
greater part. What is the nature of it? Release from sins. How is
that the greater part? Because sin brought forth death. I have
destroyed the parent, and shall I not destroy the offspring? I have
dried up the root, and shall I not destroy the produce. “Hearken
O daughter and behold.” What am I to behold? Dead men raised to
life, lepers cleansed, the sea restrained, the paralytic braced up
into vigour, paradise opened, loaves poured forth in abundance,
sins remitted, the lame man leaping, the robber made a citizen of
paradise, the publican turned into an evangelist, the harlot become
more modest than the maid. Hear and behold. Hear of the former
things and behold these. Accept from present things a proof of the
others; concerning those I have given thee pledges, things which
are better than they are. “What is the meaning of this thy
saying?” These things are mine. “Hearken O daughter and
behold.” These things are my dower to thee. And what doth the
bride contribute? Let us see. What I pray thee dost thou bring that
thou mayest not be portionless? What can I, she answers, bring to
thee from heathen altars, and the steam of sacrifices and from
devils? What have I to contribute? what? sayest thou? Thy will and
thy faith. “Hearken O daughter and behold.” And what wilt thou
have me do? “Forget thy own 
<pb n="264" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_264.html" id="xv.iv-Page_264" />people.” What kind of people? the devils, the
idols, the sacrificial smoke, and steam, and blood. “Forget thy
own people, and thy father’s house.” Leave thy father and come
after me. I left my Father, and came to thee, and wilt thou not
leave thy father? But when the word leave is used in reference to
the Son do not understand by it an actual leaving. What He means is
“I condescended, I accommodated myself to thee, I assumed human
flesh.” This is the duty of the bridegroom, and of the bride,
that thou shouldest abandon thy parents, and that we should be
wedded to one another. “Hearken O daughter and behold, and forget
thy own people, and thy father’s house.” And what dost thou
give me if I do forget them? “and the king shall desire thy
beauty.” Thou hast the Lord for thy lover. If thou hast Him for
thy lover, thou hast also the things which are his. I trust ye may
be able to understand what is said: for the thought is a subtle
one, and I wish to stop the mouth of the Jews.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xv.iv-p90">Now exert your minds I pray: for whether one hears,
or forbears to hear I shall dig and till the soil. “Hearken O
daughter, and behold, forget also thy own people, and thy
father’s house, and the king shall desire thy beauty.” By
beauty in this passage the Jew understands sensible beauty; not
spiritual but corporeal.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xv.iv-p91">17. Attend, and let us learn what corporeal,
and what spiritual beauty are. There is soul and body: they are two
substances: there is a beauty of body, and there is a beauty of
soul. What is beauty of body? an extended eyebrow, a merry glance,
a blushing cheek, ruddy lips, a straight neck, long wavy hair,
tapering fingers, upright stature, a fair blooming complexion. Does
this bodily beauty come from nature, or from choice? Confessedly it
comes from nature. Attend that thou mayest learn the conception of
philosophers. This beauty whether of the countenance, of the eye,
of the hair, of the brow, does it come from nature, or from choice?
It is obvious that it comes from nature. For the ungraceful woman,
even if she cultivate beauty in countless ways, cannot become
graceful in body: for natural conditions are fixed, and confined by
limits which they cannot pass over. Therefore the beautiful woman
is always beautiful, even if she has no taste for beauty: and the
ungraceful cannot make herself graceful, nor the graceful
ungraceful. Wherefore? because these things come from nature. Well!
thou hast seen corporeal beauty. Now let us turn inwards to the
soul: let the handmaid approach the mistress! let us turn I say to
the soul. Look upon that beauty, or rather listen to it: for thou
canst not see it since it is invisible—Listen to that beauty.
What then is beauty of soul? Temperance, mildness, almsgiving,
love, brotherly kindness, tender affection, obedience to God, the
fulfilment of the law, righteousness, contrition of heart. These
things are the beauty of the soul. These things then are not the
results of nature, but of moral disposition. And he who does not
possess these things is able to receive them, and he who has them,
if he becomes careless, loses them. For as in the case of the body
I was saying that she who is ungraceful cannot become graceful; so
in the case of the soul I say the contrary that the graceless soul
can become full of grace. For what was more graceless than the soul
of Paul when he was a blasphemer and insulter: what more full of
grace when he said “I have fought the good fight, I have finished
the course, I have kept the faith.”<note place="end" n="882" id="xv.iv-p91.1"><p class="endnote" id="xv.iv-p92"> <scripRef passage="2 Tim. iv. 7" id="xv.iv-p92.1" parsed="|2Tim|4|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Tim.4.7">2 Tim. iv.
7</scripRef>.</p></note> What was more graceless than the
soul of the robber? what more full of grace when he heard the words

paradise?”<note place="end" n="883" id="xv.iv-p92.2"><p class="endnote" id="xv.iv-p93"> <scripRef passage="Luke xxiii. 43" id="xv.iv-p93.1" parsed="|Luke|23|43|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.23.43">Luke

more graceless than the publican when he practised extortion? but
what more full of grace when he declared his resolution.<note place="end" n="884" id="xv.iv-p93.2"><p class="endnote" id="xv.iv-p94"> <scripRef passage="Luke xix. 8" id="xv.iv-p94.1" parsed="|Luke|19|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.19.8">Luke xix.
8</scripRef>.</p></note> Seest thou
that thou canst not alter grace of body, for it is the result not
of moral disposition, but of nature. But grace of soul is supplied
out of our own moral choice. Thou hast now received the definition.
Of what kind are they? that the beauty of the soul proceeds from
obedience to God. For if the graceless soul obeys God it puts off
its ungracefulness, and becomes full of grace. “Saul! Saul!” it
was said, “why persecutest thou me?” and he replied “and who
art Thou Lord?” “I am Jesus.”<note place="end" n="885" id="xv.iv-p94.2"><p class="endnote" id="xv.iv-p95"> <scripRef passage="Acts ix. 4, 5" id="xv.iv-p95.1" parsed="|Acts|9|4|9|5" osisRef="Bible:Acts.9.4-Acts.9.5">Acts ix.
4, 5</scripRef>.</p></note> And he obeyed, and his obedience
made the graceless soul full of grace. Again, He saith to the
publican “come follow me”<note place="end" n="886" id="xv.iv-p95.2"><p class="endnote" id="xv.iv-p96"> <scripRef passage="Matt. ix. 9" id="xv.iv-p96.1" parsed="|Matt|9|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.9.9">Matt. ix.
9</scripRef>.</p></note> and the publican rose up and became
an apostle: and the graceless soul became full of grace. Whence? by
obedience. Again He saith to the fishermen “Come ye after me and
I will make you to become fishers of men:”<note place="end" n="887" id="xv.iv-p96.2"><p class="endnote" id="xv.iv-p97"> <scripRef passage="Matt. iv. 19" id="xv.iv-p97.1" parsed="|Matt|4|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.4.19">Matt. iv.
19</scripRef>.</p></note> and by their obedience their minds
became full of grace. Let us see then what kind of beauty He is
speaking of here. “Hearken O daughter and behold, and forget thy
own people and thy father’s house, and the king shall desire thy
beauty.” What kind of beauty will he desire? the spiritual kind.
How so? because she is to “<i>forget</i>” He saith “hearken
and forget.” These are acts of moral choice. “Hearken!” he
said: an ungraceful one hears and her ungracefulness being that of
the <pb n="265" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_265.html" id="xv.iv-Page_265" />body is not removed.
To the sinful woman He has said “Hearken,” and if she will obey
she sees what manner of beauty is bestowed upon her. Since then the
ungracefulness of the bride was not physical, but moral (for she
did not obey God but transgressed) therefore he leads her to
another remedy. Thou didst become ungraceful then, not by nature,
but by moral choice: and thou didst become full of grace by
obedience. “Hearken O daughter and behold and forget thy own
people, and thy father’s house, and the king shall desire thy
beauty.” Then that thou mayest learn that he does not mean
anything visible to sense, when thou hearest the word beauty, think
not of eye, or nose, or mouth, or neck, but of piety, faith, love,
things which are within—“for all the glory of the king’s
daughter is from within.” Now for all these things let us offer
thanks to God, the giver, for to Him alone belongeth glory, honour,
might, for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

MAN WHO DOES NOT INJURE HIMSELF.</span></p>

<p class="c9" id="xvi.ii-p2"><span class="c12" id="xvi.ii-p2.1">This</span> very beautiful treatise
was composed when St. Chrysostom was in exile, probably not long
before his death, and was sent with a letter to his great friend
the deaconess Olympias in Constantinople.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvi.ii-p3">Plato in the 10th book of his Dialogue called the
“Republic” employs an argument to prove the immortality of the
soul, so nearly resembling a portion of this treatise that I can
scarcely doubt St. Chrysostom had it in his mind. The following is
the passage in the Platonic dialogue as rendered in the excellent
translation of Messrs. Davies &amp; Vaughan. I omit a few sentences
here and there.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvi.ii-p4">“Have you not learned, I asked, that our soul is
immortal and never dies?</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvi.ii-p5">He looked at me and said in amazement. No really I
have not: but can you maintain this doctrine?</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvi.ii-p6">Yes as I am an honest man, I replied, and I think
you could also. It is quite easy to do it.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvi.ii-p7">Proceed by all means.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvi.ii-p8">So you call one thing good and another evil?</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvi.ii-p9">I do.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvi.ii-p10">And do we hold the same opinion as to the meaning of
two terms?</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvi.ii-p11">What opinion do you hold?</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvi.ii-p12">I hold that the term evil comprises everything that
destroys and corrupts, and the term good everything that preserves
and benefits.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvi.ii-p13">So do I.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvi.ii-p14">Again; do you maintain that everything has its evil
and its good? Do you say for example that the eyes are liable to
the evil of ophthalmia, the entire body to disease, corn to mildew,
timber to rot, copper and iron to rust or in other words that
almost everything is liable to some connatural evil and malady?</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvi.ii-p15">I do.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvi.ii-p16">And is it not the case that, whenever an object is
attacked by one of these maladies it is impaired; and in the end
completely broken up and destroyed by it?</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvi.ii-p17">Doubtless it is so?</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvi.ii-p18">Hence everything is destroyed by its own connatural
evil and vice: otherwise if it be not destroyed by this, there is
nothing else that can corrupt it. For that which is good will never
destroy anything, nor yet that which is neither good nor evil.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvi.ii-p19">Of course not.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvi.ii-p20">If then we can find among existing things one which
is liable to a particular evil which can indeed mar it, but cannot
break it up or destroy it, shall we not be at once certain that a
thing so constituted can never perish?</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvi.ii-p21">That would be a reasonable conclusion.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvi.ii-p22"><pb n="270" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_270.html" id="xvi.ii-Page_270" />Well then is not
the soul liable to a malady which renders it evil?</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvi.ii-p23">Certainly it is: all those things which we were
lately discussing—injustice, intemperance, cowardice, and
ignorance—produce that result.”</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvi.ii-p24">Then having proved that although these things injure
the soul they do not actually destroy it he proceeds.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvi.ii-p25">“Well, it is irrational to suppose that a thing
can be destroyed by the depravity of another thing, though it
cannot be destroyed by its own.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvi.ii-p26">True it is irrational.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvi.ii-p27">Yes it is: for you must remember that we do not
imagine that a body is to be destroyed by the proper depravity of
its food whatever that may be, whether mouldiness or rottenness or
anything else. But if the depravity of the food itself produces in
the body a disorder proper to the body, we shall assert that the
body has been destroyed by its food remotely, but by its own proper
vice or disease, immediately: and we shall always disclaim the
notion that the body can be corrupted by the depravity of its food
which is a different thing from the body—that is to say, the
notion that the body can be corrupted by an alien evil without the
introduction of its own native evil.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvi.ii-p28">You are perfectly correct.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvi.ii-p29">Then according to the same reasoning I continued,
unless depravity of body introduces into the soul depravity of soul
let us never suppose that the soul can be destroyed by an alien
evil without the presence of its own peculiar disease: for that
would be to suppose that one thing can be destroyed by the evil of
another thing.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvi.ii-p30">That is a reasonable statement.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvi.ii-p31">Well then let us either refute this doctrine and
point out our mistake or else, so long as it remains unrefuted, let
us never assert that a fever or any other disease, or fatal
violence, or even the act of cutting up the entire body into the
smallest possible pieces can have any tendency to destroy the soul,
until it has been demonstrated that in consequence of this
treatment of the body the soul itself becomes more unjust and more
unholy. For so long as a thing is exempt from its own proper evil,
while an evil foreign to it appears in another subject, let us not
allow it to be said that this thing whether it be a soul or
anything else is in danger of being destroyed.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvi.ii-p32">Well, certainly no one will prove that the
souls of the dying become more unjust in consequence of death.”
Here follows a passage to prove that even injustice does not <i>
destroy</i> the soul, after which he proceeds,</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvi.ii-p33">“Surely then when the soul cannot be killed and
destroyed by its own depravity and its own evil, hardly will the
evil which is charged with the destruction of another thing destroy
a soul or anything else beyond its own appropriate object.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvi.ii-p34">Hardly: at least that is the natural inference.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvi.ii-p35">Hence, as it is destroyed by no evil at all, whether
foreign to it or its own, it is clear that the soul must be always
existing, and therefore immortal.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvi.ii-p36">It must.”</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvi.ii-p37">If any one will compare this extract with chapters 2
to 6 in the following treatise he cannot fail to be struck by the
similarity of thought and language, although in the latter case it
is more apparent in the original than it can be in translation. The
aim of the two writers is not indeed identical: Chrysostom’s
object is to prove that nothing can really injure a man except
sin—depravity of soul—Plato begins by proving this, and
proceeds to maintain that if even that which corrupts the soul
cannot actually destroy it the soul must be imperishable. They
employ the same argument, only Plato carries it a step further than
Chrysostom.</p>

<div2 title="A Treatise to Prove that No One Can Harm the Man Who Does Not Injure Himself." shorttitle="" progress="48.38%" prev="xvi.ii" next="xvii" id="xvi.iii"><p class="c29" id="xvi.iii-p1">

<pb n="271" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_271.html" id="xvi.iii-Page_271" /><span class="c20" id="xvi.iii-p1.1">A
TREATISE</span></p>

<p class="c32" id="xvi.iii-p2"><span class="c30" id="xvi.iii-p2.1">TO PROVE THAT NO ONE CAN HARM THE
MAN WHO DOES NOT INJURE HIMSELF.</span></p>

<p class="c33" id="xvi.iii-p3">————————————</p>

<p class="c9" id="xvi.iii-p4">1. <span class="c12" id="xvi.iii-p4.1">I know</span> well that to
coarse-minded persons, who are greedy in the pursuit of present
things, and are nailed to earth, and enslaved to physical pleasure,
and have no strong hold upon spiritual ideas, this treatise will be
of a strange and paradoxical kind: and they will laugh
immoderately, and condemn me for uttering incredible things from
the very outset of my theme. Nevertheless, I shall not on this
account desist from my promise, but for this very reason shall
proceed with great earnestness to the proof of what I have
undertaken. For if those who take that view of my subject will
please not to make a clamour and disturbance, but wait to the end
of my discourse, I am sure that they will take my side, and condemn
themselves, finding that they have been deceived hitherto, and will
make a recantation, and apology, and crave pardon for the mistaken
opinion which they held concerning these matters, and will express
great gratitude to me, as patients do to physicians, when they have
been relieved from the disorders which lay seige to their body. For
do not tell me of the judgment which is prevailing in your mind at
the present time, but wait to hear the contention of my arguments
and then you will be able to record an impartial verdict without
being hindered by ignorance from forming a true judgment. For even
judges in secular causes, if they see the first orator pouring
forth a mighty torrent of words and overwhelming everything with
his speech do not venture to record their decision without having
patiently listened to the other speaker who is opposed to him; and
even if the remarks of the first speaker seem to be just to an
unlimited extent, they reserve an unprejudiced hearing for the
second. In fact the special merit of judges consists in
ascertaining with all possible accuracy what each side has to
allege and then bringing forward their own judgment.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvi.iii-p5">Now in the place of an orator we have the common
assumption of mankind which in the course of ages has taken deep
root in the minds of the multitude, and declaims to the following
effect throughout the world. “All things” it says “have been
turned upside down, the human race is full of much confusion and
many are they who every day are being wronged, insulted, subjected
to violence and injury, the weak by the strong, the poor by the
rich: and as it is impossible to number the waves of the sea, so is
it impossible to reckon the multitude of those who are the victims
of intrigue, insult, and suffering; and neither the correction of
law, nor the fear of being brought to trial, nor anything else can
arrest this pestilence and disorder, but the evil is increasing
every day, and the groans, and lamentations, and weeping of the
sufferers are universal; and the judges who are appointed to reform
such evils, themselves intensify the tempest, and inflame the
disorder, and hence many of the more senseless and despicable kind,
seized with a new kind of frenzy, accuse the providence of God,
when they see the forbearing man often violently seized, racked,
and oppressed, and the audacious, impetuous, low and low-born man
waxing rich, and invested with authority, and becoming formidable
to many, and inflicting countless troubles upon the more moderate,
and this perpetrated both in town and country, 
<pb n="272" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_272.html" id="xvi.iii-Page_272" />and desert, on sea and land. This discourse of
ours of necessity comes in by way of direct opposition to what has
been alleged, maintaining a contention which is new, as I said at
the beginning, and contrary to opinion, yet useful and true, and
profitable to those who will give heed to it and be persuaded by
it; for what I undertake is to prove (only make no commotion) that
no one of those who are wronged is wronged by another, but
experiences this injury at his own hands.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvi.iii-p6">2. But in order to make my argument plainer, let us
first of all enquire what injustice is, and of what kind of things
the material of it is wont to be composed; also what human virtue
is, and what it is which ruins it; and further what it is which
seems to ruin it but really does not. For instance (for I must
complete my argument by means of examples) each thing is subject to
one evil which ruins it; iron to rust, wool to moth, flocks of
sheep to wolves. The virtue of wine is injured when it ferments and
turns sour: of honey when it loses its natural sweetness, and is
reduced to a bitter juice. Ears of corn are ruined by mildew and
drought, and the fruit, and leaves, and branches of vines by the
mischievous host of locusts, other trees by the caterpillar, and
irrational creatures by diseases of various kinds: and not to
lengthen the list by going through all possible examples, our own
flesh is subject to fevers, and palsies, and a crowd of other
maladies. As then each one of these things is liable to that which
ruins its virtue, let us now consider what it is which injures the
human race, and what it is which ruins the virtue of a human being.
Most men think that there are divers things which have this effect;
for I must mention the erroneous opinions on the subject, and,
after confuting them, proceed to exhibit that which really does
ruin our virtue: and to demonstrate clearly that no one could
inflict this injury or bring this ruin upon us unless we betrayed
ourselves. The multitude then having erroneous opinions imagine
that there are many different things which ruin our virtue: some
say it is poverty, others bodily disease, others loss of property,
others calumny, others death and they are perpetually bewailing and
lamenting these things: and whilst they are commiserating the
sufferers and shedding tears they excitedly exclaim to one another
“What a calamity has befallen such and such a man! he has been
deprived of all his fortune at a blow.” Of another again one will
say: “such and such a man has been attacked by severe sickness
and is despaired of by the physicians in attendance.” Some bewail
and lament the inmates of the prison, some those who have been
expelled from their country and transported to the land of exile,
others those who have been deprived of their freedom, others those
who have been seized and made captives by enemies, others those who
have been drowned, or burnt, or buried by the fall of a house, but
no one mourns those who are living in wickedness: on the contrary,
which is worse than all, they often congratulate them, a practice
which is the cause of all manner of evils. Come then (only, as I
exhorted you at the outset, do not make a commotion), let me prove
that none of the things which have been mentioned injure the man
who lives soberly, nor can ruin his virtue. For tell me if a man
has lost his all either at the hands of calumniators or of robbers,
or has been stripped of his goods by knavish servants, what harm
has the loss done to the virtue of the man?</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvi.iii-p7">But if it seems well let me rather indicate in the
first place what is the virtue of a man, beginning by dealing with
the subject in the case of existences of another kind so as to make
it more intelligible and plain to the majority of readers.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvi.iii-p8">3. What then is the virtue of a horse? is it to have
a bridle studded with gold and girths to match, and a band of
silken threads to fasten the housing, and clothes wrought in divers
colours and gold tissue, and head gear studded with jewels, and
locks of hair plaited with gold cord? or is it to be swift and
strong in its legs, and even in its paces, and to have hoofs
suitable to a well bred horse, and courage fitted for long journies
and warfare, and to be able to behave with calmness in the battle
field, and if a rout takes place to save its rider? Is it not
manifest that these are the things which constitute the virtue of
the horse, not the others? Again, what should you say was the
virtue of asses and mules? is it not the power of carrying burdens
with contentment, and accomplishing journies with ease, and having
hoofs like rock? Shall we say that their outside trappings
contribute anything to their own proper virtue? By no means. And
what kind of vine shall we admire? one which abounds in leaves and
branches, or one which is laden with fruit? or what kind of virtue
do we predicate of an olive? is it to have large boughs, and great
luxuriance of leaves, or to exhibit an abundance of its proper
fruit dispersed over all parts of the tree? Well, let us act in the
same way in the case of human beings also: let us determine what is
the virtue of man, and let us regard that alone as an injury, which
is destructive to it. What then is the 
<pb n="273" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_273.html" id="xvi.iii-Page_273" />virtue of man? not riches that thou shouldest
fear poverty: nor health of body that thou shouldest dread
sickness, nor the opinion of the public, that thou shouldest view
an evil reputation with alarm, nor life simply for its own sake,
that death should be terrible to thee: nor liberty that thou
shouldest avoid servitude: but carefulness in holding true
doctrine, and rectitude in life. Of these things not even the devil
himself will be able to rob a man, if he who possesses them guards
them with the needful carefulness: and that most malicious and
ferocious demon is aware of this. For this cause also he robbed Job
of his substance, not to make him poor, but that he might force him
into uttering some blasphemous speech; and he tortured his body,
not to subject him to infirmity, but to upset the virtue of his
soul. But nevertheless when he had set all his devices in motion,
and turned him from a rich man into a poor one (that calamity which
seems to us the most terrible of all), and had made him childless
who was once surrounded by many children, and had scarified his
whole body more cruelly than the executioners do in the public
tribunals (for their nails do not lacerate the sides of those who
fall into their hands so severely as the gnawing of the worms
lacerated his body), and when he had fastened a bad reputation upon
him (for Job’s friends who were present with him said “thou
hast not received the chastisement which thy sins deserve,” and
directed many words of accusation against him), and after he had
not merely expelled him from city and home and transferred him to
another city, but had actually made the dunghill serve as his home
and city; after all this, he not only did him no damage but
rendered him more glorious by the designs which he formed against
him. And he not only failed to rob him of any of his possessions
although he had robbed him of so many things, but he even increased
the wealth of his virtue. For after these things he enjoyed greater
confidence inasmuch as he had contended in a more severe contest.
Now if he who underwent such sufferings, and this not at the hand
of man, but at the hand of the devil who is more wicked than all
men, sustained no injury, which of those persons who say such and
such a man injured and damaged me will have any defence to make in
future? For if the devil who is full of such great malice, after
having set all his instruments in motion, and discharged all his
weapons, and poured out all the evils incident to man, in a
superlative degree upon the family and the person of that righteous
man nevertheless did him no injury, but as I was saying rather
profited him: how shall certain be able to accuse such and such a
man alleging that they have suffered injury at their hands, not at
their own?</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvi.iii-p9">4. What then? some one will say, did he not inflict
injury on Adam, and upset him, and cast him out of paradise? No: he
did it not, but the cause was the listlessness of him who was
injured, and his want of temperance and vigilance. For he who
applied such powerful and manifold devices and yet was not able to
subdue Job, how could he by inferior means have mastered Adam, had
not Adam betrayed himself through his own listlessness? What then?
Has not he been injured who has been exposed to slander, and
suffered confiscation of his property, having been deprived of all
his goods, and is thrown out of his patrimony, and struggles with
extreme poverty? No! he has not been injured, but has even
profited, if he be sober. For, tell me, what harm did this do the
apostles? Were they not continually struggling with hunger, and
thirst and nakedness? And this was the very reason why they were so
illustrious, and distinguished, and won for themselves much help
from God. Again what harm was done to Lazarus by his disease, and
sores, and poverty and dearth of protectors? Were they not the
reasons why garlands of victory were more abundantly woven for him?
Or what harm was done to Joseph by his getting evil reported of,
both in his own land, and in the land of strangers for he was
supposed to be both an adulterer and fornicator: or what harm did
servitude do him or expatriation? Is it not specially on account of
these things that we regard him with admiration and astonishment?
And why do I speak of removal into a foreign land, and poverty, and
evil report, and bondage? For what harm did death itself inflict on
Abel, although it was a violent and untimely death, and perpetrated
by a brother’s hand? Is not this the reason why his praise is
sounded throughout the whole world? Seest thou how the discourse
has demonstrated even more than it promised? For not only has it
disclosed the fact that no one is injured by anybody, but also that
they who take heed to themselves derive the greater gain (from such
assaults). What is the purpose then it will be said of penalties
and punishments? What is the purpose of hell? What is the purpose
of such great threatenings, if no one is either injured or injures?
What is it thou sayest? Why dost thou confuse the argument? For I
did not say that no one injures, but that no one is injured. And
how is it possible, you will say, for no one to be injured when
many <pb n="274" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_274.html" id="xvi.iii-Page_274" />are committing
injury? In the way which I indicated just now. For Joseph’s
brethren did indeed injure him, yet he himself was not injured: and
Cain laid snares for Abel, yet he himself was not ensnared. This is
the reason why there are penalties and punishments. For God does
not abolish penalties on account of the virtue of those who suffer;
but he ordains punishments on account of the malice of those who do
wickedly. For although they who are evil entreated become more
illustrious in consequence of the designs formed against them, this
is not due to the intention of those who plan the designs, but to
the courage of those who are the victims of them. Wherefore for the
latter the rewards of philosophy are made ready and prepared, for
the former the penalties of wickedness. Hast thou been deprived of
thy money? Read the word “Naked came I out of my mother’s womb,
and naked shall I return thither.”<note place="end" n="888" id="xvi.iii-p9.1"><p class="endnote" id="xvi.iii-p10"> <scripRef passage="Job i. 21" id="xvi.iii-p10.1" parsed="|Job|1|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Job.1.21">Job i.

advantage of them in the case of those who bear them
bravely.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvi.iii-p15">5. When then neither loss of money, nor slander, nor
railing, nor banishment, nor diseases, nor tortures, nor that which
seems more formidable than all, namely death, harms those who
suffer them, but rather adds to their profit, whence can you prove
to me that any one is injured when he is not injured at all from
any of these things? For I will endeavour to prove the reverse,
showing that they who are most injured and insulted, and suffer the
most incurable evils are the persons who do these things. For what
could be more miserable than the condition of Cain, who dealt with
his brother in this fashion? what more pitiable than that of
Phillip’s wife who beheaded John? or the brethren of Joseph who
sold him away, and transported him into the land of exile? or the
devil who tortured Job with such great calamities? For not only on
account of his other iniquities, but at the same time also for this
assault he will pay no trifling penalty. Dost thou see how here the
argument has proved even more than was proposed, shewing that those
who are insulted not only sustain no harm from these assaults, but
that the whole mischief recoils on the head of those who contrive
them? For since neither wealth nor freedom, nor life in our native
land nor the other things which I have mentioned, but only right
actions of the soul, constitute the virtue of man, naturally when
the harm is directed against these things, human virtue itself is
no wise harmed. What then? supposing some one does harm the moral
condition of the soul? Even then if a man suffers damage, the
damage does not come from another but proceeds from within, and
from the man himself. “How so,” do you say? When any one having
been beaten by another, or deprived of his goods, or having endured
some other grievous insult, utters a blasphemous speech, he
certainly sustains a damage thereby, and a very great one,
nevertheless it does not proceed from him who has inflicted the
insult, but from his own littleness of soul. For what I said before
I will now repeat, no man if he be infinitely wicked could attack
any one more wickedly or more bitterly than that revengeful demon
who is implacably hostile to us, the devil: but yet this cruel
demon had not power to upset or overthrow him who lived before the
law, and before the time of grace, although he discharged so many
and such bitter weapons against him from all quarters. Such is the
force of nobility of soul. And what shall I say of Paul? Did he not
suffer so many distresses that even to make a list of them is no
easy matter? He was put in prison, loaded with chains, dragged
hither and hither, scourged by the Jews, stoned, lacerated on the
back not only by thongs, but also by rods, he was immersed in the
sea, oftentimes beset by robbers, involved in strife with his own
countrymen, continually assailed both by foes and by acquaintance,
subjected to countless intrigues, struggling with hunger and <pb n="275" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_275.html" id="xvi.iii-Page_275" />nakedness, undergoing other
frequent and lasting mischances and afflictions: and why need I
mention the greater part of them? he was dying every day: but yet,
although subjected to so many and such grievous sufferings, he not
only uttered no blasphemous word, but rejoiced over these things
and gloried in them: and one time he says “I rejoice in my
sufferings,”<note place="end" n="893" id="xvi.iii-p15.1"><p class="endnote" id="xvi.iii-p16"> <scripRef passage="Col. i. 24" id="xvi.iii-p16.1" parsed="|Col|1|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Col.1.24">Col. i.

rejoiced and gloried when suffering such great troubles what excuse

<p class="c10" id="xvi.iii-p18">6. But I am injured in other ways, one will
say, and even if I do not blaspheme, yet when I am robbed of my
money I am disabled from giving alms. This is a mere pretext and
pretence. For if you grieve on this account know certainly that
poverty is no bar to almsgiving. For even if you are infinitely
poor you are not poorer than the woman who possessed only a handful

substance upon those who were in need was an object of surpassing
admiration: and such great poverty was no hindrance to such great
lovingkindness, but the alms bestowed from the two mites was so
abundant and generous as to eclipse all who had riches, and in
wealth of intention and superabundance of zeal to surpass those who
cast in much coin. Wherefore even in this matter thou art not
injured but rather benefitted, receiving by means of a small
contribution rewards more glorious than they who put down large
sums. But since, if I were to say these things for ever, sensuous
characters which delight to grovel in worldly things, and revel in
present things would not readily endure parting from the fading
flowers (for such are the pleasant things of this life) or letting
go its shadows: but the better sort of men indeed cling to both the
one and the other, while the more pitiable and abject cling more
strongly to the former than to the latter, come let us<note place="end" n="897" id="xvi.iii-p20.2"><p class="endnote" id="xvi.iii-p21"> The passage is obscure, but St. Chrysostom seems to
divide the pleasures of this world into two classes: the more

the pleasant and showy masks which hide the base and ugly
countenance of these things, and let us expose the foul deformity
of the harlot. For such is the character of a life of this kind
which is devoted to luxury, and wealth and power: it is foul and
ugly and full of much abomination, disagreeable and burdensome, and
charged with bitterness. For this indeed is the special feature in
this life which deprives those who are captivated by it of every
excuse, that although it is the aim of their longings and
endeavours, yet is it filled with much annoyance and bitterness,
and teems with innumerable evils, dangers, bloodshed, precipices,
crags, murders, fears and tremblings, envy and ill-will, and
intrigue, perpetual anxiety and care, and derives no profit, and
produces no fruit from these great evils save punishment and
revenge, and incessant torment. But although this is its character
it seems to be to most men an object of ambition, and eager
contention, which is a sign of the folly of those who are
captivated by it, not of the blessedness of the thing itself.
Little children indeed are eager and excited about toys and cannot
take notice of the things which become full grown men. There is an
excuse for them on account of their immaturity: but these others
are debarred from the right of defence, because, although of full
age they are childish in disposition, and more foolish than
children in their manner of life.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvi.iii-p22">Now tell me why is wealth an object of ambition? For
it is necessary to start from this point, because to the majority
of those who are afflicted with this grievous malady it seems to be
more precious than health and life, and public reputation, and good
opinion, and country, and household, and friends, and kindred and
everything else. Moreover the flame has ascended to the very
clouds: and this fierce heat has taken possession of land and sea.
Nor is there any one to quench this fire: but all people are
engaged in stirring it up, both those who have been already caught
by it, and those who have not yet been caught, in order that they
may be captured. And you may see every one, husband and wife,
household slave, and freeman, rich and poor, each according to his
ability carrying loads which supply much fuel to this fire by day
and night: loads not of wood or faggots (for the fire is not of
that kind), but loads of souls and bodies, of unrighteousness and
iniquity. For such is the material of which a fire of this kind is
wont to be kindled. For those who have riches place no limit
anywhere to this monstrous passion, even if they compass the whole
world: and the poor press on to get in advance of them, and a kind
of incurable craze, and unrestrainable frenzy and irremediable
disease possesses the souls of all. And this affection has
conquered every other kind and thrust it away expelling it from the
soul: neither friends nor kindred are taken into account: and why
do I speak of friends and kindred? not even wife and children are
<pb n="276" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_276.html" id="xvi.iii-Page_276" />regarded, and what can be
dearer to man than these? but all things are dashed to the ground
and trampled underfoot, when this savage and inhuman mistress has
laid hold of the souls of all who are taken captive by her. For as
an inhuman mistress, and harsh tyrant, and savage barbarian, and
public and expensive prostitute she debases and exhausts and
punishes with innumerable dangers and torments those who have
chosen to be in bondage to her; and yet although she is terrible
and harsh, and fierce and cruel, and has the face of a barbarian,
or rather of a wild beast, fiercer than a wolf or a lion, she seems
to those who have been taken captive by her gentle and loveable,
and sweeter than honey. And although she forges swords and weapons
against them every day, and digs pitfalls and leads them to
precipices and crags and weaves endless snares of punishment for
them, yet is she supposed to make these things objects of ambition
to those who have been made captive, and those who are desiring to
be captured. And just as a sow delights and revels in wallowing in
the ditch and mire, and beetles delight in perpetually crawling
over dung; even so they who are captivated by the love of money are
more miserable than these creatures. For the abomination is greater
in this case, and the mire more offensive: for they who are
addicted to this passion imagine that much pleasure is derived from
it: which does not arise from the nature of the thing, but of the
understanding which is afflicted with such an irrational taste. And
this taste is worse in their case than in that of brutes: for as
with the mire and the dung the cause of pleasure is not in them,
but in the irrational nature of the creatures who plunge into it;
even so count it to be in the case of human beings.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvi.iii-p23">7. And how might we cure those who are thus
disposed? It would be possible if they would open their ears to us,
and unfold their heart, and receive our words. For it is impossible
to turn and divert the irrational animals from their unclean habit;
for they are destitute of reason: but this the gentlest of all
tribes, honoured by reason and speech, I mean human nature, might,
if it chose, readily and easily be released from the mire and the
stench, and the dung hill and its abomination. For wherefore, O
man, do riches seem to thee worthy such diligent pursuit? Is it on
account of the pleasure which no doubt is derived from the table?
or on account of the honour and the escort of those who pay court
to thee, because of thy wealth? is it because thou art able to
defend thyself against those who annoy thee, and to be an object of
fear to all? For yon cannot name any other reasons, save pleasure
and flattery, and fear, and the power of taking revenge; for wealth
is not generally wont to make any one wiser, or more
self-controlled, or more gentle, or more intelligent, or kind, or
benevolent, or superior to anger, or gluttony or pleasure: it does
not train any one to be moderate, or teach him how to be humble,
nor introduce and implant any other piece of virtue in the soul.
Neither could you say for which of these things it deserves to be
so diligently sought and desired. For not only is it ignorant how
to plant and cultivate any good thing, but even if it finds a store
of them it mars and stunts and blights them; and some of them it
even uproots, and introduces their opposites, unmeasured
licentiousness, unseasonable wrath, unrighteous anger, pride,
arrogance, foolishness. But let me not speak of these; for they who
have been seized by this malady will not endure to hear about
virtue and vice, being entirely abandoned to pleasure and therefore
enslaved to it. Come then let us forego for the time being the
consideration of these points, and let us bring forward the others
which remain, and see whether wealth has any pleasure, or any
honour: for in my eyes the case is quite the reverse. And first of
all, if you please, let us investigate the meals of rich and poor,
and ask the guests which they are who enjoy the purest and most
genuine pleasure; is it they who recline for a full day on couches,
and join breakfast and dinner together, and distend their stomach,
and blunt their senses, and sink the vessel by an overladen cargo
of food, and waterlog the ship, and drench it as in some shipwreck
of the body, and devise fetters, and manacles, and gags, and bind
their whole body with the band of drunkenness and surfeit more
grievous than an iron chain, and enjoy no sound pure sleep
undisturbed by frightful dreams, and are more miserable than madmen
and introduce a kind of self-imposed demon into the soul and
display themselves as a laughing stock to the gaze of their
servants, or rather to the kinder sort amongst them as a tragical
spectacle eliciting tears, and cannot recognize any of those who
are present, and are incapable of speaking or hearing but have to
be carried away from their couches to their bed;—or is it they
who are sober and vigilant, and limit their eating by their need,
and sail with a favourable breeze, and find hunger and thirst the
best relish in their food and drink? For nothing is so conducive to
enjoyment and health as to be hungry and thirsty when one attacks
the viands, and to identify satiety with the sim<pb n="277" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_277.html" id="xvi.iii-Page_277" />ple necessity of food, never
overstepping the limits of this, nor imposing a load upon the body
too great for its strength.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvi.iii-p24">8. But if you disbelieve my statement study
the physical condition, and the soul of each class. Are not the
bodies vigorous of those who live thus moderately (for do not tell
me of that which rarely happens, although some may be weak from
some other circumstance, but form your judgment from those
instances which are of constant occurrence), I say are they not
vigorous, and their senses clear, fulfilling their proper function
with much ease? whereas the bodies of the others are flaccid and
softer than wax, and beset with a crowd of maladies? For gout soon
fastens upon them, and untimely palsy, and premature old age, and
headache, and flatulence, and feebleness of digestion, and loss of
appetite, and they require constant attendance of physicians, and
perpetual doseing, and daily care. Are these things pleasurable?
tell me. Who of those that know what pleasure really is would say
so? For pleasure is produced when desire leads the way, and
fruition follows: now if there is fruition, but desire is nowhere
to be found, the conditions of pleasure fail and vanish. On this
account also invalids, although the most charming food is set
before them, partake of it with a feeling of disgust and sense of
oppression: because there is no desire which gives a keen relish to
the enjoyment of it. For it is not the nature of the food, or of
the drink, but the appetite of the eaters which is wont to produce
the desire, and is capable of causing pleasure. Therefore also a
certain wise man who had an accurate knowledge of all that
concerned pleasure, and understood how to moralize about these
things said “the full soul mocketh at honeycombs:”<note place="end" n="898" id="xvi.iii-p24.1"><p class="endnote" id="xvi.iii-p25"> <scripRef passage="Prov. xxvii. 7" id="xvi.iii-p25.1" parsed="|Prov|27|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Prov.27.7">Prov.
xxvii. 7</scripRef>. Septuagint.</p></note> showing that
the conditions of pleasure consist not in the nature of the meal,
but in the disposition of the eaters. Therefore also the prophet
recounting the wonders in Egypt and in the desert mentioned this in
connexion with the others “He satisfied them with honey out of
the rock.”<note place="end" n="899" id="xvi.iii-p25.2"><p class="endnote" id="xvi.iii-p26"> <scripRef passage="Ps. lxxxi. 16" id="xvi.iii-p26.1" parsed="|Ps|81|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.81.16">Ps. lxxxi.
16</scripRef>.</p></note> And yet
nowhere does it appear that honey actually sprang forth for them
out of the rock: what then is the meaning of the expression?
Because the people being exhausted by much toil and long
travelling, and distressed by great thirst rushed to the cool
spring, their craving for drink serving as a relish, the writer
wishing to describe the pleasures which they received from those
fountains called the water honey, not meaning that the element was
converted into honey, but that the pleasure received from the water
rivalled the sweetness of honey, inasmuch as those who partook of
it rushed to it in their eagerness to drink.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvi.iii-p27">Since then these things are so and no one can
deny it, however stupid he may be: is it not perfectly plain that
pure, undiluted, and lively pleasure is to be found at the tables
of the poor? whereas at the tables of the rich there is discomfort,
and disgust and defilement? as that wise man has said “even sweet
things seem to be a vexation.”<note place="end" n="900" id="xvi.iii-p27.1"><p class="endnote" id="xvi.iii-p28"> Referring to 
<scripRef passage="Prov. xxvii. 7" id="xvi.iii-p28.1" parsed="|Prov|27|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Prov.27.7">Prov. xxvii. 7</scripRef>.</p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="xvi.iii-p29">9. But riches some one will say procure honour for
those who possess them, and enable them to take vengeance on their
enemies with ease. And is this a reason, pray, why riches seem to
you desirable and worth contending for;—that they nourish the
most dangerous passion in our nature, leading on anger into action,
swelling the empty bubbles of ambition, and stimulating and urging
men to arrogance? Why these are just the very reasons why we ought
resolutely to turn our backs upon riches, because they introduce
certain fierce and dangerous wild beasts into our heart depriving
us of the real honour which we might receive from all, and
introducing to deluded men another which is the opposite of this,
only painted over with its colours, and persuading them to fancy
that it is the same, when by nature it is not so, but only seems to
be so to the eye. For as the beauty of courtesans, made up as it is
of dyes and pigments, is destitute of real beauty, yet makes a foul
and ugly face appear fair and beautiful to those who are deluded by
it when it is not so in reality: even so also riches force flattery
to look like honour. For I beg you not to consider the praises
which are openly bestowed through fear and fawning: for these are
only tints and pigments; but unfold the conscience of each of those
who flatter you in this fashion, and inside it you will see
countless accusers declaring against you, and loathing and
detesting you more than your bitterest adversaries and foes. And if
ever a change of circumstances should occur which would remove and
expose this mask which fear has manufactured, just as the sun when
it emits a hotter ray than usual discloses the real countenances of
those women whom I mentioned, then you will see clearly that all
through the former time you were held in the greatest contempt by
those who paid court to you, and you fancied you were enjoying
honour from those who thoroughly hated you, and in their heart
poured infinite abuse upon you, and longed to see <pb n="278" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_278.html" id="xvi.iii-Page_278" />you involved in extreme calamities.
For there is nothing like virtue to produce honour,—honour
neither forced nor feigned, nor hidden under a mask of deceit, but
real and genuine, and able to stand the test of hard times.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvi.iii-p30">10. But do you wish to take vengeance on those
who have annoyed you? This, as I was saying just now, is the very
reason why wealth ought specially to be avoided. For it prepares
thee to thrust the sword against thyself, and renders thee liable
to a heavier account in the future day of reckoning, and makes thy
punishment intolerable. For revenge is so great an evil that it
actually revokes the mercy of God, and cancels the forgiveness of
countless sins which has been already bestowed. For he who received
remission of the debt of ten thousand talents, and after having
obtained so great a boon by merely asking for it then made a demand
of one hundred pence from his fellow servant, a demand, that is,
for satisfaction for his transgression against himself, in his
severity towards his fellow servant recorded his own condemnation;
and for this reason and no other he was delivered to the
tormentors, and racked, and required to pay back the ten thousand
talents; and he was not allowed the benefit of any excuse or
defence, but suffered the most extreme penalty, having been
commanded to deposit the whole debt which the lovingkindness of God
had formerly remitted.<note place="end" n="901" id="xvi.iii-p30.1"><p class="endnote" id="xvi.iii-p31"> <scripRef passage="Matt. xviii. 23-35" id="xvi.iii-p31.1" parsed="|Matt|18|23|18|35" osisRef="Bible:Matt.18.23-Matt.18.35">Matt.
xviii. 23–35</scripRef>.</p></note> Is this then the reason, pray, why
wealth is so earnestly pursued by thee, because it so easily
conducts thee into sin of this kind? Nay verily, this is why you
ought to abhor it as a foe and an adversary teeming with countless
murders. But poverty, some one will say, disposes men to be
discontented and often also to utter profane words, and condescend
to mean actions. It is not poverty which does this, but littleness
of soul: for Lazarus also was poor, aye! very poor: and besides
poverty he suffered from infirmity, a bitterer trial than any form
of poverty, and one which makes poverty more severely felt; and in
addition to infirmity there was a total absence of protectors, and
difficulty in finding any to supply his wants, which increased the
bitterness of poverty and infirmity. For each of these things is
painful in itself, but when there are none to minister to the
sufferer’s wants, the suffering becomes greater, the flame more
painful, the distress more bitter, the tempest fiercer, the billows
stronger, the furnace hotter. And if one examines the case
thoroughly there was yet a fourth trial besides these—the
unconcern and luxury of the rich man who dwelt hard by. And if you
would find a fifth thing, serving as fuel to the flame, you will
see quite clearly that he was beset by it. For not only was that
rich man living luxuriously, but twice, and thrice, or rather
indeed several times in the day he saw the poor man: for he had
been laid at his gate, being a grievous spectacle of pitiable
distress, and the bare sight of him was sufficient to soften even a
heart of stone: and yet even this did not induce that unmerciful
man to assist this case of poverty: but he had his luxurious table
spread, and goblets wreathed with flowers, and pure wine
plentifully poured forth, and grand armies of cooks, and parasites,
and flatterers from early dawn, and troops of singers, cupbearers,
and jesters; and he spent all his time in devising every species of
dissipation, and drunkenness, and surfeiting, and in revelling in
dress and feasting and many other things. But although he saw that
poor man every day distressed by grievous hunger and the bitterest
infirmity, and the oppression of his many sores, and by
destitution, and the ills which result from these things, he never
even gave him a thought: yet the parasites and the flatterers were
pampered even beyond their need; but the poor man, and he so very
poor, and encompassed with so many miseries, was not even
vouchsafed the crumbs which fell from that table, although he
greatly desired them: and yet none of these things injured him, he
did not give vent to a bitter word, he did not utter a profane
speech; but like a piece of gold which shines all the more
brilliantly when it is purified by excessive heat, even so he,
although oppressed by these sufferings, was superior to all of
them, and to the agitation which in many cases is produced by them.
For if generally speaking poor men, when they see rich men, are
consumed with envy and racked by malicious ill-will, and deem life
not worth living, and this even when they are well supplied with
necessary food, and have persons to minister to their wants; what
would the condition of this poor man have been had he not been very
wise and noble hearted, seeing that he was poor beyond all other
poor men, and not only poor, but also infirm, and without any one
to protect or cheer him, and lay in the midst of the city as if in
a remote desert, and wasted away with bitter hunger, and saw all
good things being poured upon the rich man as out of a fountain,
and had not the benefit of any human consolation, but lay exposed
as a perpetual meal for the tongues of the dogs, for he was so
enfeebled and broken down in 
<pb n="279" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_279.html" id="xvi.iii-Page_279" />body that he could not scare them away? Dost thou
perceive that he who does not injure himself suffers no evil? for I
will again take up the same argument.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvi.iii-p32">11. For what harm was done to this hero by his
bodily infirmity? or by the absence of protectors? or by the coming
of the dogs? or the evil proximity of the rich man? or by the great
luxury, haughtiness and arrogance of the latter? Did it enervate
him for the contest on behalf of virtue? Did it ruin his fortitude?
Nowhere was he harmed at all, but that multitude of sufferings, and
the cruelty of the rich man, rather increased his strength, and
became the pledge for him of infinite crowns of victory, a means of
adding to his rewards, an augmentation of his recompense, and a
promise of an increased requital. For he was crowned not merely on
account of his poverty, or of his hunger or of his sores, or of the
dogs licking them: but because, having such a neighbour as the rich
man, and being seen by him every day, and perpetually overlooked he
endured this trial bravely and with much fortitude, a trial which
added no small flame but in fact a very strong one to the fire of
poverty, and infirmity and loneliness.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvi.iii-p33">And, tell me, what was the case of the blessed Paul?
for there is nothing to prevent my making mention of him again. Did
he not experience innumerable storms of trial? And in what respect
was he injured by them? Was he not crowned with victory all the
more in consequence,—because he suffered hunger, because he was
consumed with cold and nakedness, because he was often tortured
with the scourge, because he was stoned, because he was cast into
the sea? But then some one says he was Paul, and called by Christ.
Yet Judas also was one of the twelve, and he too was called of
Christ; but neither his being of the twelve nor his call profited
him, because he had not a mind disposed to virtue. But Paul
although struggling with hunger, and at a loss to procure necessary
food, and daily undergoing such great sufferings, pursued with
great zeal the road which leads to heaven: whereas Judas although
he had been called before him, and enjoyed the same advantages as
he did, and was initiated in the highest form of Christian life,
and partook of the holy table and that most awful of sacred feasts,
and received such grace as to be able to raise the dead, and
cleanse the lepers, and cast out devils, and often heard discourses
concerning poverty, and spent so long a time in the company of
Christ Himself, and was entrusted with the money of the poor, so
that his passion might be soothed thereby (for he was a thief) even
then did not become any better, although he had been favoured with
such great condescension. For since Christ knew that he was
covetous, and destined to perish on account of his love of money he
not only did not demand punishment of him for this at that time,
but with a view to softening down his passion he was entrusted with
the money of the poor, that having some means of appeasing his
greed he might be saved from falling into that appalling gulf of
sin, checking the greater evil beforehand by a lesser one.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvi.iii-p34">12. Thus in no case will any one be able to
injure a man who does not choose to injure himself: but if a man is
not willing to be temperate, and to aid himself from his own
resources no one will ever be able to profit him. Therefore also
that wonderful history of the Holy Scriptures, as in some lofty,
large, and broad picture, has portrayed the lives of the men of old
time, extending the narrative from Adam to the coming of Christ:
and it exhibits to you both those who are upset, and those who are
crowned with victory in the contest, in order that it may instruct
you by means of all examples that no one will be able to injure one
who is not injured by himself, even if all the world were to kindle
a fierce war against him. For it is not stress of circumstances,
nor variation of seasons, nor insults of men in power, nor
intrigues besetting thee like snow storms, nor a crowd of
calamities, nor a promiscuous collection of all the ills to which
mankind is subject, which can disturb even slightly the man who is
brave, and temperate, and watchful; just as on the contrary the
indolent and supine man who is his own betrayer cannot be made
better, even with the aid of innumerable ministrations. This at
least was made manifest to us by the parable of the two men, of
whom the one built his house upon the rock, the other upon the
sand:<note place="end" n="902" id="xvi.iii-p34.1"><p class="endnote" id="xvi.iii-p35"> <scripRef passage="Matt. vii. 24" id="xvi.iii-p35.1" parsed="|Matt|7|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.7.24">Matt. vii.
24</scripRef>, etc.</p></note> not that we
are to think of sand and rock, or of a building of stone, and a
roof, or of rivers, and rain, and wild winds, beating against the
buildings, but we are to extract virtue and vice as the meaning of
these things, and to perceive from them that no one injures a man
who does not injure himself. Therefore neither the rain although
driven furiously along, nor the streams dashing against it with
much vehemence, nor the wild winds beating against it with a mighty
rush, shook the one house in any degree: but it remained
undisturbed, unmoved: that thou mightest understand that no trial
can agitate the man who does not betray himself. But the house of
the other man <pb n="280" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_280.html" id="xvi.iii-Page_280" />was easily
swept away, not on account of the force of the trials (for in that
case the other would have experienced the same fate), but on
account of his own folly; for it did not fall because the wind blew
upon it, but because it was built upon the sand, that is to say
upon indolence and iniquity. For before that tempest beat upon it,
it was weak and ready to fall. For buildings of that kind, even if
no one puts any pressure on them, fall to pieces of themselves, the
foundation sinking and giving way in every direction. And just as
cobwebs part asunder, although no strain is put upon them, but
adamant remains unshaken even when it is struck: even so also they
who do not injure themselves become stronger, even if they receive
innumerable blows; but they who betray themselves, even if there is
no one to harass them, fall of themselves, and collapse and perish.
For even thus did Judas perish, not only having been unassailed by
any trial of this kind, but having actually enjoyed the benefit of
much assistance.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvi.iii-p36">13. Would you like me to illustrate this
argument in the case of whole nations? What great forethought was
bestowed upon the Jewish nation! was not the whole visible creation
arranged with a view to their service? was not a new and strange
method of life introduced amongst them? For they had not to send
down to a market, and so they had the benefit of things which are
sold for money without paying any price for them: neither did they
cleave furrows nor drag a plough, nor harrow the ground, nor cast
in seed, nor had they need of rain and wind, and annual seasons,
nor sunshine, nor phases of the moon, nor climate, nor anything of
that kind; they prepared no threshing floor, they threshed no
grain, they used no winnowing fan for separating the grain from the
chaff, they turned no mill-stone, they built no oven, they brought
neither wood nor fire into the house, they needed no baker’s art,
they handled no spade, they sharpened no sickle, they required no
other art, I mean of weaving or building or supplying shoes: but
the word of God was everything to them. And they had a table
prepared off hand, free of all toil and labour. For such was the
nature of the manna; it was new and fresh, nowhere costing them any
trouble, nor straining them by labour. And their clothes, and
shoes, and even their physical frame forgot their natural
infirmity: for the former did not wear out in the course of so long
a time nor did their feet swell although they made such long
marches. Of physicians, and medicine, and all other concern about
that kind of art, there was no mention at all amongst them; so
completely banished was infirmity of every kind: for it is said
“He brought them out with silver and gold; and there was not one
feeble person among their tribes.”<note place="end" n="903" id="xvi.iii-p36.1"><p class="endnote" id="xvi.iii-p37"> <scripRef passage="Ps. cv. 37" id="xvi.iii-p37.1" parsed="|Ps|5|37|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.5.37">Ps. cv.
37</scripRef>.</p></note> But like men who had quitted this
world, and were transplanted to another and a better one, even so
did they eat and drink, neither did the sun’s ray when it waxed
hot smite their heads; for the cloud parted them from the fiery
beam, hovering all round them, and serving like a portable shelter
for the whole body of the people. Neither at night did they need a
torch to disperse the darkness, but they had the pillar of fire, a
source of unspeakable light, supplying two wants, one by its
shining, the other by directing the course of their journey; for it
was not only luminous, but also conducted that countless host along
the wilderness with more certainty than any human guide. And they
journeyed not only upon land but also upon sea as if it had been
dry land; and they made an audacious experiment upon the laws of
nature by treading upon that angry sea, marching through it as if
it had been the hard and resisting surface of a rock; and indeed
when they placed their feet upon it the element became like solid
earth, and gently sloping plains and fields; but when it received
their enemies it wrought after the nature of sea; and to the
Israelites indeed it served as a chariot, but to their enemies it
became a grave; conveying the former across with ease, but drowning
the latter with great violence. And the disorderly flood of water
displayed the good order and subordination which marks reasonable
and highly intelligent men, fulfilling the part at one time of a
guardian, at another of an executioner, and exhibiting these
opposites together on one day. What shall one say of the rocks
which gave forth streams of water? what of the clouds of birds
which covered the whole face of the earth by the number of their
carcases? what of the wonders in Egypt? what of the marvels in the
wilderness? what of the triumphs and bloodless victories? for they
subdued those who opposed them like men keeping holiday rather than
making war. And they vanquished their own masters without the use
of arms; and overcame those who fought with them after they left
Egypt by means of singing and music; and what they did was a
festival rather than a campaign, a religious ceremony rather than a
battle. For all these wonders took place not merely for the purpose
of supplying their need, but also that the people might preserve
more accurately <pb n="281" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_281.html" id="xvi.iii-Page_281" />the
doctrine which Moses inculcated of the knowledge of God; and voices
proclaiming the presence of their Master were uttered on all sides
of them. For the sea loudly declared this, by becoming a road for
them to march upon, and then turning into sea again: and the waters
of the Nile uttered this voice when they were converted into the
nature of blood; and the frogs, and the great army of locusts, and
the caterpillar and blight declared the same thing to all the
people; and the wonders in the desert, the manna, the pillar of
fire, the cloud, the quails, and all the other incidents served
them as a book, and writing which could never be effaced, echoing
daily in their memory and resounding in their mind. Nevertheless
after such great and remarkable providence, after all those
unspeakable benefits, after such mighty miracles, after care
indescribable, after continual teaching, after instruction by means
of speech, and admonition by means of deeds, after glorious
victories, after extraordinary triumphs, after abundant supply of
food, after the plentiful production of water, after the ineffable
glory with which they were invested in the eyes of the human race,
being ungrateful and senseless they worshipped a calf, and paid
reverence to the head of a bull, even when the memorials of God’s
benefits in Egypt were fresh in their minds, and they were still in
actual enjoyment of many more.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvi.iii-p38">14. But the Ninevites, although a barbarous
and foreign people who had never participated in any of these
benefits, small or great, neither words, nor wonders, nor works,
when they saw a man who had been saved from shipwreck, who had
never associated with them before, but appeared then for the first
time, enter their city and say “yet three days and Nineveh shall
be overthrown,”<note place="end" n="904" id="xvi.iii-p38.1"><p class="endnote" id="xvi.iii-p39"> <scripRef passage="Jonah iii. 4" id="xvi.iii-p39.1" parsed="|Jonah|3|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Jonah.3.4">Jonah iii.
4</scripRef>.</p></note> were so
converted and reformed by the mere sound of these words, and
putting away their former wickedness, advanced in the direction of
virtue by the path of repentance, that they caused the sentence of
God to be revoked, and arrested the threatened disturbance of their
city, and averted the heaven-sent wrath, and were delivered from
every kind of evil. “For,” we read, “God saw that every man
turned from his evil way, and was converted to the Lord.”<note place="end" n="905" id="xvi.iii-p39.2"><p class="endnote" id="xvi.iii-p40"> <scripRef passage="Jonah iii. 10" id="xvi.iii-p40.1" parsed="|Jonah|3|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Jonah.3.10">Jonah iii.
10</scripRef>.</p></note> How turned?
I ask. Although their wickedness was great, their iniquity
unspeakable, their moral sores difficult to heal, which was plainly
shown by the prophet when he said “their wickedness ascended even
unto the heaven:”<note place="end" n="906" id="xvi.iii-p40.2"><p class="endnote" id="xvi.iii-p41"> <scripRef passage="Jonah i. 2" id="xvi.iii-p41.1" parsed="|Jonah|1|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Jonah.1.2">Jonah i.
2</scripRef>.</p></note> indicating by the distance of the
place the magnitude of their wickedness; nevertheless such great
iniquity which was piled up to such a height as to reach even to
the heaven, all this in the course of three days in a brief moment
of time through the effect of a few words which they heard from the
mouth of one man and he an unknown shipwrecked stranger they so
thoroughly abolished, removed out of sight, and put away, as to
have the happiness of hearing the declaration “God saw that every
one turned from his evil way, and He repented of the evil which God
said He would do them.” Seest thou that he who is temperate and
watchful not only suffers no injury at the hands of man, but even
turns back Heaven-sent wrath? whereas he who betrays himself and
harms himself by his own doing, even if he receives countess
benefits, reaps no great advantage. So, at least, the Jews were not
profited by those great miracles, nor on the other hand were the
Ninevites harmed by having no share in them; but inasmuch as they
were inwardly well-disposed, having laid hold of a slight
opportunity they became better, barbarians and foreigners though
they were, ignorant of all divine revelation, and dwelling at a
distance from Palestine.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvi.iii-p42">15. Again, I ask, was the virtue of the
“three children” corrupted by the troubles which beset them?
Whilst they were still young, mere youths, of immature age, did
they not undergo that grievous affliction of captivity? had they
not to make a long journey from home, and when they had arrived in
the foreign country were they not cut off from fatherland and home
and temple, and altar and sacrifices, and offerings, and drink
offerings, and even the singing of psalms? For not only were they
debarred from their home, but as a consequence from many forms of
worship also. Were they not given up into the hands of barbarians,
wolves rather than men? and, most painful calamity of all, when
they had been banished into so distant and barbarous a country, and
were suffering such a grievous captivity were they not without
teacher, without prophets, without ruler? “for,” it is written,
“there is no ruler, nor prophet, nor governor, nor place for
offering before Thee and finding mercy.”<note place="end" n="907" id="xvi.iii-p42.1"><p class="endnote" id="xvi.iii-p43"> <scripRef passage="Song of the Three Children 15" id="xvi.iii-p43.1">Song of the Three Children, v. 15</scripRef>.</p></note> Yea moreover they were cast into
the royal palace, as upon some cliff and crag, and a sea full of
rocks and reefs, being compelled to sail over that angry sea
without a pilot or signal man, or crew, or sails; and they were
cooped up in the royal court as in a prison. For inasmuch as they
knew spiritual wisdom, and were superior to worldly things, and
despised all <pb n="282" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_282.html" id="xvi.iii-Page_282" />human
pride and made the wings of their soul soar upwards, they counted
their sojourn there as an aggravation of their trouble. For had
they been outside the court, and dwelling in a private house they
would have enjoyed more independence: but having been cast into
that prison (for they deemed the splendour of the palace no better
than a prison, no safer than a place of rocks and crags) they were
straightway subjected to cruel embarrassment. For the king
commanded them to be partakers of his own table, a luxurious,
unclean and profane table, a thing which was forbidden them, and
seemed more terrible than death; and they were lonely men hemmed in
like lambs amongst so many wolves. And they were constrained to
choose between being consumed by famine or rather led off to
execution, and tasting of forbidden meats. What then did these
youths do, forlorn as they were, captives, strangers, slaves of
those who commanded these things. They did not consider that this
strait or the absolute power of him who possessed the state
sufficed to justify their compliance; but they employed every
device and expedient to enable them to avoid the sin, although they
were abandoned on every side. For they could not influence men by
money: how should they, being captives? nor by friendship and
social intercourse? how should they being strangers? nor could they
get the better of them by any exertion of power: how was it
possible being slaves? nor master them by force of numbers: how
could they being only three? Therefore they approached the eunuch
who possessed the necessary authority, and persuaded him by their
arguments. For when they saw him fearful and trembling, and in an
agony of alarm concerning his own safety, and the dread of death
which agitated his soul was intolerable: “for I fear” said he
“my lord the king, lest he should see your countenances sadder
than the children which are of your sort and so shall ye endanger
my head to the king,”<note place="end" n="908" id="xvi.iii-p43.2"><p class="endnote" id="xvi.iii-p44"> <scripRef passage="Dan. i. 10" id="xvi.iii-p44.1" parsed="|Dan|1|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Dan.1.10">Dan. i.
10</scripRef>.</p></note> having released him from this fear
they persuaded him to grant them the favour. And inasmuch as they
brought to the work all the strength which they had, God also
henceforth contributed his strength to it. For it was not God’s
doing only that they achieved those things for the sake of which
they were to receive a reward, but the beginning and starting point
was from their own purpose, and having manifested that to be noble
and brave, they won for themselves the help of God, and so
accomplished their aim.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvi.iii-p45">16. Dost thou then perceive that if a man does not
injure himself, no one else will be able to harm him? Behold at
least youthfulness, and captivity and destitution, and removal into
a foreign land, and loneliness, and dearth of protectors, and a
stern command, and great fear of death assailing the mind of the
eunuch, and poverty, and feebleness of numbers, and dwelling in the
midst of barbarians, and having enemies for masters, and surrender
into the hands of the king himself, and separation from all their
kindred, and removal from priests and prophets, and from all others
who cared for them, and the cessation of drink offerings and
sacrifices, and loss of the temple and psalmody, and yet none of
these things harmed them; but they had more renown then than when
they enjoyed these things in their native land. And after they had
accomplished this task first and had wreathed their brows with the
glorious garland of victory, and had kept the law even in a foreign
land, and trampled under foot the tyrant’s command, and overcome
fear of the avenger, and yet received no harm from any quarter, as
if they had been quietly living at home and enjoying the benefit of
all those things which I mentioned, after they had thus fearlessly
accomplished their work they were again summoned to other contests.
And again they were the same men; and they were subjected to a more
severe trial than the former one, and a furnace was kindled, and
they were confronted by the barbarian army in company with the
king: and the whole Persian force was set in motion and everything
was devised which tended to put deceit or constraint upon them:
divers kinds of music, and various forms of punishment, and
threats, and what they saw on every side of them was alarming, and
the words which they heard were more alarming than what they saw;
nevertheless inasmuch as they did not betray themselves, but made
the most of their own strength, they never sustained any kind of
damage: but even won for themselves more glorious crowns of victory
than before. For Nabuchadonosor bound them and cast them into the
furnace, yet he burnt them not, but rather benefited them, and
rendered them more illustrious. And although they were deprived of
temple (for I will repeat my former remarks) and altar, and
fatherland, and priests and prophets, although they were in a
foreign and barbarous country, in the very midst of the furnace,
surrounded by all that mighty host, the king himself who wrought
this looking on, they set up a glorious trophy, and won a notable
victory, having sung that admirable and extraordinary hymn which
from that day to this has been sung 
<pb n="283" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_283.html" id="xvi.iii-Page_283" />throughout the world and will continue to be sung
to future generations.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvi.iii-p46">Thus then when a man does not injure himself, he
cannot possibly be hurt by another: for I will not cease harping
constantly upon this saying. For if captivity, and bondage, and
loneliness and loss of country and all kindred and death, and
burning, and a great army and a savage tyrant could not do any
damage to the innate virtue of the three children captives,
bondmen, strangers though they were in a foreign land, but the
enemy’s assault became to them rather the occasion of greater
confidence: what shall be able to harm the temperate man? There is
nothing, even should he have the whole world in arms against him.
But, some one may say, in their case God stood beside them, and
plucked them out of the flame. Certainly He did; and if thou wilt
play thy part to the best of thy power, the help which God supplies
will assuredly follow.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvi.iii-p47">17. Nevertheless the reason why I admire those
youths, and pronounce them blessed, and enviable, is not because
they tramped on the flame, and vanquished the force of the fire:
but because they were bound, and cast into the furnace, and
delivered to the fire for the sake of true doctrine. For this it
was which constituted the completeness of their triumph, and the
wreath of victory was placed on their brows as soon as they were
cast into the furnace and before the issue of events it began to be
weaved for them from the moment that they uttered those words which
they spoke with much boldness and freedom of speech to the king
when they were brought into his presence. “We have no need to
answer thee concerning this thing: for our God in Heaven whom we
serve is able to rescue us out of the burning fiery furnace: and He
will deliver us out of thy hands, O King. But if not, be it known
unto thee, O King, that we will not serve thy Gods nor worship the
golden image which thou hast set up.”<note place="end" n="909" id="xvi.iii-p47.1"><p class="endnote" id="xvi.iii-p48"> <scripRef passage="Dan. iii. 16-18" id="xvi.iii-p48.1" parsed="|Dan|3|16|3|18" osisRef="Bible:Dan.3.16-Dan.3.18">Dan. iii.
16–18</scripRef>.</p></note> After the utterance of these words
I proclaimed them conquerors; after these words having grasped the
prize of victory, they hastened on to the glorious crown of
martyrdom, following up the confession which they made through
their words with the confession made through their deeds. But if
when they had been cast into it, the fire had respect for their
bodies, and undid their bonds, and suffered them to go down into it
without fear, and forgot its natural force, so that the furnace of
fire became as a fountain of cool water, this marvel was the effect
of God’s grace and of the divine wonder-working power. Yet the
heroes themselves even before these things took place, as soon as
they set foot in the flames had erected their trophy, and won their
victory, and put on their crown, and had been proclaimed conquerors
both in Heaven and on earth, and so far as they were concerned
nothing was wanting for their renown. What then wouldst thou have
to say to these things? Hast thou been driven into exile, and
expelled from thy country? Behold so also were they. Hast thou
suffered captivity, and become the servant of barbarian masters.
Well! this also thou wilt find befell these men. But thou hast no
one present there to regulate thy state nor to advise or instruct
thee? Well! of attention of this kind these men were destitute. Or
thou hast been bound, burned, put to death? for thou canst not tell
me of anything more painful than these things. Yet lo! these men
having gone through them all, were made more glorious by each one
of them, yea more exceedingly illustrious, and increased the store
of their treasures in Heaven. And the Jews indeed who had both
temple, and altar, and ark and cherubim, and mercy-seat, and veil,
and an infinite multitude of priests, and daily services, and
morning and evening sacrifices, and continually heard the voices of
the prophets, both living and departed, sounding in their ears, and
carried about with them the recollection of the wonders which were
done in Egypt, and in the wilderness, and all the rest, and turned
the story of these things over in their hands, and had them
inscribed upon their door posts and enjoyed the benefit at that
time of much supernatural power and every other kind of help were
yet no wise profited, but rather damaged, having set up idols in
the temple itself, and having sacrificed their sons and daughters
under trees, and in almost every part of the country in Palestine
having offered those unlawful and accursed sacrifices, and
perpetrated countless other deeds yet more monstrous. But these men
although in the midst of a barbarous and hostile land, having their
occupation in a tyrant’s house, deprived of all that care of
which I have been speaking, led away to execution, and subjected to
burning, not only suffered no harm there from small or great, but
became the more illustrious. Knowing then these things, and
collecting instances of the like kind from the inspired divine
Scriptures (for it is possible to find many such examples in the
case of various other persons) we deem that neither a difficulty
arising from seasons or events, nor compulsion and force, nor the
arbitrary authority <pb n="284" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_284.html" id="xvi.iii-Page_284" />of
potentates furnish a sufficient excuse for us when we transgress. I
will now conclude my discourse by repeating what I said at the
beginning, that if any one be harmed and injured he certainly
suffers this at his own hands, not at the hands of others even if
there be countless multitudes injuring and insulting him: so that
if he does not suffer this at his own hands, not all the creatures
who inhabit the whole earth and sea if they combined to attack him
would be able to hurt one who is vigilant and sober in the Lord.
Let us then, I beseech you, be sober and vigilant at all times, and
let us endure all painful things bravely that we may obtain those
everlasting and pure blessings in Christ Jesus our Lord, to whom be

<p class="c9" id="xvii.ii-p2"><span class="c12" id="xvii.ii-p2.1">The</span> deaconess Olympias to
whom seventeen of Chrysostom’s extant letters are addressed was
the most eminent of his female friends. She belonged to a Pagan
family of high rank, and was born about 368. Her father Seleucus
who was a count of the Empire died when she was a young girl and
she was brought up under the guardianship of an uncle Procopius,
who has a devout Christian and a friend of Gregory of Nazianzus.
Gregory took great interest in her, speaking of her in his letters
as “his own Olympias” and delighting to be addressed by her as
“father.” Her governess Theodosia, sister of St. Amphilochius
of Iconium, was a woman whom Gregory exhorted her to imitate as the
very pattern of Christian goodness. The orphan girl had great
personal beauty, and was the heiress of a large fortune. Naturally
therefore she had many suitors, and in 384 at the age of sixteen
she was wedded to Nebridius, a young man of high rank and
irreproachable character. The marriage however does not seem to
have been a happy one, and perhaps in this fact as well as in the
death of her husband about two years after their union, Olympias
saw a divine intimation that she should not entangle herself again
in the worldly cares and anxieties incident to married life. The
Emperor Theodosius wished to unite her to a young Spaniard,
Elpidius, a kinsman of his own, and irritated by her refusal,
ordered her property to be confiscated until she should have
attained her thirtieth year, unless she consented to the proposed
union. Olympias however remained inflexible and in a letter of
dignified sarcasm thanked the Emperor for relieving her from a
heavy burden. “He could not have conferred a greater blessing
upon her unless he had ordered her wealth to be bestowed upon the
Churches and the poor.” Theodosius perceiving the uselessness, if
not regretting the injustice, of his harsh decree, cancelled it,
and left her in the undisturbed enjoyment of her property.
Henceforward her time and wealth were devoted to the service of
religion. She ministered to the necessities of the sick and poor,
and supported the work of the Church in Greece, Asia Minor and
Syria with such lavish donations, not only of her money but of her
land, that even Chrysostom, who might be called the great preacher
of almsgiving, warned her against indiscriminate liberality,
reminding her that as her wealth was a trust committed to her by
God she ought to be discreet in the management of it. This salutary
advice gained him the ill-will of many avaricious bishops and
clergy who had profited, or hoped to profit, by her gifts. She in
her turn requited the Archbishop for his spiritual care by many
little feminine attentions to his bodily wants, especially by
seeing that he was supplied with wholesome food, and did not
overstrain his feeble constitution by a too rigid abstinence. She
herself however practised the most austere asceticism, renouncing
the luxury of the bath, wearing none but old coarse clothing, and
subjecting herself to severe restrictions in respect of food and
sleep.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvii.ii-p3">After the expulsion of Chrysostom from
Constantinople 404, through the intrigues of his enemies, Olympias
suffered much from the persecution to which all his followers were
subjected. She was accused of having been concerned in causing the
fire which broke out immediately after his departure, and destroyed
the Cathedral Church and the Senate House. 
<pb n="288" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_288.html" id="xvii.ii-Page_288" />Her intrepid demeanour before the præfect who
tried in vain to frighten her into a confession of guilt, or induce
her to acknowledge Arsacius who had been intruded into the See by
an arbitrary exercise of imperial power, excited general
admiration; and the tidings of her fortitude were a great
consolation to the exiled archbishop in the midst of much bodily
suffering, and mental distress. It is not quite certain whether she
was driven from Constantinople or voluntarily retired from it; nor
have we any definite information concerning the remainder of her
life.</p>

<p class="c32" id="xvii.iii-p3"><span class="c34" id="xvii.iii-p3.1">to my lady.</span></p>

<p class="c38" id="xvii.iii-p4">The most reverend and divinely favored deaconess
Olympias, I John, Bishop, send greeting in the Lord.</p>

<p class="c9" id="xvii.iii-p5">1. <span class="c12" id="xvii.iii-p5.1">Come</span> now let me
relieve the wound of thy despondency, and disperse the thoughts
which gather this cloud of care around thee. For what is it which
upsets thy mind, and why art thou sorrowful and dejected? Is it
because of the fierce black storm which has overtaken the Church,
enveloping all things in darkness as of a night without a moon, and
is growing to a head every day, travailing to bring forth
disastrous shipwrecks, and increasing the ruin of the world? I know
all this as well as you; none shall gainsay it, and if you like I
will form an image of the things now taking place so as to present
the tragedy yet more distinctly to thee. We behold a sea upheaved
from the very lowest depths, some sailors floating dead upon the
waves, others engulfed by them, the planks of the ships breaking
up, the sails torn to tatters, the masts sprung, the oars dashed
out of the sailors’ hands, the pilots seated on the deck,
clasping their knees with their hands instead of grasping the
rudder, bewailing the hopelessness of their situation with sharp
cries and bitter lamentations, neither sky nor sea clearly visible,
but all one deep and impenetrable darkness, so that no one can see
his neighbour, whilst mighty is the roaring of the billows, and
monsters of the sea attack the crews on every side.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvii.iii-p6">But how much further shall I pursue the
unattainable? for whatever image of our present evils I may seek
speech shrinks baffled from the attempt. Nevertheless even when I
look at these calamities I do not abandon the hope of better
things, considering as I do who the pilot is in all this—not one
who gets the better of the storm by his art, but calms the raging
waters by his rod. But if He does not effect this at the outset and
speedily, such is His custom—He does not at the beginning put
down these terrible evils, but when they have increased, and come
to extremities, and most persons are reduced to despair, then He
works wondrously, and beyond all expectation, thus manifesting his
own power, and training the patience of those who undergo these
calamities. Do not therefore be cast down. For there is only one
thing, Olympias, which is really terrible, only one real trial, and
that is sin; and I have never ceased continually harping upon this
theme; but as for all other things, plots, enmities, frauds,
calumnies, insults, accusations, confiscation, exile, the keen
sword of the enemy, the peril of the deep, warfare of the whole
world, or anything else you like to name, they are but idle tales.
For whatever the nature of these things may be they are transitory
and perishable, and operate in a mortal body without doing any
injury to the vigilant soul. Therefore the blessed Paul, desiring
to prove the insignificance both of the pleasures and sorrows
relating to this life, declared the whole truth in one sentence
when he said—“For the things which are seen are temporal.”<note place="end" n="910" id="xvii.iii-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="xvii.iii-p7"> <scripRef passage="2 Cor. iv. 18" id="xvii.iii-p7.1" parsed="|2Cor|4|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.4.18">2 Cor. iv.
18</scripRef>.</p></note> Why then
dost thou fear temporal things which pass away like the stream of a
river. For such is the nature of present things whether they be
pleasant or painful. And another prophet compared all human
prosperity not to grass, but to another material even more flimsy,
describing the whole of it “as the flower of grass.” For he did
not single out any one part of it, as wealth alone, or luxury
alone, or power, or honour; but having comprised all the things
which are esteemed splendid amongst men under the one
designa<pb n="290" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_290.html" id="xvii.iii-Page_290" />tion of
glory he said “all the glory of man is as the flower of
grass.”<note place="end" n="911" id="xvii.iii-p7.2"><p class="endnote" id="xvii.iii-p8"> <scripRef passage="Is. xl. 6" id="xvii.iii-p8.1" parsed="|Isa|40|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.40.6">Is. xl.
6</scripRef>.</p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="xvii.iii-p9">2. Nevertheless, you will say, adversity is a
terrible thing and grievous to be borne. Yet look at it again
compared with another image and then also learn to despise it. For
the railings, and insults, and reproaches, and gibes inflicted by
enemies, and their plots are compared to a worn-out garment, and
moth-eaten wool when God says “Fear ye not the reproach of men,
neither be ye afraid of their revilings, for they shall wax old as
doth a garment, and like moth-eaten wool so shall they be
consumed.”<note place="end" n="912" id="xvii.iii-p9.1"><p class="endnote" id="xvii.iii-p10"> <scripRef passage="Is. l. 7, 8" id="xvii.iii-p10.1" parsed="|Isa|50|7|50|8" osisRef="Bible:Isa.50.7-Isa.50.8">Is. l. 7,
8</scripRef>.</p></note> Therefore
let none of these things which are happening trouble thee, but
ceasing to invoke the aid of this or that person, and to run after
shadows (for such are human alliances), do thou persistently call
upon Jesus, whom thou servest, merely to bow his head; and in a
moment of time all these evils will be dissolved. But if thou hast
already called upon Him, and yet they have not been dissolved, such
is the manner of God’s dealing (for I will resume my former
argument); He does not put down evils at the outset, but when they
have grown to a head, when scarcely any form of the enemy’s
malice remains ungratified, then He suddenly converts all things to
a state of tranquillity and conducts them to an unexpected
settlement. For He is not only able to turn as many things as we
expect and hope, to good, but many more, yea infinitely more.
Wherefore also Paul saith “now to Him who is able to do exceeding
abundantly above all that we ask or think.”<note place="end" n="913" id="xvii.iii-p10.2"><p class="endnote" id="xvii.iii-p11"> <scripRef passage="Ephes. iii. 20" id="xvii.iii-p11.1" parsed="|Eph|3|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Eph.3.20">Ephes.
iii. 20</scripRef>.</p></note> Could He not, for example, have
prevented the three children at the outset from falling into trial?
But He did not choose to do this, thereby conferring great pain
upon them. Therefore He suffered them to be delivered into the
hands of barbarians, and the furnace to be heated to an
immeasurable height and the wrath of the king to blaze even more
fiercely than the furnace, and hands and feet to be bound with
great severity and they themselves to be cast into the fire; and
then, when all they who beheld despaired of their rescue, suddenly,
and beyond all hope, the wonder-working power of God, the supreme
artificer, was displayed, and shone forth with exceeding splendour.
For the fire was bound, and the bondmen were released; and the
furnace became a temple of prayer, a place of fountains and dew, of
higher dignity than a royal court, and the very hairs of their head
prevailed over that all devouring element which gets the better
even of iron and stone, and masters every kind of substance. And a
solemn song of universal praise was instituted there by these holy
men inviting every kind of created thing to join in the wondrous
melody; and they uttered hymns of thanksgiving to God for that they
had been bound, and also burnt, as far at least as the malice of
their enemies had power; that they had been exiles from their
country, captives deprived of their liberty, wandering outcasts
from city and home, sojourners in a strange and barbarous land; for
all this was the outpouring of a grateful heart. And when the
malicious devices of their enemies were perfected (for what further
could they attempt after their death?) and the labours of the
heroes were completed, and the garland of victory was woven, and
their rewards were prepared and nothing more was wanting for their
renown; then at last their calamities were brought to an end, and
he who caused the furnace to be kindled, and delivered them over to
that great punishment, became himself the panegyrist of those holy
heroes, and the herald of God’s marvellous deed, and everywhere
throughout the world issued letters full of reverent praise,
recording what had taken place, and becoming the faithful herald of
the miracles wrought by the wonder-working God. For inasmuch as he
had been an enemy and adversary what he wrote was above suspicion
even in the opinion of enemies.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvii.iii-p12">3. Dost thou see the abundance of resource belonging
to God? His wisdom, His extraordinary power, His loving-kindness
and care? Be not therefore dismayed or troubled but continue to
give thanks to God for all things, praising, and invoking Him;
beseeching and supplicating; even if countless tumults and troubles
come upon thee, even if tempests are stirred up before thy eyes let
none of these things disturb thee. For our Master is not baffled by
the difficulty, even if all things are reduced to the extremity of
ruin. For it is possible for Him to raise those who have fallen, to
convert those who are in error, to set straight those who have been
ensnared, to release those who have been laden with countless sins,
and make them righteous, to quicken those who are dead, to restore
lustre to decayed things, and freshness to those which have waxen
old. For if He makes things which are not, come into being, and
bestows existence on things which are nowhere by any means
manifest, how much more will He rectify things which already exist.
But you will say there are many who perish, many who are caught by
snares. Many such things have indeed often taken place, yet
afterwards have all received their appropriate correction, save
some few who have remained in an incurable condition, even after
the change in their circumstances. Why are you troubled and
distracted because such a person is cast out and 
<pb n="291" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_291.html" id="xvii.iii-Page_291" />such another is put into his place? Christ
was crucified and the release of Barabbas the robber was demanded,
and the depraved populace clamoured for the preservation of the
murderer rather than of the Saviour and benefactor. How many think
you then stumbled at these things? how many were destroyed? But I
must carry my argument yet further back. Did not He who was
crucified become immediately after his birth a wanderer and a
fugitive? was He not from the very cradle removed with the whole
household into a strange land, taking that long journey into a
barbarous region? And this removal gave occasion to torrents of
blood, and cruel murder and slaughter, and all the children of
tender age were cut to pieces just as if they had been soldiers
arrayed in battle, and infants torn from the breast were handed
over to death, and even when the milk was in their throats, the
sword was driven through their necks. What could be more
distressing than this tragedy? And these things were done by him
who sought to destroy Jesus, yet the long-suffering God endured
this tragical cruelty, which caused so much bloodshed, and forbore
to prevent it although He had the power, displaying his
long-suffering for some inscrutably wise purpose. And when Jesus
had returned from the foreign land and was grown up, war was
rekindled against him on every side. First of all the disciples of
John were envious of Him and tried to slander Him, although John
himself behaved reverently to Him, and they said “He who was with
thee beyond Jordan, behold the same baptizeth and all men come to
Him.”<note place="end" n="914" id="xvii.iii-p12.1"><p class="endnote" id="xvii.iii-p13"> <scripRef passage="John iii. 26" id="xvii.iii-p13.1" parsed="|John|3|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.3.26">John iii.
26</scripRef>.</p></note> For these
were the words of men who were already irritated, and agitated by
ill-will, and consumed by that passion. For the same reason also
one of the disciples who said these things disputed with a certain
Jew and raised a contentious argument about purifying, comparing
one kind of baptism with another, the baptism of John with that of
the disciples of Christ. “For there arose” it is said, “a
questioning on the part of John’s disciples with a certain Jew
about purifying.”<note place="end" n="915" id="xvii.iii-p13.2"><p class="endnote" id="xvii.iii-p14"> <scripRef passage="John ii. 25" id="xvii.iii-p14.1" parsed="|John|2|25|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.2.25">John ii.

things against Him and called Him an adversary of God, and a
gluttonous, and greedy man, and a drunkard, and a friend of the
wicked and depraved. “For” He said, “the Son of man came
eating and drinking and they say behold a gluttonous man and a
wine-bibber, a friend of publicans and sinners.”<note place="end" n="919" id="xvii.iii-p17.2"><p class="endnote" id="xvii.iii-p18"> <scripRef passage="Luke vii. 34" id="xvii.iii-p18.1" parsed="|Luke|7|34|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.7.34">Luke vii.

was conversing with the harlot they called Him a false prophet;

their teeth against Him. And not only did the Jews thus oppose Him,
but even those who were reputed to be his brethren were not
sincerely attached to Him, but even out of his own family
opposition was kindled against Him. See at least how they also
themselves were perverted, from the evangelist adding the remark
“for neither did His brethren believe on Him.”<note place="end" n="921" id="xvii.iii-p19.2"><p class="endnote" id="xvii.iii-p20"> <scripRef passage="John vii. 5" id="xvii.iii-p20.1" parsed="|John|7|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.7.5">John vii.

<p class="c10" id="xvii.iii-p21">4. But since you call to mind many who were
offended and went astray, how many of the disciples do you suppose
were offended at the time of the crucifixion? One betrayed Him, the
others took to flight, one denied Him, and when all had abandoned
Him He was led away bound without companions. How many then think
you who had lately seen Him working His miracles, raising the dead,
cleansing lepers, casting out devils, multiplying loaves, and doing
all other kinds of wonderful deeds, were offended at that season,
when they beheld Him led away and bound, surrounded by common
soldiers, and followed by Jewish priests making a tumult and
uproar; alone in the midst hemmed in by all his enemies, and the
traitor standing by and exulting in his deed? And what was the
effect think you when He was being scourged? and probably a vast
multitude was present. For it was an illustrious festival which
brought all together, and this drama of iniquity was enacted in the
capital city, and in the very middle of the day. How many think you
who were present then were offended when they saw Him bound,
scourged, streaming with blood, examined before the governor’s
tribunal, and not one of His disciples standing by? What was the
effect again when He was subjected to those manifold kinds of
mockery, successively repeated, when they crowned Him with thorns,
then arrayed Him in a gorgeous robe, then put a reed in His hand,
then fell down and worshipped Him, setting in motion every species
of ribaldry and derision? How many think you were offended, how
many bewildered, how many perplexed when they smote Him on the
cheek and said “prophesy unto us thou Christ who is He that smote
thee?”<note place="end" n="922" id="xvii.iii-p21.1"><p class="endnote" id="xvii.iii-p22"> <scripRef passage="Matt. xxvi. 28" id="xvii.iii-p22.1" parsed="|Matt|26|28|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.26.28">Matt.

they led <pb n="292" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_292.html" id="xvii.iii-Page_292" />Him
hither and thither, and spent the whole day in scoffs and abuse,
and ribaldry and derision in the midst of the Jewish assembly? and
when the servant of the High-Priest dealt Him a blow; and when the
soldiers parted His garments amongst them and when He was led up to
the cross, having the marks of the scourge upon His back, and was
fastened to the wood, how many think you were offended? For not
even then were those savage beasts softened, but became more
furious than before, and the tragedy became more intense, and the
ribaldry increased. For some said “Ah! thou that destroyest the
temple, and in three days buildest it up;”<note place="end" n="923" id="xvii.iii-p22.2"><p class="endnote" id="xvii.iii-p23"> <scripRef passage="Matt. xxvii. 40" id="xvii.iii-p23.1" parsed="|Matt|27|40|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.27.40">Matt.

<p class="c10" id="xvii.iii-p25">And others said “If thou art the Son of God

<p class="c10" id="xvii.iii-p27">Again when they insulted Him by offering Him
gall and vinegar on the sponge how many think you were offended? or
when the robbers reviled Him? or when as I have already said, they
made that dreadful and monstrous assertion that the robber and
housebreaker, the man laden with the crime of murder deserved to be
released rather than Jesus, and having received permission from the
judge to make their choice preferred Barabbas, desiring not only to
crucify Christ, but also to involve Him in infamy? For they thought
that by these means they should be able to manufacture the belief
that He was worse than the robber, and such a great transgressor
that neither on the plea of mercy, nor of the privilege of the
Festival was it possible to save Him. For they did everything with
a view to slander His fame; which also was the reason why they
crucified the two robbers with Him. Nevertheless the truth was not
obscured, but shone forth all the more clearly. And they accused
Him of usurping kingly power saying “Every one who maketh himself
a king is not a friend of Cæsar”<note place="end" n="926" id="xvii.iii-p27.1"><p class="endnote" id="xvii.iii-p28"> <scripRef passage="John xix. 12" id="xvii.iii-p28.1" parsed="|John|19|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.19.12">John xix.

the sentence, which is not correctly quoted, was probably suggested
by the words immediately preceding, “if thou let this man go,
thou art not Cæsar’s friend.”</p></note> bringing this charge of usurpation
against one who had not where to lay his head. Moreover they
brought a calumnious accusation of blasphemy against Him. For the
High Priest rent his clothes saying “He hath spoken blasphemy;
what further need have we of witnesses?”<note place="end" n="927" id="xvii.iii-p28.2"><p class="endnote" id="xvii.iii-p29"> <scripRef passage="Matt. xxvi. 65" id="xvii.iii-p29.1" parsed="|Matt|26|65|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.26.65">Matt.
xxvi. 65</scripRef>.</p></note> And what was the nature of his
death? was it not a violent one? was it not the death of capital
offenders? of execrable criminals? was it not of the vilest kind?
was it not the death of those who have perpetrated the worst
offences, and are not worthy to draw even their last breath upon
the earth? And then as to the manner of his burial, was it not
accomplished as a matter of favour? For a certain one came and
begged for his body. Thus not even he who buried Him belonged to
his own friends, to those whom He had benefited, to his disciples,
to those who had enjoyed such free and salutary intercourse with
Him, for all had taken to flight, all had hurried away from Him.
And that base suspicion which his enemies contrived in consequence
of the resurrection when they said “His disciples came and stole

the prediction of the resurrection (and no wonder), inasmuch as

not know that He must rise again from the dead.”<note place="end" n="930" id="xvii.iii-p31.1"><p class="endnote" id="xvii.iii-p32"> <scripRef passage="John xx. 9" id="xvii.iii-p32.1" parsed="|John|20|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.20.9">John xx.

therefore think you were offended in those days? And yet the

<p class="c10" id="xvii.iii-p33">5. Then again after those days the disciples
continued to live in hiding and secrecy, being fugitives full of
fear and trembling, continually shifting from place to place, and
even when they began to appear after fifty days, and to work
miracles, they did not enjoy perfect security; but even after those
events there were innumerable stumbling-blocks to offend the weaker
brethren, when they were scourged, when the Church was distressed,
when they themselves were driven away, and their enemies had the
upper hand in many places, and raised tumults. For when they had
acquired much confidence by means of the miracles which they
wrought, then the death of Stephen again caused a severe
persecution, and dispersed them all, and involved the Church in
confusion; and the disciples were again alarmed, fugitive, and
distressed. And yet the Church continually grew, when it flourished
by means of the signs which were wrought and became illustrious
from the manner of its introduction. One disciple for example was
let down through a window, and so escaped the hands of the ruler;
others were brought out of prison by an angel and so released from
their fetters; others were received into the houses of common
people and artisans when they were driven out by those in
authority; they were courteously treated in every way, by female
sellers of purple, by tentmakers, and 
<pb n="293" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_293.html" id="xvii.iii-Page_293" />tanners dwelling in the outskirts of the
cities, and by the sea shore. Frequently moreover they did not dare
to appear in the middle of the towns; and if they did venture there
themselves their entertainers did not. And thus amidst alternate
trials, and respites from trial, the fabric of the Church was
wrought, and they who once stumbled were afterwards set upright,
and they who wandered away were brought back, and the ruined places
were built up more firmly than before. For this cause when Paul
prayed that the preaching of the word might proceed by a smooth
course only, God rich in wisdom and resource did not yield to His
disciple; nay even when many times invoked he would not consent but
said “my grace is sufficient for thee, for my strength is made
perfect in weakness.”<note place="end" n="931" id="xvii.iii-p33.1"><p class="endnote" id="xvii.iii-p34"> <scripRef passage="2 Cor. xii. 9" id="xvii.iii-p34.1" parsed="|2Cor|12|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.12.9">2 Cor.

<p class="c9" id="xvii.iv-p2"><span class="c12" id="xvii.iv-p2.1">Do</span> not be anxious on my
behalf, nor rack yourself with solicitude, on account of the
severity of the winter, and the weakness of my digestion, and the
incursions of the Isaurians. For the winter is only what it is wont
to be in Armenia; nothing more need be said about it; and it does
not very seriously injure me. For in anticipation of these things I
have devised many plans for averting the mischief which might arise
from them; keeping up a constant fire, setting screens about the
chamber in which I live, using a large number of rugs, and staying
always indoors. This indeed is irksome to me, if it were not for
the benefit to be derived; for as long as I remain indoors I am not
severely distressed by the cold; but if I am compelled to go out a
little, and come in contact with the outer air, I suffer no small
damage. Wherefore I beseech thee dear lady, and entreat thee as a
very great favour to pay great attention to the restoration of thy
bodily health. For dejection causes sickness; and when the body is
exhausted and enfeebled, and remains in a neglected condition,
deprived of the assistance of physicians, and of a wholesome
climate, and an abundant supply of the necessaries of life,
consider how great an aggravation of distress is occasioned
thereby. Wherefore I beseech you, dear lady, to employ various and
skilled physicians, and to take medicines which avail to correct
these conditions. For a few days ago when I suffered from a
tendency to vomiting, owing to the state of the atmosphere, I had
recourse amongst other remedies to the drug which was sent me by my
most discreet mistress Syncletion, and I found that no more than
three days’ application of it cured my infirmity. I beseech you
therefore to make use of this remedy also yourself and to arrange
that some more of it may be sent to me. For having again felt
somewhat upset, I again had recourse to it, and completely cured my
disorder; for it allays the deep internal inflammation, draws out
moisture on the skin, causes a moderate degree of warmth, infuses
no little vigor, and excites an appetite for food; and all these
effects I experienced in the course of a few days. Let then my most
honoured lord the Count Theophilus be exhorted to take means to
send some of this to me again. And do not be distressed at my
wintering here, for I am in a much more comfortable and sounder
state of health than I was last year; so that if you also would
take the requisite care of yourself, you would be in a far more
satisfactory condition. Now if you say that your ailments have been
produced by despondency how is it that you again ask for letters
from me, seeing that you have not derived any benefit from them in
the direction of cheerfulness, but have sunk so deeply under the
tyranny of despondency as even to desire to depart out of this
world. Are you ignorant how great a reward even of sickness awaits
one who has a thankful spirit? Have I not often, both in person,
and through letters, dis<pb n="294" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_294.html" id="xvii.iv-Page_294" />coursed to you concerning this
theme? But since the pressure of business perhaps, or the peculiar
nature of your sickness, and the quick succession of changes in
your condition do not permit you to retain what I have said
constantly and clearly in your mind, listen once more whilst I try
to heal the wounds of thy despondency by repeating the same
incantations: “for to write the same things,” it is said, “to
me indeed is not grievous, and for you it is safe.”<note place="end" n="932" id="xvii.iv-p2.2"><p class="endnote" id="xvii.iv-p3"> <scripRef passage="Phil. iii. 1" id="xvii.iv-p3.1" parsed="|Phil|3|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Phil.3.1">Phil. iii.

<p class="c10" id="xvii.iv-p4">2. What is it then which I say and write?
Nothing, Olympias, redounds so much to the credit of any one as
patient endurance in suffering. For this is indeed the queen of
virtues, and the perfection of crowns; and as it excels all other
forms of righteousness, so this particular species of it is more
glorious than the rest. Perhaps what I have said seems obscure; I
will therefore try to make it clearer. What then is it that I
affirm? Not the spoliation of goods, even if one were to be
stripped bare of all one’s possessions, not the loss of honours,
nor expulsion from one’s country, and transportation to a distant
land, nor the strain of labour and toil, nor imprisonment, and
bondage, nor reproaches, and abuse, and scoffings (not indeed that
you are to think the courageous endurance of such things a slight
kind of fortitude, as Jeremiah that great and eminent prophet
proves who was not a little distressed by this kind of trial);<note place="end" n="933" id="xvii.iv-p4.1"><p class="endnote" id="xvii.iv-p5"> <scripRef passage="Jer. xv" id="xvii.iv-p5.1" parsed="|Jer|15|0|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Jer.15">Jer.
xv</scripRef>.</p></note> yet not even
this, nor the loss of children, even should they be torn from us in
one fell swoop, nor the perpetual assaults of enemies, nor anything
else of that nature, no, nor even the head and crown of things
accounted painful, namely death, terrible and loathsome though it
be, is so oppressive as infirmity of body. And this is proved by
the greatest hero of endurance,<note place="end" n="934" id="xvii.iv-p5.2"><p class="endnote" id="xvii.iv-p6"> Sc. Job.</p></note> who, when he was encompassed by
bodily sickness, thought death would be a release from the
calamities which were depressing him; and when he underwent all the
other sufferings, was not sensible of them, although he received
blow after blow, and at last a deadly one. For it was no slight
matter, but rather an evidence of the most malignant cruelty on the
part of his enemy in dealing with one who was no novice in
suffering, nor entering the lists for the first time, but already
exhausted with the frequent repetition of assaults, to inflict upon
him that deadly blow, the destruction of his children, so cruelly
inflicted moreover that all of either sex were destroyed at the
same moment in early youth and by a violent end, and so
instantaneous was their death that it involved their burial also.
For their father neither saw them laid upon abed, nor kissed their
hands, nor heard their last words, nor touched their hands and
knees, nor did he shut their mouths, or close their eyes when they
were about to die, acts which tend not a little to console parents
who are being parted from their children; neither did he follow
some of them to burial, and find others on his return home to
console him for those who had departed; but he heard that as they
were reclining on their couches at a banquet, a banquet full of
love, not of excess, a table of brotherly kindness, they were all
overwhelmed; and blood, and wine, the cups and the ceiling, the
table, and the dust, and the limbs of his children, were all
mingled together. Nevertheless when he heard these things, and
others before these which were also distressing; for they too had
perished in a distressing way; flocks and whole herds had been
destroyed, the latter having been consumed by fire sent down from
heaven, (so said the evil messenger of this tragedy,) and the
former having been all seized together by various enemies, and cut
to pieces as well as the shepherds themselves; nevertheless I say
when he saw this great storm stirred up in a brief moment of time
affecting his lands, his house, his cattle, and his children, when
he saw billow following billow, and long lines of rocks, and the
darkness was profound, and the surging waves unbearable, even then
he was not tortured by despondency, and scarcely seemed to feel the
things which had happened, save so far as he was a man and a
father. But when he was delivered over to sickness and sores, then
did he also long for death, then did he also bewail himself and
lament, so that you may understand how this kind of suffering is
more severe than all others, and this form of patience the highest
of all. Nor is the Devil himself unaware of this fact; for when
after having set in motion all these trials he perceived that the
hero remained untroubled and undismayed he rushed to this as the
greatest contest of all, saying that all the other calamities were
bearable, as loss of child, or property, or anything else (for this
is what is meant by the expression “skin for skin”<note place="end" n="935" id="xvii.iv-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="xvii.iv-p7"> <scripRef passage="Job ii. 4" id="xvii.iv-p7.1" parsed="|Job|2|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Job.2.4">Job ii.
4</scripRef>.</p></note>) but the
deadly blow was when pain was inflicted on a man’s body. And
therefore when he had been worsted after this contest, he had no
longer a word to utter, although on former occasions he had made
the most strenuous and shameless resistance. In this instance
however he found that he could not invent any further shameless
device, but hid his face and retreated.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvii.iv-p8">3. Think not however that it is an excuse <pb n="295" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_295.html" id="xvii.iv-Page_295" />to justify you in desiring
death, that Job desired it, not being able to bear his sufferings.
For consider the time when he desired it, and the disposition of
his circumstances—the law was not given, the prophets had not
appeared, grace had not been shed forth as it was afterwards, nor
had he the advantage of any other kind of philosophy. For as a
proof that more is demanded from us than from those who lived then,
and that harder tasks are assigned to us, listen to Christ, when He
says “Except your righteousness exceed the righteousness of the
Scribes and Pharisees ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of
Heaven.”<note place="end" n="936" id="xvii.iv-p8.1"><p class="endnote" id="xvii.iv-p9"> <scripRef passage="Matt. v. 20" id="xvii.iv-p9.1" parsed="|Matt|5|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.20">Matt. v.

therefore that to pray for death now is exempt from blame, but
hearken to the voice of St. Paul when he says “To depart and to
be with Christ is far better, but to abide in the flesh is more
necessary for your sake.”<note place="end" n="937" id="xvii.iv-p9.2"><p class="endnote" id="xvii.iv-p10"> <scripRef passage="Phil. i. 23, 24" id="xvii.iv-p10.1" parsed="|Phil|1|23|1|24" osisRef="Bible:Phil.1.23-Phil.1.24">Phil. i.
23, 24</scripRef>.</p></note> For in proportion as the strain of
the affliction is increased are the garlands of victory multiplied;
in proportion as the gold is heated does it become purified, the
longer the merchant makes his voyage on the sea, the larger is the
freight which he collects. Do not then think that the labour now
allotted to you is a slight one, but rather that it is higher than
all which you have undergone, I mean that which consists in
infirmity of body. For in the case of Lazarus<note place="end" n="938" id="xvii.iv-p10.2"><p class="endnote" id="xvii.iv-p11"> <scripRef passage="Luke xvi" id="xvii.iv-p11.1" parsed="|Luke|16|0|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.16">Luke
xvi</scripRef>.</p></note> (and although I may have often said
this to you, it nowise hinders me from saying it now) this bodily
infirmity availed for his salvation; and he departed to the bosom
of the man who possessed a dwelling which he shared with all who
passed by,<note place="end" n="939" id="xvii.iv-p11.2"><p class="endnote" id="xvii.iv-p12"> Referring to the hospitality of Abraham as
illustrated by his reception of the divine visitors, <scripRef passage="Gen. xviii" id="xvii.iv-p12.1" parsed="|Gen|18|0|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.18">Gen. xviii</scripRef>.</p></note> and was
continually shifting his home on account of God’s command, and
sacrificed his own son, his only begotten, who had been given him
in extreme old age; although Lazarus had done none of these things
yet he obtained this blessing inasmuch as he cheerfully endured
poverty, and infirmity, and friendlessness. For this is so great a
good to those who bear anything bravely that it releases any one
who may have committed the greatest sins from the heaviest burden
of them; or if any one is an upright and just man it becomes an
additional ground of the greatest confidence. For it is a bright
wreath of victory for the just, shining far above the brightness of
the sun, and it is the greatest means of purification for those who
have sinned. On this account Paul delivers the man who had made the
incestuous marriage to “destruction of the flesh,” purifying
him by this means. For as a proof that what was done did purify
even from so great a stain hear his words “that his spirit may be
saved in the day of the Lord.”<note place="end" n="940" id="xvii.iv-p12.2"><p class="endnote" id="xvii.iv-p13"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. v. 5" id="xvii.iv-p13.1" parsed="|1Cor|5|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.5.5">1 Cor. v.

another very awful sin, that of partaking unworthily of the holy
table and those secret mysteries, and had said that such a person
will be “guilty of the body and blood of the Lord,”<note place="end" n="941" id="xvii.iv-p13.2"><p class="endnote" id="xvii.iv-p14"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. xi. 27" id="xvii.iv-p14.1" parsed="|1Cor|11|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.11.27">1 Cor. xi.

he says that they also are purified from that grievous
stain—“therefore are many weak and sickly among you.”<note place="end" n="942" id="xvii.iv-p14.2"><p class="endnote" id="xvii.iv-p15"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. xi. 30" id="xvii.iv-p15.1" parsed="|1Cor|11|30|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.11.30">1 Cor. xi.
30</scripRef>.</p></note> And then by
way of proving that they will not be confined to this condition of
punishment, but that some profit will be derived from it, namely
release from the penalties to which the sin is liable, he added:
“for if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged. But
now when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we
should not be condemned with the world.”<note place="end" n="943" id="xvii.iv-p15.2"><p class="endnote" id="xvii.iv-p16"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. xi. 31, 32" id="xvii.iv-p16.1" parsed="|1Cor|11|31|11|32" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.11.31-1Cor.11.32">1 Cor. xi.
31, 32</scripRef>.</p></note> Moreover that they who have lived
very righteously derive much benefit from such chastisement is
plain from the case of Job, who was more illustrious after it than
before, and from the case of Timothy, who although he was such a
good man, and entrusted with such an important ministry, and made
the circuit of the world with Paul passed not two or three days,
nor ten or twenty, or a hundred, but many in succession in ill
health, his body being very seriously enfeebled. Paul shows this
where he said “Use a little wine for thy stomach’s sake, and
thine often infirmities.”<note place="end" n="944" id="xvii.iv-p16.2"><p class="endnote" id="xvii.iv-p17"> <scripRef passage="1 Tim. v. 23" id="xvii.iv-p17.1" parsed="|1Tim|5|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.5.23">1 Tim. v.

cure this man’s infirmity, but left him in the furnace of his
sickness so that he might therefrom contract a very great abundance
of confidence. For the lessons which Paul himself had enjoyed from
his Master, and the training which he had received from Him, he
imparted to his disciple. For although he was not subjected to
bodily infirmity, yet he was buffeted by trials not less severe,
which inflicted much physical pain. “For there was given unto
me” he says “a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to
buffet me”<note place="end" n="945" id="xvii.iv-p17.2"><p class="endnote" id="xvii.iv-p18"> <scripRef passage="2 Cor. xii. 7" id="xvii.iv-p18.1" parsed="|2Cor|12|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.12.7">2 Cor.

some painful bodily infirmity, perhaps weakness of eyesight (see
<scripRef passage="Gal. iv. 19" id="xvii.iv-p18.3" parsed="|Gal|4|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gal.4.19">Gal. iv. 19</scripRef>) than the indignities to which
he was subjected.</p></note> meaning by
this the blows, the bonds, the chains, the imprisonments, the being
dragged about, and maltreated, and tortured by the scourges of
public executioners. Wherefore also being unable to bear the pain
occasioned to the body by these things “for this I besought the
Lord thrice (thrice here meaning many times) that I might be
delivered from this thorn.” And then when he did not obtain his
petition, having learned the benefit of the trial, he held his
peace, and rejoiced at the things which happened unto
him.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvii.iv-p19">Therefore even if you remain at home, and are set
fast in bed, do not consider your life 
<pb n="296" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_296.html" id="xvii.iv-Page_296" />an idle one; for you undergo more severe pains
than those who are dragged, and maltreated, and tortured by
executioners, inasmuch as in this excessive infirmity of yours you
have a perpetual executioner residing with you.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvii.iv-p20">4. Do not then now desire death, nor neglect
the means of cure; for indeed this would not be safe. On this
account Paul also exhorts Timothy to take the greatest care of
himself. As regards infirmity then enough has now been said. But if
it is separation from me which causes your despondency expect
release from this. And I have not said this now merely to encourage
you, but I am sure that it really will be the case. For if it were
not destined to happen, I should long ago, so at least I think,
have departed from this world, considering the trials which have
been inflicted on me. For to pass over all that occurred in
Constantinople, after my departure thence, you may understand what
sufferings I endured on that long and cruel journey, most of which
were sufficient to produce death; what I endured after my arrival
here, after my removal from Cucusus, and after my sojourn in
Arabissus. Yet I have survived all these things, and now I am in
sound health, and great security, so that all Armenians are
astonished that with such a feeble and flimsy frame as mine I can
support such an intolerable amount of cold, or that I can breathe
at all, when those who are habituated to the winter are suffering
from it in no common degree. Nevertheless I have remained uninjured
up to the present day, having escaped the hands of robbers who have
repeatedly attacked us, and yet in daily want of the necessaries of
life, and deprived of the use of a bath; and although since my
sojourn here I have been constantly without this luxury I am now so
established in the habit that I do not even long for the comfort to
be derived from it, but am in sounder health than before. And
neither the inclemency of the climate, nor the desolation of the
region, nor the scarcity of provisions, nor the lack of attendants,
nor the unskillfulness of physicians, nor the deprivation of the
bath, nor perpetual confinement in one chamber as in a prison, and
the impossibility of moving about which I always used continually
to need, nor perpetual contact with fire and smoke, nor fear of
robbers, nor a constant state of siege, nor anything else of this
kind has got the better of me; on the contrary I am in a sounder
condition of health than I was elsewhere, although I then received
great care and attention. Taking all these things then into
consideration pray shake off the despondency which now oppresses
you, and do not exact inordinate and cruel penances from yourself.
I sent you the treatise which I have lately written, that “no one
can harm the man who does not injure himself,”<note place="end" n="946" id="xvii.iv-p20.1"><p class="endnote" id="xvii.iv-p21"> Translated in this volume, see pages 270–284.</p></note> and the letter which I now send
your honour contends for the same position. I beg you therefore to
go over it constantly, and if your health permits you, recite it
aloud. For if you will, it may prove an effectual remedy for you.
But if you are contentious with me, and do not try to cure
yourself, and will not rouse yourself from these dismal swamps of
despondency in spite of the unlimited amount of advice and
exhortation which you enjoy I shall not on my part readily consent
to send you frequent and long letters, if you are not to derive any
benefit in the way of cheerfulness from them. How then shall I know
this? not by your merely saying so, but by a practical proof,
inasmuch as you lately affirmed that it was nothing but despondency
which caused this sickness of yours. Since then you have yourself
made this confession I shall not believe that you have got rid of
your despondency unless you have got rid of your bodily infirmity.
For if it is the former which causes your disorder, as you say in
your letter, it is obvious that when that has been dispersed the
other will be removed at the same time, and when the root has been
plucked up, the branches perish with it;—and if the branches
continue flowering and flourishing, and producing an unnatural
amount of fruit I cannot believe that you have been set free from
the root of your distress. Therefore do not show me words but
facts, and, if you get well, you will see letters sent to you again
exceeding the limits of former communications. Deem it then no
small consolation that I am alive, and in good health, and that in
the midst of such circumstances I have been set free from sickness
and infirmity, which, as I know, is a great annoyance and vexation
to my enemies. It follows therefore that you should deem this the
greatest encouragement, and the crown of your consolation. Do not
call your household desolate, which has now a higher place assigned
to it in Heaven by reason of the sufferings which it endures. I was
grievously distressed on account of Pelagius the monk.<note place="end" n="947" id="xvii.iv-p21.1"><p class="endnote" id="xvii.iv-p22"> If Pelagius the heresiarch were the person here
alluded to, this would be the earliest historical notice of him.
But as Pelagius was in Rome from 401 to 409, during which period he
is mentioned with respect by his contemporaries, and this letter
must have been written not later than 405 or 406, the
identification is impossible.</p></note> Consider
therefore what great rewards they deserve who bravely hold their
ground, when men who pass their time in such a habit of discipline
and endurance are found susceptible of degradation.</p>

<p class="c9" id="xvii.v-p2"><span class="c12" id="xvii.v-p2.1">Having</span> risen from the very
gates of death I address this letter to the discreet lady; and I am
very glad that thy servants have met me just as I am anchoring at
last in harbour. For had they met me when I was still tossing on
the open sea, and experiencing the cruel waves of bodily sickness,
it would not have been easy for me to deceive your cautious spirit,
by sending good tidings instead of sorrowful. For the winter, which
has become more than commonly severe, brought on a storm of
internal disorder even more distressing, and during the last two
months I have been no better than one dead, nay worse. For I had
just enough life to be sensible of the horrors which encircled me,
and day and dawn and noon were all one night to me as I spent all
my time closely confined to my bed, and in spite of endless
contrivances I could not shake off the pernicious effects of the
cold; but although I kept a fire burning, and endured a most
unpleasant amount of smoke, and remained cooped up in one chamber,
covered with any quantity of wraps, and not daring to set a foot
outside the threshold I underwent extreme sufferings, perpetual
vomiting supervening on headache, loss of appetite, and constant
sleeplessness. Thus restlessly did I pass through my long dark sea
of troubles. But not to distress thy mind by dwelling upon my
miseries, from all of them I am now relieved. For as soon as spring
approached, and a little change in the temperature took place, all
my troubles spontaneously vanished. Nevertheless I still require
great care as regards diet; therefore I put only a light load on my
stomach, so that it may be able to digest it easily. But it has
occasioned me no little concern to learn that my discreet mistress
was brought to the verge of death. Nevertheless in consideration of
my great affection, and anxiety, and solicitude for your welfare I
was relieved from this care, even before the arrival of your
letters, many persons having come from thence who brought me
tidings of your restoration to health.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvii.v-p3">And now I am exceedingly glad and delighted to
hear, not only that you have been released from your infirmity, but
above all that you bear the things which befall you so bravely,
calling them all but an idle tale; and, which is indeed a greater
matter, that you have applied this name even to your bodily
infirmity, which is an evidence of a robust spirit, rich in the
fruit of courage. For not only to bear misfortunes bravely but to
be actually insensible to them, to overlook them, and with such
little exertion to wreathe your brows with the garland prize of
patience, neither labouring, nor toiling, neither feeling distress
nor causing it to others, but as it were leaping and dancing for
joy all the while, this is indeed a proof of the most finished
philosophy.<note place="end" n="948" id="xvii.v-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="xvii.v-p4"> Here, as often elsewhere, St. Chrysostom uses the
word φιλοσοφία in the sense of Christian
training and moral discipline. The monastic form of life was
commonly called ἡ 
φιλοσοφιὰ, the “philosophy.”</p></note> Therefore I
rejoice, and leap for joy; I am in a flutter of delight, I am
insensible to my present loneliness, and the other troubles which
surround me, being cheered, and brightened, and not a little proud
on account of your greatness of soul, and the repeated victories
which you have won, and this, not only for your own sake, but also
for the sake of that large and populous city,<note place="end" n="949" id="xvii.v-p4.1"><p class="endnote" id="xvii.v-p5"> Sc. Constantinople.</p></note> where you are like a tower, a
haven, and a wall of defence, speaking in the eloquent voice of
example, and through your sufferings instructing either sex to
strip readily for these contests, and descend into the lists with
all courage, and cheerfully bear the toils which such contests
involve. And the wonder is that without thrusting yourself into the
forum, or occupying the public centres of the city, but sitting all
the while in a small house and confined chamber you serve and
anoint the combatants for the contest, and whilst the sea is thus
raging round you, and the billows are rising to a crest, and crags
and reefs, and rocky ledges and fierce monsters appear on every
side, and everything is shrouded in the most profound darkness you,
setting the sails of patience, float on with great serenity, as if
it was noonday, and calm weather, and a favourable breeze wafting
you on, and so far from being overwhelmed by this grievous tempest
are not even sprinkled by the spray; and very naturally so; such is
the force of virtue as a rudder. Now merchants and pilots, and
sailors and voyagers when they see clouds gathering up, or fierce
winds rushing down upon them, or the breakers seething with an
abundance of foam keep their vessels moored inside harbour; and if
they chance to be tempest-tossed in the open sea they do their
best, and devise every means to bring their ship to some anchorage,
or island or shore. But you, although such innumerable winds, and
fierce waves burst upon you together, and the sea is heaved up from
its very depths owing to the severity of the storm, and some are
submerged, others floating dead upon the water, others drifting
naked upon planks, you plunging into the mid ocean of calamities
call all these things an idle tale, sailing on with a favourable
breeze in the midst of the tempest; and naturally so; for pilots,
even if they are infinitely wise in that science, nevertheless have
not skill sufficient to withstand every kind <pb n="298" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_298.html" id="xvii.v-Page_298" />of storm; consequently they often
shrink from doing battle with the waves. But the science which you
have is superior to every kind of storm—the power of a
philosophic soul—which is stronger than ten thousand armies, more
powerful than arms, and more secure than towers and bulwarks. For
the arms, and bulwarks, and towers which soldiers have, are
serviceable for the security of the body only, and this not always,
nor in every way; but there are times when all these resources are
baffled, and leave those who fly to them for refuge destitute of
protection. But thy powers do not repel the weapons of barbarians,
nor the devices of hostile men, nor any assaults and stratagems of
that kind, but they have trampled under foot the constraining
forces of nature, put down their tyranny and levelled their
citadel. And whilst ceaselessly contending with demons, you have
won countless victories, yet have not received a single blow, but
stand unwounded in the midst of a storm of darts and turn the
spears which are hurled at you back upon those who discharge them.
Such is the wisdom of your art; by the sufferings which you undergo
you take vengeance on those who inflict them; by the plots of which
you are the subject you put your enemies to pain, possessing in
their malice the best foundation for the materials of fame. And
you, knowing these things well yourself, and having gained
perception by experience, naturally call them all an idle tale. For
how, pray, should you not call them by that name, possessing as you
do a mortal body, and yet despising death as if you were hastening
to quit a foreign country, and return to your own land; a chronic
sufferer from the most severe infirmity, and yet more cheerfully
disposed than the thriving and robust, not depressed by insults,
nor elated by honours and glory, the latter being a cause of
infinite mischief to many who after an illustrious career in the
priesthood, and after reaching extreme old age, and the most
venerable hoar hairs, have fallen into disgrace on this account,
and become a common spectacle of derision for those who wish to
make merry. But you on the contrary, woman as you are, clothed with
a fragile body, and subject to these severe attacks, have not only
avoided falling into such a condition yourself, but have prevented
many others from so doing. They indeed before they had advanced far
in the contest, even at the very outset and starting point, have
been overthrown; whereas you, after having gone countless times
round the farther turning post, have won a prize in every course,
after playing your part in manifold kinds of wrestling and combats.
And very naturally so; for the wrestlings of virtue do not depend
upon age, or bodily strength, but only on the spirit and the
disposition. Thus women have been crowned victors, while men have
been upset; so also boys have been proclaimed conquerors, while
aged men have been put to shame. It is indeed always fitting to
admire those who pursue virtue, but especially when some are found
to cling to it at a time when many are deserting it. Therefore, my
sweet lady, you deserve superlative admiration, inasmuch as after
so many men, women, and aged persons who seemed to enjoy the
greatest reputation have been turned to flight, all lying prostrate
before the eyes of the world, and this not after a severe
onslaught, nor any alarming muster of the enemy’s force, but
overthrown before the encounter and worsted before the struggle,
you on the contrary after so many battles and such large muster of
the enemy are so far from being unstrung, or dismayed by the number
of your adversities, that you are all the more vigorous, and the
increase of the contest gives you an increase of strength. For the
recollection of what has been already achieved becomes the ground
of cheerfulness, and joy, and greater zeal. Therefore I rejoice,
and leap for joy; for I will not cease repeating this, and taking
about with me everywhere the material of my joy; so that although
my separation from you distresses you, yet you have this very great
consolation arising from your successful exploits; for I also who
am banished to so great a distance gain no small cheerfulness from
this cause,—I mean your courage.</p>

<span class="c34" id="xvii.vi-p1.1">to olympias.</span></p>

<p class="c9" id="xvii.vi-p2"><span class="c12" id="xvii.vi-p2.1">Why</span> do you lament? why do
you belabour yourself, and demand of yourself a punishment which
your enemies were not able to demand from you, having thus
abandoned your soul to the tyranny of dejection? For the letters
which you sent to me by the hands of Patricius have discovered to
me the wounds which have been inflicted on your mind. Wherefore
also I am very sorrowful and much distressed that when you ought to
be using every exertion and making it your business to expel
dejection from your soul, you go about collecting distressing
thoughts, even inventing things (so you say) which do not exist,
and tearing yourself to pieces for no purpose, and to your very
great injury. For why are you grieved because you could not remove
me from Cucusus? Yet indeed, as far as you were concerned, you did
remove me, having made every exertion and endeavour for this
purpose. And even if it has not been actually accomplished you
ought not to be vexed on 
<pb n="299" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_299.html" id="xvii.vi-Page_299" />that account. For perhaps it seemed good to
God that I should be set to run the longer double course,<note place="end" n="950" id="xvii.vi-p2.2"><p class="endnote" id="xvii.vi-p3"> The single course in the Grecian games was the
stadium, so called because it was a stade in length. In the double
course the runner had to turn the post at the extremity of the
stadium and run back again.</p></note> in order
that the garland of victory might be rendered more glorious. Why
then are you vexed on account of these things, in consequence of
which my fame is spread abroad, when you ought to leap and dance
for joy and bind wreaths upon your brow, because I have been deemed
worthy of so great an honour which far exceeds my merits? Is it the
desolation of this place which grieves you? Yet what can be
pleasanter than my sojourn here? I have quietness, and
tranquillity, plenty of leisure and good bodily health. For
although the town has neither market-place nor market that is
nothing to me. For all things are poured abundantly upon me as out
of a flowing spring. I find my lord the Bishop here and my lord
Dioscorus are constantly employed in providing for my refreshment.
And the good Patricius will tell you that as far as my sojourn here
is concerned I pass my time cheerfully and gladly, surrounded by
attention. But if you lament the events which occurred in Cæsarea,
here again your conduct is unworthy of yourself. For there also
bright garlands of victory were woven for me, inasmuch as all were
proclaiming and publishing my praises, and expressing wonder and
astonishment at the ill-treatment to which I had been subjected
followed by expulsion. Meanwhile however do not let any one know
these things, although they are the theme of much gossip. For my
lord Pœanius has disclosed to me that the presbyters of Pharetrius
himself<note place="end" n="951" id="xvii.vi-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="xvii.vi-p4"> Pharetrius was Bishop of Cæsarea, and, as the
sequel shows, a malicious enemy of Chrysostom.</p></note> have arrived
on the spot, who declare that they were in communion with me and
had no communication or intercourse or partnership with my
adversaries. Therefore to avoid upsetting them do not let any one
know these things. For certainly the things which befell me were
very grievous: and if I had not suffered any other distress the
events which happened there would have sufficed to procure
innumerable rewards for me: so extreme was the danger which I
encountered. Now I beseech you to keep these matters secret, and so
I will give you a short account of them, not in order to grieve you
but rather to make you glad. For herein consists the material of my
gain, herein consists my wealth, herein the means of getting rid of
my sins—that my journey is continually encompassed by trials of
this kind, and that they are inflicted upon me by persons from whom
they were quite unexpected. For when I was about to enter the
region of Cappadocia, having escaped from that man of Galatia, who
nearly threatened me with death,<note place="end" n="952" id="xvii.vi-p4.1"><p class="endnote" id="xvii.vi-p5"> Probably Leontius, Archbishop of Ancyra in Galatia,
a bitter adversary of Chrysostom.</p></note> many persons met me on the way
saying “the lord Pharetrius is awaiting you, and going about in
all directions for fear of missing the pleasure of meeting you, and
making every possible endeavour to see you, and embrace you, and
show you all manner of affectionate regard; and he has set the
monasteries of men and women in motion for this purpose.” Now
when I heard these things I did not expect that any of them would
really take place, but formed an impression in my own mind
precisely the reverse: but of this I said nothing to any of those
who brought me this message.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvii.vi-p6">2. Now when I arrived late one evening at
Cæsarea, in an exhausted and worn-out condition, being in the very
height of a burning fever, faint and suffering to the last degree,
I lighted upon an inn situated just at the outskirts of the city,
and took great pains to find some physicians and allay this fiery
fever; for it was now the height of my tertian malady. And in
addition to this there was the fatigue of the journey, the toil,
the strain, the total absence of attendants, the difficulty of
getting supplies, the want of a physician, the wasting effects of
toil, and heat and sleeplessness; thus I was well nigh a dead man
when I entered the city. Then indeed I was visited by the whole
body of the clergy, and the people, monks, nuns, physicians, and I
had the benefit of great attention, as all paid me every kind of
ministration and assistance. Yet even thus, being oppressed by the
lethargy arising from the feverish heat I was in an extremely
distressed condition. At length by degrees the malady was coming to
an end and abating. Pharetrius however nowhere appeared; but waited
for my departure, I know not with what purpose in view. When then I
saw that my disorder had slightly abated I began to form plans for
my journey so as to reach Cucusus, and enjoy a little repose after
the calamities of the way. And whilst I was thus situated it was
suddenly announced that the Isaurians<note place="end" n="953" id="xvii.vi-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="xvii.vi-p7"> A predatory race of barbarians who inhabited the
fastnesses of Mount Taurus.</p></note> in countless multitudes were
overrunning the district of Cæsarea, and had burnt a large
village, and were most violently disposed. The tribune, having
heard this, took the soldiers which he had and went out. For they
were afraid lest the enemy should make an assault also upon
<pb n="300" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_300.html" id="xvii.vi-Page_300" />the city, and all were in
terror, and in an agony of alarm the very soil of their country
being in jeopardy, so that even the old men undertook the defence
of the walls. While affairs were in this condition suddenly towards
dawn a rabble<note place="end" n="954" id="xvii.vi-p7.1"><p class="endnote" id="xvii.vi-p8"> There are many instances in the early history of
the Eastern Church of similar fanatical fury on the part of
monks.</p></note> of monks
(for so I must call them, indicating their frenzy by the
expression) rushed up to the house where we were, threatening to
set fire to it, and to treat us with the utmost violence unless we
turned out of it. And neither the fear of the Isaurians, nor my own
infirmity which was so grievously afflicting me, nor anything else
made them more reasonable, but they pressed on, animated by such
fierce rage that even the proconsular soldiers were terrified. For
they kept threatening them with blows and boasted that they had
shamefully beaten many of the proconsular soldiers. The soldiers
having heard these things, sought refuge with me, and entreated and
beseeched me, saying “even if we are to fall into the hands of
the Isaurians deliver us from these wild beasts.” When the
governor heard this he hastened down to the house intending to
succour me. But the monks would not pay any heed to his
exhortations, and in fact he was powerless. Perceiving the great
strait in which affairs were placed and not daring to advise me
either to go out to certain death, or on the other hand to stay
indoors, owing to the excessive fury of these men, he sent to
Pharetrius beseeching him to grant a few days respite on account of
my infirmity and the impending danger. But even then nothing was
effected, and on the morrow the monks arrived even fiercer than
before, and none of the presbyters dared to stand by me and help
me, but covered with shame and blushes (for they said that these
things were done by the instructions of Pharetrius) they concealed
themselves and lay hid, not responding even when I called them.
What need to make a long story? Although such great terrors were
imminent, and death well nigh a certainty, and the fever was
oppressing me (for I had not yet got relief from the troubles
arising from that cause) I flung myself at high noon into the
litter, and was carried out thence, all the people shrieking and
howling, and imprecating curses on the perpetrator of these deeds,
whilst every one wailed and lamented. But when I got outside the
city, some of the clergy also gradually came out and escorted me,
mourning as they went. And having heard some persons say “Where
are you leading him away to manifest death?” one of those who was
warmly attached to me said to me “Depart I entreat you; fall into
the hands of the Isaurians, provided you get clear away from us.
For wherever you may fall, you will fall into a place of security,
if only you escape our hands.” Having heard and seen these things
the good Seleucia, the generous wife of my lord Ruffinus (a most
attentive friend she was to me), exhorted and entreated me to lodge
at her suburban house which was about five miles from the city and
she sent some men to escort me, and so I departed
thither.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvii.vi-p9">3. But not even there was this plot against me to
come to an end. For as soon as Pharetrius knew what she had done,
he published, as she said, many threats against her. But when she
received me into her suburban villa I knew nothing of these things;
for when she came out to meet me she concealed these things from
me, but disclosed them to her steward who was there, and ordered
him to afford me every possible means of repose, and if any of the
monks should make an assault, wishing to insult or maltreat me, he
was to collect the labourers from her other farms, and thus marshal
a force against them. Moreover she besought me to take refuge in
her house, which had a fortress and was impregnable, that I might
escape the hands of the bishop and monks. This however I could not
be induced to do, but remained in the villa, knowing nothing of the
plans which were devised after these things. For even then they
were not content to desist from their fury against me but
Pharetrius beset the lady as she says, straitly threatening her,
constraining and forcing her to expel me even from the suburbs, so
that at midnight, I knowing nothing of these things, the lady being
unable to endure his annoyance, announced, without my knowledge,
that the barbarians were at hand, for she was ashamed to mention
the compulsion which she had undergone. So in the middle of the
night Evethius the presbyter came to me, and having roused me from
sleep, exclaimed with a loud voice “Get up, I pray you, the
barbarians are upon us, they are close at hand.” Imagine my
condition on hearing this! Then, when I said to him what must we
do? we cannot take refuge in the city lest we suffer worse things
than what the Isaurians are going to do to us, he compelled me to
go out. It was midnight, a dark, murky night without a moon—a
circumstance which filled up the measure of our perplexity—we had
no companion, no assistant, for all had deserted us. Nevertheless
under the pressure of fear and in the expectation of immediate
death, I got up, suffering as I was, having ordered <pb n="301" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_301.html" id="xvii.vi-Page_301" />torches to be lit. These however the
presbyter ordered to be put out, for fear as he said lest the
barbarians should be attracted by the light and attack us; so the
torches were extinguished. Then the mule which carried my litter
fell on its knees, the road being rugged, and steep and stony, and
I who was inside was thrown down and narrowly escaped destruction,
after which I dismounted, and was dragged along on foot, being held
fast by Evethius the presbyter (for he also had alighted from his
mule), and so I plodded on, led, or rather hauled by the hand, for
to walk was impossible through such a difficult country, and
amongst steep mountains in the middle of the night. Imagine what my
sufferings must have been, encompassed as I was by such calamities,
and oppressed by the fever, ignorant of the plans which had been
made, but in terror of the barbarians and trembling. with the
expectation of falling into their hands. Do you not think that
these sufferings alone, even if nothing else besides had befallen
me, would avail to blot out many of my sins, and afford ample
material for obtaining praise with God? Now the reason of all this,
at least as I suppose, was, that as soon as I arrived in Cæsarea,
those who were in official positions, the learned men who were
ex-vicars, and ex-governors, the ex-tribunes and indeed the whole
people visited me every day, paid me great attention, and treated
me as the apple of their eye; I suppose these things irritated
Pharetrius and that the envy which drove me from Constantinople did
not refrain from pursuing me even here. This at least is what I
suppose, for I do not positively declare it but only suspect it to
be the fact.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvii.vi-p10">And what is one to say about the other events which
happened on the way, the fears and the perils? as I recall them day
by day, and continually bear them in mind, I am elated with
pleasure, I leap for joy as one who has a great treasure laid up in
store for him; for such is my position and feeling about them.
Wherefore also I beseech your Honour to rejoice at these things, to
be glad, and leap for joy, and to glorify God who has counted me
worthy to suffer such things. And I beseech you to keep these
matters to yourself, and not to divulge them to any one, although
for the most part the proconsular soldiers can fill all the city
(with the story) as they themselves have undergone extreme
danger.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvii.vi-p11">4. Nevertheless do not let any one know this from
your prudence, but rather put down those who talk about it. But if
you are distressed lest the consequences of my ill-treatment should
remain, know for certain that I have shaken myself entirely free
from them, and that I am in better bodily health than when I was
sojourning in Cæsarea. And why do you dread the cold? for a
suitable dwelling has been prepared for me, and my lord Dioscorus
does and arranges everything so as to prevent my having the least
sensation of cold. And if I may form a conjecture from the outset
of my experience, the climate now seems to me oriental in
character, no less than that of Antioch. So great is the warmth, so
pleasant is the temperature. But you have grieved me much by
saying, “perhaps you are annoyed with me as having neglected
you,” yet I despatched a letter many days ago to your honour
begging you not to move me from this place. Now I have had occasion
to consider that you need a strong defence and much toil and labour
to be able to make a satisfactory apology for this expression. But
perhaps you have made a partial apology, by saying “I am
generally occupied in thinking how to increase my affliction.”
But I in my turn reckon it as the greatest accusation that you
should say “I take a pride in increasing my sorrow by thinking
over it:” for when you ought to make every possible effort to
dispel your affliction you do the devil’s will, by increasing
your despondency and sorrow. Are you not aware how great an evil
despondency is?</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvii.vi-p12">As to the Isaurians, dismiss your fears in future
concerning them: for they have returned into their own country: and
the governor has done everything necessary in this respect; and I
am in far greater security here than when I was in Cæsarea. For in
future I have no one to fear so much as the bishops, with a few
exceptions. On account of the Isaurians then fear nothing: for they
have retreated, and when winter has set in they are confined to
their own homes, although they may possibly come out after
Whitsuntide. And what do you mean by saying that you have not the
benefit of letters from me? I have already sent you three long
letters, one by the proconsular soldiers, one by Antonius, and the
third by Anatolius my servant; two of them were a salutary medicine
capable of reviving any one who was desponding or stumbling, and
conducting him into a healthy state of serenity. When you have
received these letters then go over them constantly and thoroughly,
and you will perceive their force and enjoy experience of their
healing power, and benefit, and will inform me that you have
derived much advantage therefrom. I have also a third letter ready,
similar to these, which I do not choose to send at the present
<pb n="302" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_302.html" id="xvii.vi-Page_302" />time having been
exceedingly vexed at your saying “I accumulate sorrowful
thoughts, even inventing things which do not exist,” an utterance
unworthy of yourself, which makes me hide my head for shame. But
read those letters which I have sent, and you will no longer say
these things, even if you are infinitely bent on being
despondent.<note place="end" n="955" id="xvii.vi-p12.1"><p class="endnote" id="xvii.vi-p13"> A short passage is omitted here in the translation.
It refers to the transaction of some business between Olympias and
an unknown bishop, Heracleides. The exact meaning is obscure, in
the absence of any clue from historical knowledge of the
incident.</p></note> I at least
have not ceased, and will not cease saying that sin is the only
thing which is really distressing; and that all other things are
but dust and smoke. For what is there grievous in inhabiting a
prison and wearing a chain? or in being ill-treated when it is the
occasion of so much gain? or why should exile be grievous or
confiscation of goods? These are mere words, destitute of any
terrible reality, words void of sorrow. For if you speak of death
you only mention that which is the debt of nature: a thing which
must in any case be undergone even if no one hastens it: and if you
speak of exile you mention that which only involves a change of
country and the sight of many cities: or if you speak of
confiscation of goods you mention what is only freedom and
emancipation from care.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvii.vi-p14">5. Do not cease to pay attention to Maruthas
the Bishop, as far as it concerns you, so as to lift him up out of
the pit.<note place="end" n="956" id="xvii.vi-p14.1"><p class="endnote" id="xvii.vi-p15"> He means, “to detach him from the influence of
the hostile party.” Maruthas was Bishop of Martyropolis in
Persia. He had taken part in one of the synods at Constantinople
which condemned Chrysostom; had returned to Persia, and after doing
good work there had revisited Constantinople, and Chrysostom seems
to have hopes of reclaiming him to his side.</p></note> For I have
special need of him on account of the affairs in Persia. And
ascertain from him, if you can, what has been accomplished there
through his agency, and for what purpose he has come home, and let
me know whether you have delivered the two epistles which I sent to
him: and if he is willing to write to me, I will write again to
him: but if he should not be willing let him at least signify to
your prudence whether any thing more has taken place there, and
whether he is likely to accomplish anything by going thither again.
For on this account I was anxious to have an interview with him.
Nevertheless let all things which depend on you be done, and take
care to fulfill your own part, even if all men are rushing headlong
to ruin. For your reward will thus be perfected. By all means
therefore make friends with him as far as it is possible. I beseech
you not to neglect what I am about to say, but to pay diligent heed
to it. The Marsian and Gothic monks where the Bishop Serapion has
constantly been concealed have informed me that Moduarius the
deacon has come bringing word that Unilas, that excellent bishop
whom I lately ordained and sent into Gothia, has been laid to rest,
after achieving many great exploits: and the deacon was the bearer
of a letter from the king of the Goths begging that a bishop might
be sent to them. Since then I see no other means of meeting the
threatened catastrophe with a view to its correction save delay and
postponement (as it is impossible for them to sail into the
Bosporus or into those parts at the present time), take measures to
put them off for a time on account of the winter season: and do not
by any means neglect this: for it is a matter of the greatest
importance. For there are two things which would specially distress
me if they were to happen, which God forbid: one is that a bishop
should be appointed by these men who have wrought such great
wickedness,<note place="end" n="957" id="xvii.vi-p15.1"><p class="endnote" id="xvii.vi-p16"><i>i.e</i>., the party at Constantinople hostile to
Chrysostom, and the Archbishop Atticus whom they had placed in the
See after the death of Arsacius the first intruder.</p></note> and who have
no right to appoint, and the other is that any one should be made
without consideration. For you know yourself that they are not
anxious to create some worthy man bishop, and if this should take
place, which heaven forbid, you are aware what will follow. Use all
diligence therefore to prevent either of these things happening:
but if it were possible for Moduarius quietly and secretly to
hasten out to me it would be of the greatest advantage. But if this
is not possible let what is practicable under the circumstances be
done. For that which takes place in the case of money, and actually
occurred in the case of the widow in the gospel, also holds good in
the case of practical affairs. For as that poor woman when she had
cast two mites into the treasury surpassed all those who had cast
in more, because she used up her whole substance: even so they who
devote themselves to the work in hand with all their might
discharge it completely, so far as they are concerned, even if
nothing results from it, and they have their reward
perfected.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvii.vi-p17">I am very grateful to Hilarius the bishop: for he
wrote to me asking to be allowed to depart to his own country, and
to set things in order there, and then to come back again. As his
presence therefore is of great service (for he is a devout,
inflexible, and zealous man) I have urged him to depart and to
return speedily. Take care then that the letter is quickly and
safely delivered to him and not cast on one side: for he eagerly
and earnestly begged for letters from me, and his presence is a
great benefit. By all means 
<pb n="303" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_303.html" id="xvii.vi-Page_303" />therefore have a care of the letters; and if
Helladius the presbyter be not on the spot see that they are
delivered to my friends by the hands of some discreet man who has a
head on his shoulders.</p>

<p class="c9" id="xvii.vii-p2"><span class="c12" id="xvii.vii-p2.1">Nothing</span> strange or
unnatural has befallen your Piety, but only what is quite natural
and consonant to reason, that by a constant succession of trials
the sinews of your soul should become more braced, and your zeal
and energy for the struggle increased, and that you should
therefrom derive much joy. For such is the nature of
affliction;—when it lays hold of a brave and noble soul, this is
what it is wont to effect. And as the fire makes the piece of gold,
when it is applied to it, of better proof: so also affliction when
it visits golden characters renders them purer and more proven.
Wherefore also Paul said “affliction worketh patience, and
patience probation.”<note place="end" n="958" id="xvii.vii-p2.2"><p class="endnote" id="xvii.vii-p3"> <scripRef passage="Rom. v. 3, 4" id="xvii.vii-p3.1" parsed="|Rom|5|3|5|4" osisRef="Bible:Rom.5.3-Rom.5.4">Rom. v. 3,

and leap for joy, and derive the greatest consolation of this my
solitude from a consideration of thy fortitude. On this account,
even though innumerable wolves encompass thee, and many crowds of
wicked doers, I fear nothing; but I pray both that existing
temptations may be suppressed, and that others may not occur, thus
fulfilling the Lord’s precept who bids us pray that we may not
enter into temptation; but if it should be permitted to happen
again I have good confidence concerning thy golden soul, which
acquires therefrom the greatest riches for itself. For by what
means will they be able to terrify you, who dare everything to
their own destruction? Will it be by loss of goods? But I know well
that these are counted by thee as dust and cheaper than dirt. Or
shall it be by expulsion from country and home. But you know how to
dwell in great and populous cities as if they were uninhabited,
spending the whole of your time in quietness and rest, and treading
worldly ambitions under foot. Or do they threaten death? This also
you have constantly practiced by anticipation, and if they should
drag you to slaughter, they will be dragging a body which is
already dead. What need to speak more at length? No one will be
able to do anything to thee of this kind which he will not find you
have already abundantly made yourself undergo. For by always
walking in the narrow and strait path, you have trained yourself in
all these things. Wherefore having practised this most beautiful
art in the course of your training, you now shine forth the more
gloriously in the contest itself, not only being in no wise
disturbed by the things which are happening, but rather elated, and
leaping and dancing for joy. For the contests which you have
anticipated in your training you now undertake with much ease,
although it be in a woman’s body, feebler than a cobweb, treading
under foot with derisive scorn the fury of lusty men gnashing their
teeth upon you; being ready to suffer even worse things than they
prepare for you. Happy and thrice happy are you by reason of the
crowns of victory to be won, but even more by reason of the contest
itself. For such is the nature of these struggles, even before the
prizes are given even in the midst of strife they have their
recompense and reward;—the pleasure which you are now enjoying,
the cheerfulness, the courage, the endurance, the patience, the
power which is proof against capture and conquest and rises
superior to all things; the perfect training which renders you
insensible to any terror at the hands of any one, the power of
standing on a rock in the midst of mighty billows of tribulation,
and sailing in a calm with a favourable breeze when the sea is
raging around you. These are the prizes of affliction even in this
world before the kingdom of heaven is won. For I know very well
that, even at this present time, being elated with joy, thou dost
not consider thyself clothed with a body, but if an opportunity
should summon thee to do it, thou wouldst divest thyself of it more
readily than others do of the raiment which they wear. Rejoice
therefore and be glad both for thyself, and for those who have died
a blessed death, not in a bed, nor in a house, but in prison, and
chains, and torment; and bewail those only who do these things, and
grieve for them. But since you also wish to be informed concerning
my bodily health, let me tell you that I have been relieved for the
present from the infirmity which was lately oppressing me, and am
now in a more comfortable condition: the only fear is lest the
winter on its return should again make havoc of my feeble
digestion; and as far as the Isaurians are concerned we now enjoy
great security.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xvii.viii-p1">The following letter is added as a specimen, out of
a very large number, of the natural, almost playful style, and tone
of warm affection, in which Chrysostom wrote to his intimate
friends. All his extant letters were written during his exile, and
therefore there is much repetition in their contents, and great
general similarity of character.</p>

<p class="c32" id="xvii.viii-p2"><pb n="304" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_304.html" id="xvii.viii-Page_304" /><span class="c34" id="xvii.viii-p2.1">to castus, valerius, diophantus, cyriacus</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="xvii.viii-p4"><span class="c12" id="xvii.viii-p4.1">I am</span> not surprised
that you call my long letter a short one. For this is just the way
with lovers; they do not recognize such a thing as satiety, they
will not admit such a thing as satisfaction, but the more they
receive from the objects of their love the more they seek.
Therefore, even if the letter which you have received had been ten
times as large as the former one, it would not have escaped the
epithet of “brief;” in fact it would have been called a small
letter, and not only would it have been so called, but it would
have actually seemed such in your eyes. Hence I also in my turn am
never satisfied with the measure of affection for me which you have
attained, but am always seeking to make additions to your
love-draught, and daily demanding the discharge of your love debt
which is always being paid, and yet is always owing (for it is
written, “owe no man anything but to love one another”<note place="end" n="959" id="xvii.viii-p4.2"><p class="endnote" id="xvii.viii-p5"> <scripRef passage="Rom. xiii. 8" id="xvii.viii-p5.1" parsed="|Rom|13|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.13.8">Rom. xiii.
8</scripRef>.</p></note>). I am
indeed continually receiving what I ask in great abundance, yet
never think that I have received the whole. Do not cease then to
pay down this goodly debt, which has a twofold pleasure. For those
who pay, and those who receive, derive equal enjoyment, inasmuch as
they are both alike enriched by the payment; which in the case of
money is an impossibility, for there the one who pays becomes
poorer, and only the man who has received is richer. But this is
not what commonly happens in the covenant of love. For he who pays
it is not less bereft of it, as in the case of money when it is
transferred to the receiver; but payment of love makes him who pays
richer than before. Knowing these things then, O Sirs, most
honoured and devout, cease not continually displaying this
excellent disposition towards me. For although you need no
exhortation for this purpose from me yet as I greatly long for your
love I remind you, even when you need it not, both in order that
you may constantly write to me, and also inform me of the state of
your health. For even if you do not need any one to remind you on
this account, I shall not desist from continually seeking this at
your hands; as it is a matter which I have very much at heart. That
it is a difficult task owing both to the season of the year, and
the difficulty of the journey, and the scarcity of travellers who
will do this service for you I am well aware: nevertheless as far
as is possible and practicable in the midst of so much difficulty,
we exhort you to write constantly, and crave this favour from your
love.</p>

AND THE CHURCH AT CONSTANTINOPLE, WITH INNOCENT, BISHOP OF
ROME.</span></p>

<p class="c9" id="xviii.ii-p2"><span class="c12" id="xviii.ii-p2.1">Of</span> these four letters the
last three were written during the final exile of St. Chrysostom
from Constantinople. The first was written a few weeks before his
departure. The complication of events which led to that exile
cannot be unfolded here. The student will find a full account of
them in most historians of this period of the Church, both ancient
and modern, and in the Life of St. Chrysostom by the editor of this
volume chapters XVI–XIX. It must suffice to say here that
Theophilus Patriarch of Alexandria having been summoned by an
imperial mandate to Constantinople to be tried on the charge of
having cruelly ill-treated certain Egyptian monks, formed a cabal
amongst the enemies of St. Chrysostom, and artfully contrived to
change his own position from that of the accused into that of the
accuser. His devices were in the end only too successful, and in
the summer of the year 404 St. Chrysostom was driven from his see,
never to return.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xviii.ii-p3">The first letter of St. Chrysostom seems to have
been written soon after Easter 404 and refers to the events
immediately preceding his expulsion.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xviii.ii-p4">The second was written, as we learn from the letter
itself, after he had entered the third year of his exile, probably
near the close of the year 406.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xviii.ii-p5">Copies of the first letter were addressed also to
Venerius Bishop of Milan, and Chromatius Bishop of Aquileia. It is
interesting therefore as indicating the relation between the
Eastern and Western branches of the Church at the beginning of the
fifth century. On the one hand it illustrates the growing tendency
of Christendom to appeal to the authority of the Western Church,
especially of the Bishop of Rome, on questions of ecclesiastical
discipline. The law-making, law-protecting spirit of the West is
invoked to restrain the turbulence and licentiousness of the East.
No jealousy is entertained of the Patriarch of the old Rome by the
Patriarch of the new. But on the other hand it is to be noted that
the Bishop of Rome is in no sense addressed as a supreme
arbitrator: aid and sympathy are solicited from him as from an
elder brother, and two other prelates of Italy are joint recipients
with him of the appeal.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xviii.ii-p6">To Chrysostom Innocent writes, as friend to friend
and bishop to brother bishop, a letter of Christian consolation and
encouragement, not entering into the legal questions of the case,
and not pledging himself to decisive action of any kind. In his
letter to the Church of Constantinople he denounces the illegality
of the late proceedings of Theophilus and his accomplices, in the
strongest terms; but insists upon the necessity of convoking an
œcumenical council as the only means of allaying the tempest. And
it must be allowed that he did his best to accomplish this object.
He wrote a letter to Honorius, the Emperor of the Western Empire,
who resided at Ravenna, describing the pitiable condition of the
Church at Constantinople. The Emperor issued an order for the
convention of an Italian synod, and the synod, swayed no doubt by
Innocent, requested Honorius to write to his brother Arcadius the
Eastern Emperor urging the convention of a general council to be
held <pb n="308" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_308.html" id="xviii.ii-Page_308" />in Thessalonica which
would be a convenient meeting-point for the prelates of East and
West. Honorius complied, and the letter was despatched under the
care of a deputation from the Italian Church, consisting of five
bishops, two priests and a deacon. They were the bearers also of
letters from Innocent, and the Bishops of Milan and Aquileia, and
of a memorial from the Italian synod, recommending that Chrysostom
should be reinstated in his see before he was required to take his
trial before the Council. The party hostile to Chrysostom however
had now such complete sway over the court at Constantinople that
the deputation never succeeded in getting an audience with the
Emperor, and after suffering many insults and indignities, returned
to Italy without having accomplished anything.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xviii.ii-p7">The letters of Innocent were probably written in
Latin, and afterwards translated into Greek. The Greek version is
in several passages clumsy and obscure.</p>

<p class="c38" id="xviii.iii-p4">To my lord, the most reverend and divinely beloved
bishop Innocent, John sends greeting in the Lord.</p>

<p class="c9" id="xviii.iii-p5">1. <span class="c12" id="xviii.iii-p5.1">I suppose</span> that even
before receiving our letter your Piety has heard of the iniquity
which has been perpetrated here. For the magnitude of our distress
has left scarcely a single portion of the world uninformed of this
grievous tragedy: for report carrying the tidings of what has
happened to the very extremities of the earth, has everywhere
caused great mourning and lamentation. But inasmuch as we ought not
to mourn, but to restore order, and to see by what means this most
grievous storm of the Church may be stayed, we have deemed it
necessary to persuade my lords, the most honoured and pious bishops
Demetrius, Pansophius, Pappus and Eugenius to leave their own
churches, and venture on this great sea voyage, and set out on a
long journey from home, and hasten to your Charity, and, after
informing you clearly of everything, to take measures for
redressing the evils as speedily as possible. And with them we have
sent the most honoured and beloved of our Deacons, Paulus and
Cyriacus, but we also ourselves, in the form of a letter, will
briefly instruct your Charity concerning the things which have come
to pass. For Theophilus, who has been entrusted with the presidency
of the Church in Alexandria, having been commanded to repair alone
to Constantinople, certain men having brought an accusation against
him to the most devout Emperor, arrived bringing with him no small
multitude of Egyptian Bishops, as if wishing to show from the
outset, that he came for war and antagonism; moreover when he set
foot in the great and divinely beloved Constantinople he did not
enter the Church according to the custom and the law which has
prevailed from ancient time, he held no intercourse with us, and
admitted us to no share in his conversation, his prayers, or his
society: but as soon as he disembarked, having hurried past the
vestibule of the Church, he departed and lodged somewhere outside
the city, and although we earnestly entreated him, and those who
had come with him, to be our guests (for everything had been made
ready, and lodgings provided, and whatever was suitable) neither
they, nor he consented. We seeing this, were in great perplexity,
not being able to discover the cause of this unjust hostility;
nevertheless we discharged our part, doing what became us, and
continually beseeching him to meet us and to say for what cause he
hazarded so great a contest at the outset, and threw the city into
such confusion. But as he did not choose to state the reason, and
those who accused him were urgent, our most devout Emperor summoned
us and commanded us to go outside the walls to the place where
Theophilus was sojourning, and hear the argument against him. For
they accused him of assault, and slaughter and countless other
crimes; but knowing as we did the laws of the fathers, and paying
respect and deference to the man, and having also his own letters
which prove that lawsuits ought not to be taken beyond the border,
but that affairs of the several provinces should be treated within
the limits of the province, we would not accept the office of
judge, but deprecated it with great earnestness. But he, as if
striving to aggravate the former insults, having summoned my
arch<pb n="310" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_310.html" id="xviii.iii-Page_310" />deacon, by a stretch
of arbitrary power, as if the Church were already widowed, and had
no bishop, by means of this man seduced all the clergy to his own
side; and the Churches became destitute, as the clergy in each were
gradually withdrawn, and instructed to hand in petitions against
us, and trained to prepare accusations. And having done this he
sent and summoned us to trial, although he had not yet cleared
himself of the charges brought against him, a proceeding directly
contrary to the canons and to all the laws.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xviii.iii-p6">2. But we being aware that we were not cited
to a trial (for otherwise we would have presented ourselves any
number of times) but to the presence of an enemy and an adversary,
as was clearly proved by all which occurred both before and after,
despatched certain bishops to him, Demetrius of Pesinus, Eulysius
of Apamea, Lupicinus of Appiaria,<note place="end" n="960" id="xviii.iii-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="xviii.iii-p7"> Pesinus was in Galatia, Apamea in Bithynia,
Appiaria I have not identified.</p></note> and the presbyters Germanus and
Severus, who replied with the moderation which became us, and said,
that we did not decline to be judged, but to appear before an open
enemy, and manifest adversary. For how could one who had not yet
received any bills of indictment against me, and had acted from the
outset in the manner described, and severed himself from the
Church, from communion, and from prayer, and was training accusers,
and seducing the clergy, and desolating the Church, how, I say,
could he with justice mount the throne of the judge which was not
in any sense befitting him? For it is not suitable that one who
belongs to Egypt should act as judge of those who are in Thrace,
and this a man who is himself under an accusation, and an enemy and
adversary. Nevertheless he, in no way abashed, but hurrying on to
the completion of his design, although we had declared our
readiness to clear ourselves of the charges in the presence of a
hundred yea or a thousand bishops, and to prove ourselves innocent
as indeed we are, would not consent: but in our absence, when we
were appealing to a synod, and demanding a trial, and not shrinking
from a hearing of our cause, but only from open enmity, he both
received our accusers and absolved those who had been
excommunicated by me, and from them, who had not yet cleared
themselves of the offences laid to their charge, he received
complaints<note place="end" n="961" id="xviii.iii-p7.1"><p class="endnote" id="xviii.iii-p8"> <i>Libellos</i>, a technical word signifying a
formal petition of complaint or accusation.</p></note> against me,
and had minutes made of the proceedings, all which things are
contrary to law, and the order of the canons. But what need is
there of a long story? He did not cease doing and contriving
everything until, with all possible display of arbitrary power and
authority, he ejected us from the city and the church, when the
evening was far advanced and all the people were streaming after
us. Being drawn by the public informer<note place="end" n="962" id="xviii.iii-p8.1"><p class="endnote" id="xviii.iii-p9"> <i>Curiosus</i>, an official whose duty it was to
investigate charges, and inform the Emperor of offenders.</p></note> through the midst of the city, and
dragged along by force I was taken down to the sea, and thrust on
board ship, and made a night voyage, because I appealed to a synod
for a just hearing of my cause. Who could hear these things without
tears, even if he had a heart of stone?</p>

<p class="c10" id="xviii.iii-p10">But seeing, as I said before, that we ought not
merely to lament the evils which have been done, but also to amend
them, I beseech your Charity to rouse yourself and have compassion,
and do everything so as to put a stop to the mischief at this
point. For even after what I have mentioned he did not desist from
his deeds of iniquity, but sought to renew the former attack. For
when the most devout Emperor had turned out those who shamelessly
rushed into the Church, and many of the Bishops present seeing
their iniquity had retreated into their own dioceses, flying from
the incursion of these men as from a fire devouring all things, we
were again invited to the city, and to the Church, from which we
had been unjustly expelled, more than thirty bishops introducing
us, and our most pious Emperor sending a notary for this purpose,
while Theophilus immediately took to flight. For what purpose, and
from what cause? When we entered the city we besought our most
pious Emperor to convene a synod for prosecuting the offenders in
the late transactions. Being conscious therefore of what he had
done, and dreading conviction, the imperial letters having been
sent in every direction, convoking all men from all quarters,
Theophilus secretly at midnight flung himself into a boat, and so
made his escape, taking all his company with him.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xviii.iii-p11">3. But even then we did not desist, supported as we
were by a clear conscience, from making the same supplication again
to the most devout Emperor: and he, acting as became his piety,
sent to Theophilus again, summoning him from Egypt, and his
associates, in order to give an account of the late proceedings,
and informing him that he was not to suppose that the one-sided
deeds which he had so unjustly perpetrated in our absence, and in
violation of so many canons, would suffice for his defence. He did
not however submit to the royal mandate, but remained at home,
alleging an insurrection of the people in excuse, and the
unseasonable zeal of cer<pb n="311" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_311.html" id="xviii.iii-Page_311" />tain persons who were attached
to him, as he pretended: and yet before the arrival of the imperial
letters this same people had deluged him with abuse. But we do not
make much of these matters now, but have said what we have said as
wishing to prove the fact that he was arrested in his mischievous
course. Yet even after these things we did not rest, but were
urgent in our demand that a tribunal should be formed for the
purpose of enquiry and defence: for we said that we were ready to
prove that we ourselves were guiltless, but that they had
flagrantly transgressed. For there were some Syrians amongst those
present with him at that time, who were left behind here; and we
accosted them expressing our readiness to plead our cause, and
frequently importuned them on this behalf, demanding that the
minutes (of the late transactions) should be given up to us, or
that the formal bills of indictment, or the nature of the charges,
or the accusers themselves, should be made known; and yet we did
not obtain any of these things, but were again expelled from the
Church. How am I to relate the events which followed, transcending
as they do every kind of tragedy? What language will set forth
these events? what kind of ear will receive them without
shuddering? For when we were urging these things, as I said before,
a dense troop of soldiers, on the great Sabbath itself,<note place="end" n="963" id="xviii.iii-p11.1"><p class="endnote" id="xviii.iii-p12"> <i>i. e</i>., Easter Eve.</p></note> as the day
was hastening towards eventide, having broken into the Churches
violently drove out all the clergy who were with us, and surrounded
the sanctuary with arms. And women from the oratories<note place="end" n="964" id="xviii.iii-p12.1"><p class="endnote" id="xviii.iii-p13"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="xviii.iii-p13.1">οἶκοι
ἐυκτήριοι</span>. Churches were sometimes so called, more often,
however, private chapels as distinguished from parish churches. The
meaning here is not very obvious; perhaps some chambers attached to
the Church, where catechumens prayed before baptism, are referred
to.</p></note> who had
stripped themselves for baptism just at that time, fled unclothed,
from terror at this grievous assault, not being permitted to put on
the modest apparel which befits women; indeed many received wounds
before they were expelled, and the baptismal pools were filled with
blood, and the sacred water reddened by it. Nor did the distress
cease even at this point; but the soldiers, some of whom as we
understand were unbaptized, having entered the place where the
sacred vessels were stored, saw all the things which were inside
it, and the most holy blood of Christ, as might happen in the midst
of such confusion, was spilt upon the garments of the soldiers
aforesaid: and every kind of outrage was committed as in a
barbarian siege. And the common people were driven to the
wilderness, and all the people tarried outside the city, and the
Churches became empty in the midst of this great Festival, and more
than forty bishops who associated with us were vainly and
causelessly expelled together with the people and clergy. And there
were shrieks and lamentations, and torrents of tears were shed
everywhere, in the market places, in the houses, in the desert
places, and every part of the city was filled with these
calamities; for owing to the immoderate extent of the outrage not
only the sufferers, but also they who did not undergo anything of
the kind sympathized with us, not only those who held the same
opinions as ours, but also heretics, and Jews, and Greeks, and all
places were in a state of tumult and confusion, and lamentation, as
if the city had been captured by force. And these things were
perpetrated contrary to the intention of our most pious Emperor,
under cover of night, the Bishops contriving them, and in many
places conducting the attack, nor were they ashamed to have
sergeants<note place="end" n="965" id="xviii.iii-p13.2"><p class="endnote" id="xviii.iii-p14"> Campiductores—their special business was to drill
recruits.</p></note> instead of
deacons marching in front of them. And when day dawned all the city
was migrating outside the walls under trees and groves, celebrating
the festival, like scattered sheep.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xviii.iii-p15">4. All which happened afterwards I leave you to
imagine; for as I said before it is not possible to describe each
separate incident. The worst of it is that these evils, great and
serious as they are, have not even now been suppressed nor is there
any hope of their suppression; on the contrary the mischief is
extending itself every day, and we have become a laughing stock to
the multitude, or rather I should say, no one laughs even if he is
infinitely lawless, but all men mourn, as I was saying, this new
kind of lawlessness, the finishing stroke of all our ills.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xviii.iii-p16">What is one to say to the disorders in the other
Churches? For the evil did not stop even here, but made its way to
the east. For as when some evil humor is discharged from the head,
all the other parts are corrupted, so now also these evils, having
originated in this great city as from a fountain, confusion has
spread in every direction, and clergy have everywhere made
insurrection against bishops, there has been schism between bishop
and bishop, people and people, and will be yet more; every place is
suffering from the throes of calamity, and the subversion of the
whole civilized world. Having been informed then of all these
things, my lords, most honourable and devout, exhibit the courage
and zeal which becomes you, so as to put a stop to this great
assault of lawlessness which has been made upon the Churches. For
if this <pb n="312" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_312.html" id="xviii.iii-Page_312" />custom were to prevail,
and it became lawful for any persons who desired it to enter
strange dioceses, so widely separated, and expel those whom one
wished to remove, and do whatever they pleased according to their
own arbitrary power, be assured that all things will go to ruin,
and an implacable kind of war will overrun the whole world, all men
attacking others, and being in turn attacked. Therefore to prevent
such confusion overtaking the whole earth yield to our entreaties
that ye will signify by writing that these lawless transactions
executed in our absence, and after hearing one side only, although
we did not decline a trial, are invalid, as indeed they are by the
very nature of the case, and that those who are convicted of having
committed such iniquities must be subjected to the penalty of the
ecclesiastical laws; and for ourselves, who have not been detected
or convicted, or proved liable to punishment may we continue to
have the benefit of your correspondence, and your love, and all
other things which we have enjoyed aforetime. But if even now those
who have committed such lawless acts are willing to disclose the
charges on the strength of which they have unjustly expelled us,
neither memoranda, nor formal bills of indictment being given, nor
the accusers having appeared: yet if an impartial tribunal is
formed, we will submit to be tried, and will make our defence, and
prove ourselves guiltless of the things laid to our charge, as
indeed we are: for the things which they have done are outside the
bounds of every kind of order, and every kind of ecclesiastical law
and canon. And why do I say ecclesiastical canon? Not even in the
heathen courts would such audacious deeds ever have been committed,
or rather not even in a barbarian court, neither Scythians, nor
Sarmatians would ever have judged a cause in this fashion, deciding
it after hearing one side only, in the absence of the accused, who
only deprecated enmity, not a trial of his case, who was ready to
call any number of judges, asserting himself to be innocent and
able to clear himself of the charges in the face of the world, and
prove himself guiltless in every respect.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xviii.iii-p17">Having considered therefore all these things, and
having been clearly informed of all particulars by my lords, our
most devout brethren the bishops, may you be induced to exert your
zeal on our behalf; for in so doing ye will confer a favour not
upon ourselves alone but also upon the Church at large, and ye will
receive your reward from God who does all things for the peace of
the Churches. Fare thee well always, and pray for me, most honoured
and holy master.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xviii.iv-p2"><span class="c12" id="xviii.iv-p2.1">Our</span> body it is true is
settled in one place, but the pinion of love wings its way round
every part of the world. Even so we also although we be separated
by a journey of such great extent are nigh to your Piety, and in
daily communion with you, beholding with the eyes of love the
courage of your soul, the sterling nature of your disposition, your
firmness and inflexibility, the great consolation, constant and
abiding, which you bestow upon us. For in proportion as the billows
mount higher, and concealed reefs increase, and the hurricanes are
many does your vigilance wax stronger: and neither the great length
of the journey between us, nor the large amount of time consumed,
nor the difficulty in dealing with events has disposed you to
become supine: but ye continue to imitate the best class of pilots
who are on the alert at those times most especially when they see
the waves crested, the sea swelling, the water dashing vehemently,
and the deepest darkness in day-time. Therefore also we feel great
gratitude towards you, and we long to send you showers of letters,
thus affording ourselves the greatest gratification. But since we
are deprived of this, owing to the desolation of the place; (for
not only of those who arrive from your regions, but even of those
who dwell in our part of the world no one could easily have
intercourse with us, both on account of the distance, the spot in
which we are confined being situated at the very extremity of the
country, and also the terror of robbers acting as a bar to the
whole journey:) we beseech you rather to pity us because of our
long silence, than to condemn us for indolence on that account. For
as a proof that our silence has not been due to negligence, we have
now at last after a long time secured our most honoured and beloved
John the presbyter, and Paul the deacon, and we send a letter
through them, and continue to express our gratitude to you, that
you have surpassed even affectionate parents in your good will and
zeal concerning us. And indeed so far as your Piety is concerned
all things would have been duly amended, and the accumulation of
evils and offences have been swept away, and the Churches would
have enjoyed peace and a glassy calm, and all things would have
floated along with a smooth stream, and the despised laws and
violated decrees of the fathers would have been vindicated. But
since in reality none of these things has taken place, they who
perpetrated the former deeds striving to aggravate their <pb n="313" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_313.html" id="xviii.iv-Page_313" />former iniquities, I omit any
detailed narrative of their subsequent proceedings: for the
narrative would exceed the limits not merely of a letter but even
of a history; only this I beseech your vigilant soul, even if they
who have filled everything with confusion be impenitently and
incurably corrupt, let not those who have undertaken to cure them
become faint-hearted or despondent, when they consider the
magnitude of the thing to be accomplished. For the contest now
before you has to be fought on behalf of nearly the whole world, on
behalf of Churches humbled to the ground, of people dispersed, of
clergy assaulted, of bishops sent into exile, of ancestral laws
violated. Wherefore we beseech your Diligence, once, twice, yea
many times, in proportion as the storm increases, to manifest still
greater zeal. For we expect that something more will be done for
the purpose of amending these wrongs. But even if this should not
take place, ye at least have your crown made ready for you by the
merciful God, and the resistance offered by your love will be no
small consolation to those who are wronged: for now that we are
passing the third year of our sojourn in exile exposed to famine,
pestilence, wars, continual sieges, indescribable solitude, daily
death, and Isaurian swords, we are not a little encouraged and
comforted by the constant and abiding nature of your disposition
and confidence, and by revelling in your abundant and genuine love.
This is our wall of defence, this is our security, this our calm
haven, this our treasure of infinite blessings, this our gladness,
and ground of much joy. And even if we should be carried off again
to some spot more desolate than this, we shall carry this love away
with us as no small consolation of our sufferings.</p>

conscience has in retaining hope. For thou who art the teacher and
pastor of so many people needest not to be taught that the best men
are ever frequently put to the test whether they will persevere in
the perfection of patience, and not succumb to any toil of
distress: and certainly conscience is a strong defence against all
things which unjustly befall us: and unless any one conquer these
by patient endurance he supplies an argument for evil surmising.
For he ought to endure all things who trusts first of all in God,
and then in his own conscience; seeing that the noble and good man
can be specially trained to endurance, inasmuch as the holy
Scriptures guard his mind; and the sacred lessons which we deliver
to the people abound in examples, testifying as they do that nearly
all the saints have been continually oppressed in divers ways, and
are tested as by a kind of scrutiny, and so attain to the crown of
patience. Let conscience itself console thy love, most honoured

For under the eye of the Master Christ, the conscience, having been

<p class="c10" id="xviii.vi-p2"><span class="c12" id="xviii.vi-p2.1">From</span> the letters of your
love which ye have sent by the hands of Germanus the presbyter, and
Casianus the deacon, I have studied with anxious care the scene of
calamity which ye have placed before my eyes, and by repeated
perusal of your description I thoroughly perceived under what great
distress and toil your faith is labouring: and this is a matter
which can be cured only by the consolation of patience: for our God
will speedily grant an end to such great afflictions, and He will
aid you in your endurance of these things. Moreover whilst praising
the statement of your case which contains many testimonies
encouraging to patience I notice this necessary consolation placed
at the beginning of the epistle of your love: for the consolation
which we ought to have written to you, ye have anticipated by your
letter. For this is the kind of patience which our Master is wont
to supply to those who are in distress, in order that the servants
of Christ when they are in affliction may console themselves by
reflecting that the things which they themselves are suffering have
happened to the saints also in former times. And we also from your
letter shall be able to derive consolation: for we are not
estranged from sympathy with you, inasmuch as we also are chastised
in your persons. For who will be able to endure the offences
committed by those men who ought to be specially zealous promoters
of the tranquillity of the Church and of concord itself. At the
present time, by a perversion of custom, guiltless priests are
expelled from the presidency of their own 
<pb n="314" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_314.html" id="xviii.vi-Page_314" />Churches. And this is what your chief
brother, and fellow minister, John, your bishop has unjustly
suffered, not having obtained any hearing: no crime is charged
against him, none is heard. And what is the object of this
iniquitous device? that no pretext for a trial may occur, or be
sought, other men are introduced into the places of living priests,
as if those who start from an offence of this description could be
judged by any one to have anything good or to have done anything
right.<note place="end" n="966" id="xviii.vi-p2.2"><p class="endnote" id="xviii.vi-p3"> I have followed the Latin here. The Greek version
of the passage seems to me hopelessly confused.</p></note> For we
understand that such deeds have never been perpetrated by our
fathers; or rather that they were prevented by the fact that no one
had authority given him to ordain another to take the place of one
who was still living. For a spurious ordination cannot deprive the
priest of his rank: seeing that neither can he be a bishop who is
wrongfully substituted for another. And as regards the observance
of the canons we lay it down that we ought to follow those, which
were defined at Nicæa, to which alone the Catholic Church is bound
to pay obedience and recognition. And if others are brought forward
by certain men, which are at variance with the canons framed at
Nicæa, and are proved to have been composed by heretics, let them
be rejected by the Catholic bishops. For the inventions of heretics
ought not to be appended to the Catholic canons; for by their
adverse and unlawful decrees they are always intending to weaken
the design of the canons of Nicæa. Not only therefore do we say
that these ought not to be followed, but rather that they should be
condemned amongst heretical and schismatic decrees, as was formerly
done in the Council of Sardica by the bishops who were before us.<note place="end" n="967" id="xviii.vi-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="xviii.vi-p4"> The Council of Sardica was convened A.D. 343, (or
A.D. 344?) with a view of settling the Arian controversy. The
Oriental bishops, however, of whom the majority belonged to the
Arian faction, seceded from Sardica, and held a separate council at
Philippopolis, where they drew up a creed which was condemned by
the Western bishops as heretical.</p></note> For it were
more fitting, most honoured brethren, that good deeds should be
condemned than that things done in direct opposition to the canons
should have any validity. But what are we to do against such things
at the present time? A synodical decision of them is necessary, and
we have long declared that a synod ought to be convened, as it is
the only means of allaying the agitation of such tempests as these:
and if we obtain this it is expedient that the healing of these
evils should be committed to the will of the great God, and His
Christ our Lord. All the disturbances then which have been caused
by the envy of the devil for the probation of the faithful will be
mitigated; through the firmness of our faith we ought not to
despair of anything from the Lord. For we ourselves also are
considering much by what means the œcumenical synod may be brought
together in order that by the will of God these disturbing
movements may be brought to an end. Let us therefore endure for a
while, and fortified by the wall of patience let us hope that all
things may be restored to us by the assistance of our God. Moreover
all things which ye say ye have undergone we have learned by
accurate enquiry from our fellow bishops who have already taken
refuge in Rome, although for the most part at different times, that
is to say, Demetrius, Cyriacus, Eulysius and Palladius, who are
here with us.</p>

<p class="c9" id="xix.ii-p2">1. <span class="c12" id="xix.ii-p2.1">Among</span> the events
which occurred in the time of John Chrysostom,<note place="end" n="968" id="xix.ii-p2.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.ii-p3"> [That is events which occurred at <i>
Antioch</i> during St. Chrysostom’s sojourn in that city—<span class="c12" id="xix.ii-p3.1">Ed</span>.]</p></note> there is none more memorable than
that sedition of the inhabitants of Antioch, in which the Statues
of the Emperor Theodosius and Flacilla his wife were thrown down
and dragged about the city, at which Theodosius was so exasperated,
as even to think of destroying the city entirely. This afforded
ample matter for our Chrysostom to exercise his powers of
preaching. For as the people of Antioch were fluctuating between
hope and fear (sudden accidents offering of course daily some fresh
cause for hope or alarm) Chrysostom, compelled as he was to adapt
his style to circumstances as they arose, almost always without
preparation, delivered on the spur of the occasion these Homilies,
which are certainly well deserving of admiration. At one time his
object here is to console a people struggling with present
distress; at another, to strengthen minds that were sinking under
the extremity of danger; and above all, by repeated admonition, to
persuade the people of Antioch, on occasion of the threatened
calamities, to correct the vices and to wipe away the crimes that
had thus provoked God’s wrath; which endeavour on the part of
Chrysostom certainly ended in results agreeable to his desire, as
he sometimes acknowledges.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.ii-p4">2. But the cause of this great sedition was,
according to the testimony of Zosimus, excess of taxation, which
was daily inventing new imposts; an exaction required either for
the celebration of the fifth year upon which Arcadius had entered,
from the time he was proclaimed under the title of Augustus, and
the tenth year of the Emperor Theodosius, commencing in the year
388, or for the expenses of the war against the tyrant Maximus,<note place="end" n="969" id="xix.ii-p4.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.ii-p5"> [And the Goths who were threatening the
Danubian frontier.—<span class="c12" id="xix.ii-p5.1">Ed</span>.]</p></note> or on
account of both these events, as well as for other necessities of
the state. The people of Antioch, that is to say, the superior
class of the citizens, dismayed at the burden of this impost, first
approached the prefect, and with tears lamented the excess of the
tax that had been announced, and implored the Divine assistance.
And next, a multitude of vagabonds and foreigners of the lowest
class of the people,<note place="end" n="970" id="xix.ii-p5.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.ii-p6"> [These low foreign adventurers were sometimes
hired by actors to get up applause in the theatre, or by men of
rank, not overpopular, to raise a cheer when they appeared in
public.—<span class="c12" id="xix.ii-p6.1">Ed</span>.]</p></note> in a state of excited feeling,
broke out into deeds of violence. At first they turned every thing
upside down in the public baths; hence they proceeded to the
prefect’s palace, and attacked the doors and windows, and were
scarcely repelled, when they turned their rage in another
direction, and attacked the painted tablets of the Emperors with
stones, covered them with filth, and reduced them to a ruinous
condition, while they loaded the Augusti themselves with curses and
reproaches. At length they threw down the Statues of the Emperor
Theodosius and Flacilla his deceased wife,<note place="end" n="971" id="xix.ii-p6.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.ii-p7"> See Hom. XXI., where St. Chrysostom speaks of him
as especially pained at this.</p></note> and dragged them through the
streets of the city; and had already commenced further outrages,
when they were put down by a band of archers, dispatched from the
prefect. The sedition being thus extinguished, fear took the place
of madness, and the expectation of impending punishment caused the
burdensome tax that had been imposed to 
<pb n="318" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_318.html" id="xix.ii-Page_318" />be entirely forgotten. What followed afterwards
will be narrated below in the review of the Homilies. Something
must now be said as to the year of the sedition, in which these
Homilies were delivered.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.ii-p8">3. Dismissing the narrative of Sozomen and
Theodoret, according to whose account, this sedition, and the
delivery of these discourses, must have been after the war against
Maximus, learned men, and Tillemont especially (at length in note
27 appended to his Life of the Emperor Theodosius) have proved from
far more certain notes of time, that these events took place before
the war against Maximus. In opposition to that former opinion, he
produces a most convincing argument from Chrysostom’s own words,
who in the sixteenth Homily (No. 2.), testifies that this was the
second year since he had begun to preach; but he began when he was
first ordained presbyter at the end of the year 385, or at the
beginning of 386. Wherefore these discourses ought to be attributed
either to the year 388, or rather 387. For the former opinion
Baronius contends, and after him, Petavius and Henry Valesius, who
assign them to the year 388, for this reason, that the tenth year
of the reign of Theodosius then commenced, for the celebration of
which the tax before mentioned was imposed. But what is adduced
from Libanius for the defence of this opinion is full of
perplexity,<note place="end" n="972" id="xix.ii-p8.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.ii-p9"> <i>i. e.</i>, so far as the inference is concerned.
His testimony is explicit to the fact that the tax was levied for
that purpose, and he was on the spot.</p></note> and is
capable of being twisted to support either opinion. A still more
certain indication than any of these is gathered from the
circumstance, that the Emperor Theodosius was certainly at
Constantinople during the winter and Lent of the year 387, in which
year also the sedition must necessarily have occurred; for at the
time of the sedition he was most certainly staying at
Constantinople,<note place="end" n="973" id="xix.ii-p9.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.ii-p10"> See the opening of the oration of Libanius,
written <i>as if</i> to be delivered by him there, and Hom. XVII.
6, and Hom. XXI. (2).</p></note> but on the
other hand at the same season in the year immediately following, he
was living at Thessalonica. But what is alleged to the contrary
from the celebration of the tenth year of Theodosius, which
commenced in the year 388, amounts, as I said, to nothing; since it
is evident from the Fasti of Idatius and of Marcellinus, that he
anticipated by one year the celebration of the tenth year of his
reign, in order that he might celebrate his tenth together with his
son Arcadius, who entered upon the fifth year of his reign in 387;
just in the same manner as Maximianus Herculius did, when he
celebrated the twentieth, though it was only the eighteenth, year
of his reign, along with Diocletion, whose twentieth year of empire
it was.<note place="end" n="974" id="xix.ii-p10.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.ii-p11"> [See also <i>Life of St. John Chrysostom</i>,
chapter xi. by Stephens, where the sedition at Antioch is
described, and a summary of the Homilies on the Statues is
given.—<span class="c12" id="xix.ii-p11.1">Ed</span>.]</p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.ii-p12">4. But another and not a less difficulty
arises, which has been already treated of in the Preface to the
work, “Against the Jews;” viz. that in a certain discourse
against the Jews, held in the month of September of the year 386,
Chrysostom in reproving many of the Christians at Antioch who
fasted and kept Easter<note place="end" n="975" id="xix.ii-p12.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.ii-p13"> Pascha is either Passover or Easter. St.
Thos. Aquinas, in the Hymn <i>Lauda Sion</i>, appropriates it to
the Christian Festival, calling the Jewish <i>Phase
vetus</i>.</p></note> with the Jews, or at the same time
observed by the Jews, “Behold,” saith he, “the first day of
unleavened bread in this year falls on Sunday, and it is necessary
that we should fast throughout the whole week, and after the
Passion is past, and the Cross and the Resurrection arrived,<note place="end" n="976" id="xix.ii-p13.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.ii-p14"> <i>i. e</i>., the actual days of them on the
Jewish computation. This appears the true answer to the difficulty.
The Jews kept the Passover this year <i>earlier</i> than the
Christians: viz. on the 14th day of the moon, or April 18.
See <i><span lang="FR" id="xix.ii-p14.1">l’Art de Verifier les
Dates</span></i> on the year. Thus the supposed difficulty
becomes a confirmation of the date otherwise determined. Montfaucon
understood it, “we must…if we follow the Judaizers.”
Tillemont is at a loss to explain the title of Homily III. against
the Jews. <i>Against those who would fast the first Passover</i>.
It may mean either the <i>original</i>, or that which then happened
to be the earlier. The word <i>fast</i> is explained by taking it
as their expression for <i>keep</i>. He thinks it necessary to tell
them that the true Passover is not <i>fasting</i>, but the <i>Holy
Communion</i>. Ben. t. i. p. 611, b. And this agrees with what he
says is the common case, viz. that the Christian Easter is so much
later, as is required to complete the week.</p></note> we should
continue fasting; and very often the same thing occurs, that after
the Passion has passed away, and the Cross and the Resurrection
arrived, we are still keeping the fast, the week being not yet
finished.” From these words it is further evident, that those
Christians, who acted as Jews in keeping 
<pb n="319" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_319.html" id="xix.ii-Page_319" />the fast and celebrating the Passover, must
sometimes have fasted when other Christians were celebrating the
Paschal feast, and at other times not so; for example, they fasted
on the day of the Resurrection when the Jews celebrated the feast
of the Passover later than the rest of the Christians did, but they
did not fast when the Jews celebrated the same feast earlier than
the Christians. But in the discourse of Chrysostom above mentioned,
and held about the month of September of the year 386, he is
doubtless treating of Lent and Easter of the year 387. But in that
year, according to the Paschal tables, the feast fell on the 25th
of April, that is to say, as late as it can possibly occur. How
then could these judaizing Christians be fasting this year during
the Paschal feast, and celebrate that feast too late, when this
could not occur later than on the 25th of April, on which day the
other nonjudaizing Christians celebrated it this year, at least if
the Paschal tables are to be relied upon? This is certainly a very
great difficulty; but one which, as Tillemont himself confesses, is
not sufficient to overturn the marks of the period by which we
assign the Homily, “Against the Jews,” to the month of
September, in the year 386. For as we have said in the Preface to
the Homilies against the Jews, it has not yet been made out to us
so certainly, whether the people of Antioch always followed by an
invariable rule the Alexandrian reckoning as to the Feast of the
Lord’s Passover, and if they had always followed it, can we
affirm that they never fell into error in their reckoning?
Certainly the persons best skilled in the Paschal reckonings, whom
I have consulted, have admitted that an error of this sort
sometimes does happen in such reckonings, and did happen not many
years since; and that it is not always safe to prefer the Paschal
indications to any other notes of time.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.ii-p15">5. Tillemont, however, who notices this kind
of difficulty, and discusses it in his notes to the Life of
Chrysostom, where he treats of the Homilies against the Jews, has
not mentioned it in the notes to the Life of the Emperor
Theodosius, where he arranges these Homilies of Chrysostom to the
people of Antioch as if the Feast of Easter had fallen on the 25th
of April, as the Paschal tables have it. The first Homily therefore
he places a little before the sedition; but the sedition on the
26th of February, ten days before Lent, which at Antioch began on
the Monday of our Quinquagesima, falling that year on the 8th of
March. The second Homily either on the Thursday, or the Saturday
before Lent; viz. on the 6th of March, the eighth day after the
sedition. The third on the following Sunday, the 7th of March, or
thereabout. The fourth, on the Monday following, March 8. The
fifth, on Tuesday, March 9. The sixth, about the next Wednesday, on
March 10. The seventh, on Thursday, March 11. The eighth, on
Friday, March 12. The ninth on the Monday of the second week in
Lent, March 15. The tenth, after the lapse of a few days. The
eleventh, (considering it transposed,) on the Monday of the fourth
week in Lent, March 29. The twelfth, on the following Tuesday,
March 30. The thirteenth, on the following Wednesday, March 31. The
fourteenth, a little after that one which is numbered the
eighteenth, which was delivered on the fifth Sunday in Lent, April
5. The fifteenth, on the Saturday of the second week in Lent, or
March 20. The sixteenth, on the third Saturday in Lent, March 21.
The seventeenth, about the end of the fourth week in Lent. The
eighteenth, Sunday, April 5, or thereabout. The nineteenth, after
the fourteenth, about April 11. The twentieth, on Easter Day, April
25. The twenty-first, about the same time as the twenty-second
following it, which was delivered on the Friday after Passion
Sunday, April 16.<note place="end" n="977" id="xix.ii-p15.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.ii-p16"> The second before Easter. It has lately become
common to call the week immediately before Easter “Passion
Week,” but this name belongs to the week before it. The proper
title of the last is the “Great” or “Holy” Week.</p></note> Thus does
Tillemont endeavour to restore with the utmost accuracy the
deranged order of these Homilies. Whilst however we agree with him
in many things, we are compelled to differ from him in others. The
order of the Homilies, as he lays it down, we may here further
represent in one tabular view.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.ii-p39">But before we discourse singly of the
Homilies, and make a few observations as to the order as well as
the argument of each, it may be worth while to remark, that from
the title of the Homily which formerly was numbered the
twenty-second, but not the twentieth, which title it has in the
notes of Fronton, and in our <span class="c12" id="xix.ii-p39.1">mss.</span>; it must
have been spoken ten days before Easter; and that from these words
likewise, just before the end of the Homily, “Forty days have
already passed away,” Tillemont justly infers, that Lent among
the people of Antioch began on the Monday after Quinquagesima; and
that among them the whole Lent extended through seven weeks; and he
rightly assigns this Homily to a Friday during Lent;<note place="end" n="978" id="xix.ii-p39.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.ii-p40"> “<i>Feriam sextam Quadragesima</i>.” This
looks like a reprint, as he is more definite.</p></note> so that that
day was both the fortieth from the beginning of the fast, and the
tenth before Easter. Hence we hold it as a thing established, that
Lent, which in divers Churches was defined by various limits, was
observed at Antioch during seven<note place="end" n="979" id="xix.ii-p40.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.ii-p41"> As now in the Greek church. The Latins do not count
the week in which Ash-Wednesday is, as not being a whole one.</p></note> weeks.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.ii-p42">Moreover, since for the causes before related,
we may account the diurnal Paschal tables, which place the Easter
of the year 387 upon the 25th of April, as of doubtful authority,<note place="end" n="980" id="xix.ii-p42.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.ii-p43"> It has been shewn, in a former note, that there is
no reason for this doubt.</p></note> at least
those for the use of the Church at Antioch; we have not discovered
with certainty on what day the people of Antioch kept Easter in
this year 387, we shall abstain from mentioning the day of the
month in the review of the Homilies, and we shall account it
sufficient to have indicated, when that may be safely done, on what
day of the week the Homilies were spoken.</p>

<p id="xix.ii-p44">The first Homily, then, was delivered a few days before
the sedition at Antioch, as is discoverable from these words in No.
(3) of the second Homily; “I lately protracted a long discourse
to your charity and I have received<note place="end" n="981" id="xix.ii-p44.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.ii-p45"> “<i>accepi,</i>” it should be, as in
Text, <i>“exegi,”</i> “I demanded.”</p></note> reward for my labours. But what was
the reward? To punish the blasphemers in the city, and to chastise
those who treat God with contempt, and to restrain the violent.”
Without doubt these words have reference to the first Homily, one
of great length, on the subject of the sorrows of the Saints, and
the providence of God towards His Elect, who are tormented in this
life, where <pb n="321" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_321.html" id="xix.ii-Page_321" />at last he
thus expresses himself in a manner certainly worthy of observation.
“But since our discourse has now turned to the subject of
blasphemy, I desire to ask one favour of you all in return for this
address and speaking with you, which is, that you will correct on
my behalf those who blaspheme in this city. And should you hear any
one in the public thoroughfare, or in the midst of the forum,
blaspheming God; go up to him, rebuke him; and should it be
necessary to inflict blows, spare not to do so. Smite him on the
face; strike his mouth; sanctify thy hand with the blow.” Which
truly would be a mode of correction not suited to modern usage.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.ii-p46">The second Homily, Tillemont refers either to the
Thursday or to the Saturday before Lent; but it may more safely be
pronounced to have been spoken “about” that time, seven days
having been completed as Chrysostom himself says, since the
sedition, during which he declares that he had been silent, because
the people of Antioch, being in consternation from the mighty
calamity and from the immensity of the danger, were in no fit state
for the hearing of Sermons; moreover, that this evil was one sent
from God, on account of their having neglected the correction of
their blaspheming brethren; and after he has drawn a beautiful
picture of their state, he concludes the discourse, after having
preached at length on riches, the use of riches, alms-giving, and
poverty.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.ii-p47">The third Homily follows close on the second. But we
suppose with Tillemont, that it was delivered on Quinquagesima
Sunday (to speak according to modern custom). Chrysostom treats
here of the departure of Flavian the Bishop of Antioch to
Constantinople for the purpose of appeasing the Emperor, and
consoles the people with the hope of his succeeding. He then proves
at length that there is no utility in fasting, unless there be an
abstinence from vices. But after making a few remarks on avoiding
slander, he deplores the present calamity, and relates some harsh
severities. “Some,” saith he, “have perished by the sword,
some by fire; some given to wild beasts; and not men only but
children. And neither this immaturity of age, nor the tumult of the
people, nor the circumstance that they were infuriated by demons
when they perpetrated such deeds, nor that the exaction was thought
to be intolerable, nor poverty, nor having offended in company with
all, nor promising that they would never hereafter dare to repeat
such deeds, nor any thing else could at all rescue them; but they
were led away to the pit without reprieve, armed soldiers
conducting and guarding them on either side, lest any one should
carry off the criminals; whilst mothers also followed afar off,
seeing their children beheaded, but not daring to bewail their
calamity; for terror conquered grief, and fear overcame
nature.”</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.ii-p48">All these evils were inflicted on the people of
Antioch by the Prefects or Magistrates before Theodosius had heard
any thing of the sedition, as Chrysostom says in the same place.
But he concludes the address by admonishing that they should
abstain from slander, from enmities, and from oaths.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.ii-p49">The fourth Homily, delivered as it seems on the
Monday, which was the beginning of Lent, describes the advantages
gained from the calamity. He speaks of the people of Antioch as
changed and brought back from their former habits. But at the close
he again repeats the same admonition, which he reminds them that he
had given in the foregoing Homily, that is to say, concerning
slanders, enmities, and oaths. But in No. (6.), he says, that he
should speak throughout this week concerning oaths.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.ii-p50">The fifth Homily was pronounced on the day
following, that is, on the Tuesday, as Chrysostom says at the
beginning of it. In this Chrysostom consoles the people of Antioch
as usual, under their sadness, and exhorts them to a contempt for
death. In the end also he treats No. (7.) of the avoidance of
oaths, and indicates somewhat of the order of the foregoing and
following Homilies in these words. “Let us therefore persuade it
(our soul) to make this first change for the better by the
avoidance of oaths; for although I spake to 
<pb n="322" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_322.html" id="xix.ii-Page_322" />you yesterday and the day before<note place="end" n="982" id="xix.ii-p50.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.ii-p51"> Lat. has only “the day before yesterday.”</p></note> on this same
subject, yet neither to-day, nor to-morrow, nor the day after, will
I desist from giving my counsel on this subject.”</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.ii-p52">In the sixth Homily, delivered on the Wednesday of
the first week, he imparts consolation to the afflicted, and urges
them to hope for a prosperous turn of affairs. He speaks of the
delays the messengers had met with, who were gone to announce to
the Emperor the sedition at Antioch, as proceeding from God; and
from thence deduces a favourable hope for his hearers, and bids
them feel confidence of obtaining pardon by the petition of Flavian
the Bishop; and after he had discoursed on the subject of not being
afraid of death, he again speaks as usual against oaths.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.ii-p53">The seventh Homily was delivered, as is
evident from many indications, on the day following. “It is the
fifth day,” says Chrysostom, “we are engaged in speaking words
of comfort to your charity.” But this fifth day is reckoned by
beginning from the Sunday, so that he must be speaking of the fifth
day of the week. He here treats of the first words of Genesis,
“In the beginning God made heaven and earth;” and he observes,
that God is not only good when He chastises, but also when He
confers favours;<note place="end" n="983" id="xix.ii-p53.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.ii-p54"> This must be a slip of the pen. [The
sentences have clearly got transposed, and we should read “not
only good when He confers favours, but also when He
chastises.”—<span class="c12" id="xix.ii-p54.1">Ed</span>.]</p></note> and
concludes by exhorting to avoid oaths.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.ii-p55">The eighth Homily Tillemont supposes to have been
spoken on the day following the seventh Homily, that is, on the
Friday. But Chrysostom disclaims it, who testifies at the outset
that he discoursed on the passage, “In the beginning God made
heaven and earth, lately” (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="xix.ii-p55.1">πρῴην</span>) not yesterday (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="xix.ii-p55.2">χθšς</span>), which without doubt belongs to the
seventh Homily. Therefore the present Homily is to be assigned to
the Saturday;<note place="end" n="984" id="xix.ii-p55.3"><p class="endnote" id="xix.ii-p56"> Both arguments may stand, as the common use of
πρῴην is undoubted.</p></note> which these
words just immediately after the beginning would also incline us to
think. “The week hath nearly arrived at its close with us.” The
argument of the Homily he draws from these words, “God was
walking in Paradise in the cool of the day.” On this he observes
the wicked are always timid and fearful, but the godly full of
confidence. Finally, he treats according to his custom of the
avoiding of oaths, and says, that it is now the sixth day since he
had been admonishing as to the observance of this law.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.ii-p57">The ninth Homily Tillemont with probability
allots to the Monday of the second week in Lent. But as to this
matter no indication presents itself by which we may lay down any
thing certain or probable. This discourse was, however, delivered
after a silence of one or more days, as Chrysostom expressly
states<note place="end" n="985" id="xix.ii-p57.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.ii-p58"> By using the word 
πρῷην. But this may be in anticipation of his
reference to Hom. VII. But if this Homily were delivered on Monday,
the first day of <i>strict</i> fasting, the scruples of the
congregation would be accounted for. No difficulty remains but the
use of πρῷην, in Hom. X., against
which is ἐπιοῦσαν. Placing the trials, and Hom.
XI.–XVIII. a week later throughout, seems less consistent.</p></note> at the
beginning; contrary to which is the opinion of Tillemont, who,
whilst he allots the eighth Homily to the Friday of one week, and
the ninth to the Monday of the week following, says in the Life of
Chrysostom, Art. (15.), that the intervening Sabbaths and Lord’s
days were doubtless distinguished by discourses of Chrysostom,
which discourses have been lost. Chrysostom, at the commencement of
this, praises the people of Antioch, that yielding to his
admonitions they were taking pains to expel the practice of oaths.
On these words also, “The heavens declare the glory of God,” he
speaks at length, and sets forth God’s providence in the order
and harmony of the natural world, and at length he concludes the
address by admonishing that oaths should be abstained
from.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.ii-p59">The tenth Homily was not delivered on the day
following the ninth, although it follows up the same argument, as
is shewn by the word, <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="xix.ii-p59.1">πρῴην</span>
“lately.” But Chrysostom here congratulates his auditors that
they had yielded to his admonitions. He declares it is far better
to hear the word of God than to fast. He then proves that the world
could not pos<pb n="323" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_323.html" id="xix.ii-Page_323" />sibly subsist
without a divine Providence, and he ends, at length, by an
exhortation to abstain from oaths.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.ii-p60">The eleventh Homily, Tillemont supposes to
have been delivered after that which here has the inscription of
the fifteenth, as well as after the sixteenth which follows it. The
argument he employs is this; In this Homily he says, the subject is
concerning certain dangers and distresses which the city of Antioch
had already passed through, which events seem to have taken place
after the arrival of Hellebichus and Cæsarius. But that arrival of
Hellebichus and Cæsarius is mentioned in the Title of the
seventeenth Homily,<note place="end" n="986" id="xix.ii-p60.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.ii-p61"> See note at the beginning of that Homily and the
preceding; it is almost certain from the whole character of Hom.
XVII. that it was not delivered immediately after the events
referred to. Probably many had returned, who St. Chrysostom wished
to inform of the events during their absence.</p></note> long after the eleventh of which we
are now treating.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.ii-p62">Supported by this argument, Tillemont thinks that
not only the fifteenth, but also the sixteenth ought to be placed
before the eleventh. But besides that all the Manuscripts, without
exception, preserve the very same order as the published Editions,
we have not a sufficiently accurate knowledge of all the events,
the dangers, terrors, and threats of the time, that for a reason of
this sort we should deem there ought to be any change in the order.
Chrysostom has spoken of many things, but was perhaps silent on
many more. Wherefore, until something more certain be brought to
light, we think the ancient order must be adhered to. In this
Homily Chrysostom at the beginning gives thanks, because the city
breathed again after the terror that had fallen on it, since
multitudes had taken flight in consequence of suspicions that had
been thrown out among them. For some days Chrysostom was silent (as
he himself says) during this season of calamity and terror. But
Tillemont assigns this Homily to the Monday of the fourth week in
Lent, and indeed with the best reason, as we shall shew when we
come to the thirteenth Homily. In the present Homily he treats
principally of the wisdom of God in the constitution of man, and at
the end concerning the avoiding of oaths.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.ii-p63">The twelfth, as well as the thirteenth, for the same
reason as above, Tillemont makes later than the fifteenth and
sixteenth. But I know not in what way he understands that passage
in this twelfth Homily, No. (2.) “On the three foregoing days,
then, we have investigated one method of acquiring the knowledge of
God, and have brought it to a conclusion, explaining how ‘the’
visible ‘heavens declare the glory of God,’ and what is the
meaning of that which is said by Paul; ‘The invisible things of
Him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being
understood by the things that are made;’ and we have shewed how
from the creation of the world, and how by heaven, and earth, and
sea, the Creator is glorified. But to-day,” etc. Here Chrysostom
clearly refers to a series of these Homilies in the order in which
they were delivered before the twelfth, that is to say, the ninth,
the tenth, and the eleventh. In the ninth (No. 2.) he places as the
argument of his discourse the saying of Paul, “The invisible
things of Him,” etc. as well as that of the Psalms, “The
heavens declare the glory of God.” In the tenth (No. 2.) likewise
he declares that he is pursuing this very argument. In the eleventh
(No. 2.) also he testifies that he is insisting on the same
argument. Is not Tillemont doing violence to the words of
Chrysostom, when he wishes the tenth and the eleventh to be
inserted between the fifteenth and sixteenth? This, however, he
only proposes, half doubtingly, in note (29) on the Emperor
Theodosius, No. 10, 11 seqq. and he confesses, that the order which
we have laid down is clearly indicated by Chrysostom; but for what
reason I know not, he afterwards departs from the same order. But
when Chrysostom says, “on the three past days,” it is not to be
understood of three successive days, but of the three last days on
which he had preached. In this twelfth Homily, likewise, which was
delivered on the Tuesday of the fourth week, he dwells on the same
subject of the wisdom of God in the creation of the <pb n="324" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_324.html" id="xix.ii-Page_324" />world. He afterwards treats of the
natural law, the knowledge of which God hath implanted in man, and
on the avoidance of oaths.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.ii-p64">The thirteenth Homily was spoken the day after the
twelfth. At the commencement he returns thanks to God that the face
of affairs was changed, and the fear removed, which had been such
that “the greater part of the city,” as he says, “had taken
refuge from the fear and danger of that occasion in secret places,
in deserts, and hollows.” Hence he proceeds to speak of many who
were dragged to the tribunal; of the horrible inquisition that took
place by means of the scourge; of others who were hurried away to
punishment; of a mother and sister of a certain person, who, whilst
he was undergoing his trial within, were rolling in the dust at the
vestibule. Chrysostom describes pathetically these events which had
been transacted a few days before, that is to say, before he
delivered the eleventh discourse. But the words which Chrysostom
uses in the beginning, <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="xix.ii-p64.1">οἵαν τὴν
παρελθοῢσαν εἴδομεν τετρ€δα καὶ οἵαν τὴν παροῢσαν ὁρωμεν
νῢν</span>, Bernard Brixianus
thus renders, “Quale præteritum vidimus quatriduum et quale nunc
videmus præsens:” I know not for what reason we have left this
untouched. For although <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="xix.ii-p64.2">τετρὰς</span>
is sometimes taken to signify the fourth day, yet in ecclesiastical
language, even from the time of Clemens Alexandrinus, <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="xix.ii-p64.3">τετρὰς</span> is the fourth day of the
week, so that the Translation should be corrected, and should
stand, “Qualem feriam quartam præteritam vidimus,” etc. In
which it is declared, that the Homily was delivered on the fourth
day of the week, and that indeed the fourth week in Lent, or
perhaps the third, according to another mode of reckoning; since
for many ages downwards the Greeks call that the first Sunday and
week of the fast<note place="end" n="987" id="xix.ii-p64.4"><p class="endnote" id="xix.ii-p65"> See Sir H. Nicolas, <i>Chron. of History</i>,
p. 117. Gloss. of Dates, art. <i>Hebdomadæ Græcæ</i>, observes,
that the Greeks named the weeks as beginning on Monday, and taking
in Sunday at the end. Still they count Monday the second day, etc.
Thus the first <i>Sunday</i> would be the same as with the Latins,
but the first <i>week</i> earlier. It seems probable that this was
a week earlier than here stated, see Hom. XVIII.</p></note> which we
call the first of Lent. But this is only a question as to a name.
The Homily was however delivered on the fourth day of the week, and
from the series of the Homilies, as well as from the silence of
Chrysostom, there seems plainly to be an interval of some days
between the tenth and eleventh Homilies. In this Homily, moreover,
after much premised on that calamity of Antioch, he comes down to
the former argument concerning man’s creation, and concludes his
discourse by an exhortation after his manner on avoiding
oaths.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.ii-p66">The fourteenth Tillemont thinks ought to be
placed after the eighteenth; influenced by this reason, that
Chrysostom says at the beginning, “Not a little did the devil
yesterday disturb our city, but God hath also not a little
comforted us again.” These words, he observes, denote that the
arrival of Hellebichus, and of news from Constantinople, had
already occurred. But these are mere conjectures spoken at
random.<note place="end" n="988" id="xix.ii-p66.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.ii-p67"> And dependent on the erroneous notions, that Hom.
XVII. was delivered immediately on the arrival of the
commissioners.</p></note> How many
suspicions and terrors think you were cast abroad among the people
of Antioch, whilst they hung in doubt, and were ignorant to what
result so unhappy an affair might lead? But how can we possibly
argue respecting these terrors and reports, when we are doubtless
ignorant of the greater part of them, and have so obscure a
perception of what we do know, that we can scarcely gather from
thence any indication of the time? This Homily is almost wholly on
the subject of avoiding oaths.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.ii-p68">The fifteenth Homily, Tillemont would have it, was
delivered between the tenth and eleventh, both for the reasons
above mentioned, and because Chrysostom has these words at the
commencement, ­<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="xix.ii-p68.1">Εδει καὶ τήμερον καὶ τῳ προτ™ρῳ σαββ€τῳ τὸν
περὶ νηστείας κινησαι λόγον.</span> “It had been right both
to-day and on the former Sabbath, to let the discourse turn on the
subject of fasting.” Where he understands the expression, <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="xix.ii-p68.2">τῳ προτ™ρῳ</span>, as though it were <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="xix.ii-p68.3">
τῳ πρώτῳ</span>,—the
first Saturday in Lent, entertaining however some doubts on the
point. But we, as well as Bernard Brixianus, understand it of the
earlier or preceding one.<note place="end" n="989" id="xix.ii-p68.4"><p class="endnote" id="xix.ii-p69"> It may be that, or the first in Lent, considered as
the last on which he had preached.</p></note> And we 
<pb n="325" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_325.html" id="xix.ii-Page_325" />have already proved in a former paragraph,
that no other Homily can be placed between the tenth and the
eleventh. On the occasion of the dread with which the people of
Antioch<note place="end" n="990" id="xix.ii-p69.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.ii-p70"> 
<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="xix.ii-p70.1">Πριντεδ,
Χονσταντινοπλε.</span></p></note> were
affected, he enlarges on the advantage of fear, and at the end he
preaches against the custom of swearing, and of requiring an oath
from others.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.ii-p71">The sixteenth Homily was delivered when all
were deliberating upon making their escape from the city, in
consequence of a certain report, that a sack was to take place.
Tillemont endeavours also to change the position of this Homily,
and to place it between the tenth and eleventh, which, however, as
we have said in our remarks upon the twelfth, it cannot admit of.
Tillemont further supports his argument by these words: in No. 6,
the holy Doctor says, “We have passed through the second week of
the fast.” He infers, therefore, that two weeks only of the fast
had passed away, and Tillemont on that ground determines, that it
ought to be moved out of its place. He supposes it was spoken on
the third Sunday in Lent, reckoning for the first Sunday that which
preceded the first day of the fast, which we call Quinquagesima
Sunday. But what if at Antioch at that time, that was called the
first Sunday of Lent, which according to modern custom occurs as
the first within the fast?<note place="end" n="991" id="xix.ii-p71.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.ii-p72"> He may exclude the 
τυροφ€γος, or cheese-week, as not one of the strictest
fasting. This appears to have been the case from Homily XVIII.,
which cannot well be placed anywhere but on the fourth Sunday, and
which says that half the fast is over.</p></note> For the fast did begin the Monday
after Quinquagesima, and now it begins on the Wednesday, and the
people of Antioch might not reckon that week for the first week of
Lent, just as we do not reckon it as so, and in that way this
Homily would have been delivered one week later, that is to say,
taking the Sunday after the modern custom. But even then a great
difficulty would remain, for this Homily would precede the
thirteenth and following ones. Certainly all these points are full
of perplexity, as Tillemont himself confesses, who is compelled to
leave the question, without entirely coming to any conclusion upon
it. Perhaps familiarity, and longer handling, will add to our
knowledge on so obscure a subject, which it is possible we may be
able to determine, in drawing up the life of Chrysostom at the end
of his works,<note place="end" n="992" id="xix.ii-p72.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.ii-p73"> This is chiefly a reprint of this preface. Here
nothing better is suggested than the supposition of a mistake in
transcribing. The difficulty arises from the mistaken notion, that
it was before the trials, whereas it was probably delivered a
little before the return of a messenger from Cæsarius. See Tabular
View.</p></note> more clearly
and accurately. For which reason we have purposely determined to
leave the matter doubtful. That one point only we contend for, that
this Homily cannot be placed between the tenth and eleventh, for
the reasons above mentioned. Certain things being premised as to
the timidity of the people of Antioch, and the avoiding of oaths,
Chrysostom borrows the argument of the Homily from those words of
Paul, “Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our
brother;” and shews that Paul was more glorious from bonds, than
from the power of miracles.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.ii-p74">The seventeenth was delivered after
Ellebichus, or Hellebichus, (styled Magister Militum), and
Cæsarius, (styled Magister), the persons sent by the Emperor for
the purpose of instituting an inquiry into the sedition, had
arrived at Antioch. This Hellebichus, Master of the Horse or<note place="end" n="993" id="xix.ii-p74.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.ii-p75"> 
<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="xix.ii-p75.1">Ιν 
τηε Λιφε “ανδ
Φοοτ.”</span></p></note> Foot, is
found mentioned elsewhere, and was distinguished by a reputation
for justice and clemency. Cæsarius, also styled elsewhere Master
of the Offices, enjoyed a similar reputation for high character.
But this Homily was pronounced when the people of Antioch were
almost free from fear. “We expected,” says Chrysostom (No. 1.),
“innumerable horrors, that the property of all was to be
plundered; the habitations consumed, together with their inmates;
the city snatched away from the midst of the world; and all its
relics obliterated, and its soil ploughed up: but, lo! all these
things stood only in expectance, and came not actually to pass.”
Next he relates how the monks descended from the mountains to
Antioch, that they might appease the judges, while at the same time
all the Greek philosophers deserted the city; and in what way also
the priests strenuously exerted 
<pb n="326" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_326.html" id="xix.ii-Page_326" />themselves on behalf of the people. He
declares the penalties imposed by the Emperor to be light and easy,
and no matter of grief or complaint, though the orchestra and
public bath were closed, and the dignity of a metropolis taken away
from the city of Antioch. The true dignity of Antioch was, that the
disciples of Christ were first called Christians there; that the
people of Antioch had brought assistance to the saints at
Jerusalem, when struggling with famine; that not magnitude, but
piety, is the ornament of cities. Finally, however, he says that
some were yet remaining in prison; and that others were sent into
exile. This Homily Tillemont assigns to the fourth week of Lent,
after Wednesday, but only from conjecture.<note place="end" n="994" id="xix.ii-p75.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.ii-p76"> The Life adds, The rank of metropolis was
transferred from Antioch to Laodicea, according to Theordoret, l.
5, c. 10.</p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.ii-p77">The eighteenth Homily was spoken after half the fast
was over, as Chrysostom himself says at the beginning. But
Tillemont thinks it may probably be assigned to the fifth Sunday of
Lent. He treats moreover of the true reason for fasting; of
contempt for riches; of godly sorrow, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.ii-p78">The nineteenth Homily was delivered as the title has
it, <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="xix.ii-p78.1">τῃ κυριακῃ της
ἐπισωζομ™νης</span>, or as
Fronto Ducæus reads it, <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="xix.ii-p78.2">της
σωζομ™νμς.</span> Among the Cappadocians, <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="xix.ii-p78.3">ἐπισωζομ™νη</span> is Ascension Day, as Allatius
says in his book on the Sundays and Weeks of the Greeks, adding
that the Sunday thus called is the fifth after Easter,<note place="end" n="995" id="xix.ii-p78.4"><p class="endnote" id="xix.ii-p79"> In the Life, and in Pref. to vol. 4, it is
proved from Hom. I. <i>de Annâ</i> (1), that this Homily was
actually delivered on that day. This being so, Flavian would be the
“Leader” of the Festival.</p></note> i.e. the one
which precedes the Ascension of our Lord. But Savile says that it
is<note place="end" n="996" id="xix.ii-p79.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.ii-p80"> <i>Dominica in albis</i>.</p></note> the first
Sunday after Easter; from whence he got his information I know not.
Yet there seems no doubt that it was some one of the last Sundays
in Lent, or, as Tillemont supposes, Passion-Sunday, to which I
rather incline. Chrysostom, who had been detained at home for some
time by sickness, after he has prefaced his subject with some
remarks on the Festival of the Martyrs, which had been just
celebrated at Antioch, and on the arrival of the rustics, speaks
according to his custom against oaths, and illustrates their
pernicious effects by many examples.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.ii-p81">Hitherto, in the number and order of the Homilies,
we have followed the editions of Savile and Fronto Ducæus. But
henceforth it is otherwise; for that which follows as the twentieth
in former editions, is without doubt the twenty-first and last on
the Statues. But the twenty-first is a Catechesis, which we have
placed second after another Catechesis, which was inscribed as the
first, as we remark in the Notice placed at the end of the Homilies
on the Statues, and in front of the Catechetical Lectures; since
this Catechesis ought to be placed entirely without the series of
the Homilies on the Statues. But the Homily, which is in former
editions the twenty-second, is without doubt the twentieth, which
was delivered ten days before Easter. Therefore we proceed in this
order.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.ii-p82">The twentieth Homily has these words in the title,
according to manuscripts mentioned by Fronto Ducæus, and likewise
in some of ours, and particularly that in the Royal Library,
numbered 1971. <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="xix.ii-p82.1">Ελ™χθη δš πρὸ δ™κα
ἡμερων της ƒγίας καὶ ζωοποιου του Κυρίου ἡμων 'Ιησου Χριστου
ἐκ νεκρων ‡ναστ€σεως.</span> “It was spoken ten days before
the holy and life-giving Resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ from
the dead.” This therefore is in perfect accordance with that
saying of Chrysostom, a little before the end of the Homily,
“Forty days have passed away.” This sermon then was delivered
on the Friday after the Sunday which we call Passion-Sunday. For
this day was the fortieth, beginning from the Monday after
Quinquagesima, which was the commencement of Lent. But it was
likewise the tenth before Easter, reckoning Easter itself with it.
The Homily is almost throughout against enmity and the remembrances
of injuries, and at the close is, according to Chrysostom’s
accustomed manner, directed against oaths. The twenty-first Homily,
which is the last on the Statues, seems, from what he says just
<pb n="327" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_327.html" id="xix.ii-Page_327" />at the beginning, to have been
delivered on the very day of the Lord’s Resurrection, and after
the return of Flavian the Bishop; whose journey to the Emperor, and
address to the same on behalf of the city’s preservation, as well
as the Emperor’s reply full of lenity in which he pardons the
citizens, are all particularly related by Chrysostom, occupying the
whole of this discourse. But even until the return of Flavian, the
people of Antioch were terrified by every day’s reports, and
fluctuated between hope and fear, as Chrysostom observes a little
after the beginning.</p>

<p class="c40" id="xix.iii-p7"><span class="c1" id="xix.iii-p7.1">The Argument.</span></p>

<p class="c35" id="xix.iii-p8"><i>This Homily was delivered in the Old Church</i><note place="end" n="997" id="xix.iii-p8.1"><p id="xix.iii-p9"> So called,
because situated in the more ancient part of the city of Antioch,
near the river Orontes. It was also called the Apostolic Church, as
being that founded by the Apostles.</p>

<p class="endnote" id="xix.iii-p10">This Homily was spoken a little before
the breaking out of the sedition. It has, however, always been
classed with the rest because alluded to in the next Homily.</p></note> <i>of
Antioch, while St. Chrysostom was yet a Presbyter, upon that saying
of the Apostle,</i> <i><scripRef passage="1 Tim. v. 23" id="xix.iii-p10.2" parsed="|1Tim|5|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.5.23">1
Tim. v. 23</scripRef></i><i>,
“Drink a little wine for thy stomach’s sake, and thy often
infirmities.”</i></p>

<p class="c9" id="xix.iii-p11">1. <span class="c12" id="xix.iii-p11.1">Ye</span> have heard the
Apostolic voice, that trumpet from heaven, that spiritual lyre! For
even as a trumpet sounding a fearful and warlike note, it both
dismays the enemy, and arouses the dejected spirits on its own
side, and filling them with great boldness, renders those who
attend to it invincible against the devil! And again, as a lyre,
that gently soothes with soul-captivating melody, it puts to
slumber the disquietudes of perverse thoughts; and thus, with
pleasure, instills into us much profit. Ye have heard then to-day
the Apostle discoursing to Timothy of divers necessary matters! for
he wrote to him as to the laying on of hands, saying, “Lay hands
suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men’s sins.”<note place="end" n="998" id="xix.iii-p11.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iii-p12"> <scripRef passage="1 Tim. v. 22" id="xix.iii-p12.1" parsed="|1Tim|5|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.5.22">1 Tim. v.
22</scripRef>.</p></note> And he
explained the grievous danger of such a transgression, by showing
that so men will undergo the punishment of the sins perpetrated by
others, in common with them, because they confer the power on their
wickedness by the laying on of hands. Presently again he says,
“Use a little wine for thy stomach’s sake, and thine often
infirmities.” To-day also he has discoursed to us concerning the
subjection of servants, and the madness of misers, as well as on
the arrogance of the rich, and on various other matters.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.iii-p13">2. Since then it is impossible to go through
every part, what part of the words rehearsed would you have us
select for the subject of our address to your charity?<note place="end" n="999" id="xix.iii-p13.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iii-p14"> Gr., “unto your love,” a title by which St.
Chrysostom addresses his hearers as we say, “Your Grace,”
“Your Majesty.”</p></note> For as in a
meadow, I perceive in what has been read a great diversity of
flowers; a multiplicity of roses and violets, and of lilies not a
few; and everywhere the various and copious fruit of the Spirit is
scattered around, as well as an abundant fragrance. Yea, rather the
reading of the divine Scriptures is not a meadow only, but a
paradise; for the flowers here have not a mere fragrance only, but
fruit too, capable of nourishing the soul. What part then of the
things rehearsed do you desire that we bring before you this day?
Do you wish what seems the more insignificant, and easy for any one
to understand, to be that which we should handle at present? To me,
indeed, this seems proper, and I doubt not you <pb n="332" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_332.html" id="xix.iii-Page_332" />will concur in this opinion. What
then is this that might seem plainer than anything else? What but
that, which seems so easy, and obvious for any one to say? Well!
what is that? “Use a little wine for thy stomach’s sake, and
thine often infirmities.” Well then, let us employ the whole of
our discourse upon this subject; and this we would do, not for the
love of praise, nor because we study to exhibit powers of oratory
(for the things about to be spoken are not our own, but such as the
grace of the Holy Spirit may inspire); but in order that we may
stir up those hearers who are too listless, and may convince them
of the greatness of the treasure of the holy Scriptures; and that
it is neither safe, nor free from peril, to run through them
hastily. For if indeed a text so simple and obvious as this one,
which seems to the multitude to contain nothing that need be
insisted on, should appear to afford us the means of abundant
riches, and openings toward the highest wisdom, much rather will
those others, which at once manifest their native wealth, satisfy
those who attend to them with their infinite treasures. Assuredly
then, we ought not hastily to pass by even those sentences of
Scripture which are thought to be plain; for these also have
proceeded from the grace of the Spirit; but this grace is never
small, nor mean, but great and admirable, and worthy the
munificence of the Giver.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.iii-p15">3. Let us not therefore listen carelessly;
since even they who roast the metallic earth, when they have thrown
it into the furnace, not only take up the masses of gold, but also
collect the small particles with the utmost care. Inasmuch, then,
as we likewise have to roast<note place="end" n="1000" id="xix.iii-p15.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iii-p16"> The operation of <i>roasting</i> the ore, in
the Cornish mines, consists in placing it in a comminuted state in
a furnace of a particular construction, where it is subjected to a
strong heat, but not so strong as to <i>smelt</i> it; by which the
arsenic, sulphur, and other impurities, are carried off in the form
of vapor, leaving the heavier metallic substance behind.—<span class="c12" id="xix.iii-p16.1">Tr</span>.</p></note> the gold drawn from the Apostolic
mines, not by casting it into the furnace, but by depositing it in
the thoughts of your souls; not lighting an earthly flame, but
kindling the fire of the Spirit, let us collect the little
particles with diligence.<note place="end" n="1001" id="xix.iii-p16.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iii-p17"> See on <scripRef passage="Rom. xvi. 5" id="xix.iii-p17.1" parsed="|Rom|16|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.16.5">Rom. xvi. 5</scripRef>, Hom. XXXI.</p></note> For if the saying be brief, yet is
its virtue great. For pearls too have their proper market, not
owing to the size of the substance, but the beauty of their nature.
Even so is it with the reading of the divine Scriptures; for
worldly instruction rolls forth its trifles in abundance, and
deluges its hearers with a torrent of vain babblings, but dismisses
them empty-handed, and without having gathered any profit great or
small. Not so however is it with the grace of the Spirit, but, on
the contrary, by means of small sentences, it implants divine
wisdom in all who give heed, and one sentence often times affords
to those who receive it a sufficient source of provision for the
whole journey of life.<note place="end" n="1002" id="xix.iii-p17.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iii-p18"> Socr. H. E. iv. 23. Pambos was nineteen years in

in exactness of speech. Pall. Hist. Laus. c. 10.</p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.iii-p19">4. Since then its riches are so great, let us
arouse ourselves, and receive that which is spoken with a watchful
mind; for I am preparing to plunge our discussion to an extreme
depth. The admonition itself hath no doubt seemed beside the
purpose, and superfluous to many: and they are apt to talk much in
this way, “Was Timothy of himself not able to judge what it was
needful to make use of, and did he wait to learn this of his
teacher.<note place="end" n="1003" id="xix.iii-p19.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iii-p20"> Or, the teacher, as he is called emphatically,
Doctor Gentium, see <scripRef passage="1 Tim. ii. 7" id="xix.iii-p20.1" parsed="|1Tim|2|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.2.7">1 Tim.
ii. 7</scripRef>.</p></note> And then
did the teacher not only give directions, but also set them down in
writing, graving it there as on a column of brass in his Epistle to
him? and was he not ashamed to give directions about things of this
nature, when writing in a public manner, to his disciple?” For
this end then, that thou mayest learn that the admonition, so far
from being beside the purpose, was a necessary and highly
profitable one; and that the thing proceeded not from Paul, but
from the grace of the Spirit, viz, that this should have been (I
say) not a spoken precept, but one deposited in letters, and to be
handed down to all future generations through the Epistle, I shall
proceed at once to the proof.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.iii-p21">5. For besides the subjects which have been
mentioned, there is another, about which some are no less
perplexed, enquiring within themselves on what account God
permitted a man possessing such confidence towards Him,<note place="end" n="1004" id="xix.iii-p21.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iii-p22"> Or, “claims,” <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="xix.iii-p22.1">

misinterprets the word as used by St. Chrysostom in Gen. Hom. IX.

“How does this appear,” it may be asked? From the very words of
Paul, for he does not say, on account of the “infirmity,” but
on account of the “infirmities;” and not merely
“infirmities,” but he clearly speaks of these as being
constant, when he says “thine often infirmities.” Let those

subject of enquiry is not only, that being a holy man he was sick,
and sick so continually, but that he was at the same time entrusted
with the public affairs of the world. For if he had been one of
those who have retreated to the tops of mountains; who have fixed
their cells in solitude, and who have chosen that life which is
free from all business, the matter now enquired into were no such
difficulty; but that one thrust forward in the throng, and in whose
hands the care of so many Churches was placed, and who
superintended whole cities and nations; nay, the world at large,<note place="end" n="1007" id="xix.iii-p25.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iii-p26"> He appears to have acted beyond his local charge,
as in joining in the address of several Epistles (see <scripRef passage="2 Cor. i. 1, Phil. i. 1, Col. i. 1" id="xix.iii-p26.1" parsed="|2Cor|1|1|0|0;|Phil|1|1|0|0;|Col|1|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.1.1 Bible:Phil.1.1 Bible:Col.1.1">2 Cor. i. 1, Phil. i. 1, Col. i.

much alacrity and diligence, should be subjected to the straitening
of infirmities! This it is which may most of all bewilder one who
does not duly consider it. Because, even if not for himself, yet
for others at least, it was necessary he should have health. “He
was the best general,” says the objector. “The war was waged by
him, not only against the unbeliever, but against demons, and
against the devil himself. All the enemy contended with much
vehemence, scattering the forces, and capturing prisoners;<note place="end" n="1008" id="xix.iii-p26.3"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iii-p27"> <scripRef passage="2 Tim. ii. 26" id="xix.iii-p27.1" parsed="|2Tim|2|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Tim.2.26">2 Tim.

man was able to bring back myriads to the truth, and yet he was
sick! For if,” he says, “no other injury to the cause had come
of this sickness, yet this alone was sufficient to discourage and
relax the faithful. If soldiers, when they see their general
detained in bed, become discouraged and slack for the fight, much
rather was it probable that the faithful should betray somewhat of
human nature, when they saw that teacher, who had wrought so many
signs, in continual sickness and suffering of body.”</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.iii-p28">7. But this is not all. These sceptics propose
yet a further enquiry, by asking for what reason Timothy neither
healed himself, nor was healed by his instructor, when he was
reduced to this state. Whilst the Apostles raised the dead, cast
out devils, and conquered death with abundant ease, they could not
even restore the body of one sick man! Although with respect to
other bodies, both during their own lives and after death, they
manifested such extraordinary power, they did not restore a stomach
that had lost its vigour! And what is more than this, Paul is not
ashamed, and does not blush, after the many and great signs which
he had displayed even by a simple word; yet, in writing to Timothy,
to bid him take refuge in the healing virtue of wine drinking. Not
that to drink wine is shameful. God forbid! For such precepts
belong to heretics; but the matter of astonishment is, that he
accounted it no disgrace not to be able, without this kind of
assistance, to set one member right when it was disordered.
Nevertheless, he was so far from being ashamed of this, that he has
made it manifest to all posterity.<note place="end" n="1009" id="xix.iii-p28.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iii-p29"> <i>i. e</i>., by his precept to Timothy, <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="xix.iii-p29.1">ὃ</span> (Paris reprint) seems a misprint

have brought down the subject, and how that which seemed to be
little, is full of innumerable questions. Well then, let us proceed
to the solution; for we have explored the question thus deep, in
order that, having excited your attention, we might lay up the
explanation in a safe storehouse.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.iii-p30">8. But before I proceed to solve these
questions, permit me to say something of the virtue of Timothy, and
of the loving care of Paul. For what was ever more tender hearted
than this man, who being so far distant, and encircled with so many
cares, exercised so much consideration for the health of his
disciple’s stomach, and wrote with exact attention about the
correction of his disorder? And what could equal the virtue of
Timothy? He so despised luxury, and derided the sumptuous table, as
to fall into sickness from excessive austerity, and intense
fasting. For that he was not naturally so infirm a person, but had
overthrown the strength of his stomach by fasting and water
drinking; you may hear Paul himself carefully making this plain.
For he does not simply say, “use a little wine;” but having
said before, “drink no longer water,” he then brings forward
his counsel as to the drinking of wine. And this expression “no
longer” was a manifest proof, that till then he had drunk water,
and on that account was become infirm. Who then would not wonder at
his divine wisdom and strictness? He laid hold on the very heavens,
and sprang to the highest point of virtue. And his Teacher
testifies this, when he thus speaks, “I have sent unto you
Timothy, who is my beloved and faithful son in the Lord;”<note place="end" n="1010" id="xix.iii-p30.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iii-p31"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. iv. 17" id="xix.iii-p31.1" parsed="|1Cor|4|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.4.17">1 Cor.

Paul calls him “a son,” and a “faithful and beloved son,”
these words are sufficient to show that he possessed every kind of
virtue. For the judgments of the saints are not given according to
favour or enmity, but are free from all prejudice. Timothy would
not have been so enviable, if he had been Paul’s son naturally,
as he was now admirable, inasmuch as having no connection with him
according to the flesh, he introduced himself by the relationship
of piety into the Apostle’s adoption; 
<pb n="334" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_334.html" id="xix.iii-Page_334" />preserving the marks of his spiritual

a bull, so he drew the yoke along with him, to whatever part of the
world he went: and did not draw it the less on account of his
youth, but his ready will made him emulate the labours of his
teacher. And of this, Paul himself was again a witness when he
said, “Let no man despise him, for he worketh the work of the
Lord as I also do.”<note place="end" n="1013" id="xix.iii-p33.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iii-p34"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. xvi. 10" id="xix.iii-p34.1" parsed="|1Cor|16|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.16.10">1 Cor.

the ardour of Timothy was the very counterpart of his

<p class="c10" id="xix.iii-p35">9. Furthermore, in order that he might not be
thought to have said these things out of favour or kindness, he
makes his hearers themselves to be witnesses of the virtue of his
son, when he says, “But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son
with a father, so he hath served with me in the Gospel;”<note place="end" n="1014" id="xix.iii-p35.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iii-p36"> <scripRef passage="Phil. ii. 22" id="xix.iii-p36.1" parsed="|Phil|2|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Phil.2.22">Phil. ii.

“ye have had experience of his virtue, and of his approved
soul.” At the same time, however, that he had reached to this
height of good works, he did not thereby grow confident; but was
full of anxiety and fear, therefore also he fasted rigidly, and was
not affected as many are, who, when they have kept themselves to it
but ten, or perhaps twenty months,<note place="end" n="1015" id="xix.iii-p36.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iii-p37"> A course of discipline was usual with those who
intended to live a truly Christian life. St. Chrysostom spent four
years in retirement. St. Augustin also practised self-discipline
before his baptism (Conf. ix. 14, Tr. p. 165), and afterwards x.
47, p. 239; see the end of Hom. XXVI. on <scripRef passage="Rom. xvi. 2, 4" id="xix.iii-p37.1" parsed="|Rom|16|2|0|0;|Rom|16|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.16.2 Bible:Rom.16.4">Rom. xvi. 2, 4</scripRef>. And of

altogether. He, I say, was in no wise thus affected, nor did he say
anything like this to himself. “What further need have I of
fasting? I have gotten the mastery of myself; I have overcome my
lusts; I have mortified my body; I have affrighted demons; I have
driven away the devil; I have raised the dead; I have cleansed
lepers; I am become terrible to the adverse powers; what further
need have I of fasting, or to seek safety from that quarter?”
Anything like this he did not say, he did not think of; but, in
proportion as he abounded with innumerable good works, so much the
more did he fear and tremble.<note place="end" n="1016" id="xix.iii-p37.3"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iii-p38"> St. Paul does not say, “I fear;” but he does

unutterable words; and taken part in such mysteries; and traversed

Corinthians, said, I fear “lest by any means having preached to

good works. For then the devil becomes fiercer; then he is more
savage, when he beholds us regulating our lives with carefulness!
When he sees the cargo of virtue stowed together, and the lading
become heavy, then he is in haste to accomplish a more grievous
shipwreck! For the insignificant and abject man, although he may be
supplanted and fall, brings not so great an injury to the common
cause. But the man who has been standing most conspicuously as it
were on some eminence of virtue, and who is one manifestly seen and
known of all men, and admired of all; when he is assaulted and
falls, causes great ruin and loss. Not only because he falls from
this elevation but makes many of those who look up to him more
negligent. And as it is in the body, some other limb may be
destroyed without there being any great damage, but if the eyes be
deprived of sight, or the head be seriously injured, the whole body
is rendered useless; so also we must say of the saints, and of
those who have performed the highest good works; when such are
extinguished, when they contract any stain, they bring upon all the
rest of the body a universal and intolerable injury!</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.iii-p42">10. Timothy then, being aware of all these
things, fortified himself on every side; for he knew that youth is
an age of difficulty; that it is unstable; easily deceived; very
apt to slip; and requires an exceedingly strong bridle. It is
indeed a sort of combustible pile easily catching anything from
without, and quickly kindled; and for that reason he took care to
smother it on all sides; and strove to abate the flame in every
way. The steed<note place="end" n="1020" id="xix.iii-p42.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iii-p43"> See on <scripRef passage="Rom vii. 6" id="xix.iii-p43.1" parsed="|Rom|7|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.7.6">Rom vii. 6</scripRef>; Hom. XII. p. 191.</p></note> that was
unmanageable and restive he curbed with much vehemence, until he
had tamed him of his wanton tricks; until he had made him docile;
and delivered him under entire control, into the hands of that
reason which is the charioteer.<note place="end" n="1021" id="xix.iii-p43.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iii-p44"> Or “which guided himself.” A less easy
construction, but better suited to the context. Compare Plato’s
famous illustration (probably known to St. Chrysostom), Phædrus,
246, in which Reason is represented as a charioteer driving a
chariot drawn by two horses, one of an aspiring, the other of a
grovelling nature.</p></note> “Let the body,” saith he,
“be infirm; but let not the soul be infirm; let the flesh be
bridled; but let not the race of the spirit towards heaven be
checked.” <pb n="335" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_335.html" id="xix.iii-Page_335" />But
moreover, one might especially wonder at the man for this, that
being thus diseased, and struggling with such an infirmity, he did
not become indifferent to God’s business, but flew everywhere
faster than those who have sound and vigourous constitutions; now
to Ephesus; now to Corinth; often to Macedonia and Italy; appearing
everywhere, by land and by sea, with the Teacher, sharing in
everything his struggles and continuous dangers; while the
spiritual wisdom of his soul was not put to shame by his bodily
infirmity. Such a thing is zeal for God! such lightness of wing
does it impart! For as with those who possess well-regulated and
sound constitutions, strength is of no avail, if the soul is
abject, slothful, and stupid; so with those who are reduced to
extreme weakness, no hurt arises from their infirmity, if the soul
be noble and well awake.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.iii-p45">11. The admonition however, and the counsel,
such as it is, appears to some to give authority for drinking wine
too freely. But this is not so. If indeed we closely investigate
this very saying, it rather amounts to a recommendation of
abstinence. For just consider that Paul did not at first, nor at
the outset give this counsel. But when he saw that all strength was
overthrown, then he gave it; and even then not simply, but with a
certain prior limitation. He does not say merely, “Use wine,”
but “a little” wine; not because Timothy needed this admonition
and advice, but because we need it. On this account, in writing to
him, he prescribes the measure and limit of wine-drinking for us;
bidding him drink just so much as would correct disorder; as would
bring health to the body, but not another disease. For the
immoderate drinking of wine produces not fewer diseases of body and
of soul, than much drinking of water, but many more, and more
severe; bringing in as it does upon the mind the war of the
passions, and a tempest of perverse thoughts, besides reducing the
firmness of the body to a relaxed and flaccid condition. For the
nature of land that is long disturbed by a superabundance of water,
is not thereby so much dissolved, as the force of the human frame
is enfeebled, relaxed, and reduced to a state of exhaustion, by the
continual swilling of wine. Let us guard then against a want of
moderation on either side, and let us take care of the health of
the body, at the same time that we prune away its luxurious
propensities. For wine was given us of God, not that we might be
drunken, but that we might be sober; that we might be glad, not
that we get ourselves pain. “Wine,” it says, “maketh glad the
heart of man,”<note place="end" n="1022" id="xix.iii-p45.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iii-p46"> <scripRef passage="Ps. ciii. 15" id="xix.iii-p46.1" parsed="|Ps|3|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.3.15">Ps. ciii.
15</scripRef>.</p></note> but thou makest it matter for
sadness; since those who are inebriated are sullen beyond measure,
and great darkness over-spreads their thoughts. It is the best
medicine, when it has the best moderation to direct it. The passage
before us is useful also against heretics, who speak evil of
God’s creatures; for if it had been among the number of things
forbidden, Paul would not have permitted it, nor would have said it
was to be used. And not only against the heretics, but against the
simple ones among our brethren, who when they see any persons
disgracing themselves from drunkenness, instead of reproving such,
blame the fruit given them by God, and say, “Let there be no
wine.” We should say then in answer to such, “Let there be no
drunkenness; for wine is the work of God, but drunkenness is the
work of the devil. Wine maketh not drunkenness; but intemperance
produceth it. Do not accuse that which is the workmanship of God,
but accuse the madness of a fellow mortal. But thou, while omitting
to reprove and correct the sinner, treatest thy Benefactor with
contempt!”</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.iii-p47">12. When, therefore, we hear men saying such things,
we should stop their mouths; for it is not the use of wine, but the
want of moderation which produces drunkenness, Drunkenness! that
root of all evils. Wine was given to restore the body’s weakness,
not to overturn the soul’s strength; to remove the sickness of
the flesh, not to destroy the health of the spirit. Do not then, by
using the gift of God immoderately, afford a handle to the foolish
and the impudent. For what is a more wretched thing than
drunkenness! The drunken man is a living corpse. Drunkenness is a
demon self-chosen, a disease without excuse, an overthrow that
admits of no apology; a common shame to our kind. The drunken man
is not only useless in our assemblies; not only in public and
private affairs; but the bare sight of him is the most disgusting
of all things, his breath being stench. The belchings, and gapings,
and speech of the intoxicated, are at once unpleasant and
offensive, and are utterly abhorrent to those who see and converse
with them; and the crown of these evils is, that this disease makes
heaven inaccessible to drunkards, and does not suffer them to win
eternal blessedness: for besides the shame attending those who
labour under this disease here, a grievous punishment is also
awaiting them there! Let us cut off then this evil habit, and let
us hear Paul saying, “Use a little 
<pb n="336" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_336.html" id="xix.iii-Page_336" />wine.” For even this little he permits him on
account of his infirmity; so that if infirmity had not troubled
him, he would not have forced his disciple to allow himself even a
small quantity, since it is fitting that we should always mete out
even the needful meat and drink, which are given us, by occasions
and necessities; and by no means go beyond our need, nor do
anything unmeaningly and to no purpose.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.iii-p48">13. But since we have now learnt the tender care of
Paul, and the virtue of Timothy, come and let us, in the next
place, turn our discourse to the actual solution of those
questions. What then are the questions? For it is necessary again
to mention them, that the solution of them may be plainer. For what
reason then did God permit that such a saint, and one entrusted
with the management of so many matters, should fall into a state of
disease; and that neither Timothy himself nor his teacher had
strength to correct the disorder, but needed that assistance which
was to be had by drinking wine? Such, indeed, were the questions
proposed. But it is needful to bring forward a precise solution; so
that if any should fall not only into the like sickness and
disease, but into poverty, and hunger, and bonds, and torments, and
discomfitures, and calumnies, and into all those evils which belong
to the present life, although they were great and wonderful saints,
you may still be able to find, even for their case, in the things
which are to-day to be advanced, an exact and very clear reply to
those who are disposed to find fault. For ye have heard many asking
such questions, as, “Why ever is it that such an one, a moderate
and meek man, comes to be dragged daily before the seat of judgment
by another who is lawless and wicked, and to suffer evils without
number, and God permits this? For what reason again was another
man, upon false accusation, unjustly put to death?” “Such a
man,” says the objector, “was drowned; another was thrown down
a precipice; and we might speak of many saints, as well in our own
days as in the days of our forefathers, who have suffered divers
and chequered tribulations.” To the end, therefore, that we may
see the reason of these things, and that we ourselves may not be
disturbed, nor overlook the case of others who thus meet with a
stumbling-block, we should attend with earnest heed to the reasons
now about to be advanced.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.iii-p49">14. For of the diversified and manifold affliction
which befalls the saints, I have reasons eight in number to declare
unto your love. Therefore let all direct themselves to me with the
strictest attention, knowing that there will be no pardon nor
excuse left us hereafter for stumbling at the things which happen,
if after all, when there are so many reasons, we are just as much
perplexed and disturbed as if there were not one to be found.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.iii-p50">The first reason then is, that God permits them to
suffer evil, that they may not too easily be exalted into
presumption, by the greatness of their good works and miracles.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.iii-p51">The second, that others may not have a greater
opinion of them than belongs to human nature, and take them to be
gods and not men.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.iii-p52">The third, that the power of God may be made
manifest, in prevailing, and overcoming, and advancing the word
preached, through the efficacy of men who are infirm and in
bonds.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.iii-p53">The fourth, that the endurance of these themselves
may become more striking, serving God, as they do, not for a
reward; but showing even such right-mindedness as to give proof of
their undiminished good will towards Him after so many evils.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.iii-p54">The fifth, that our minds may be wise concerning the
doctrine of a resurrection. For when thou seest a just man, and one
abounding in virtue, suffering ten thousand evils, and thus
departing the present life, thou art altogether compelled, though
unwillingly, to think somewhat of the future judgment; for if men
do not suffer those who have laboured for themselves, to depart
without wages and recompense; much more cannot God design, that
those who have so greatly laboured should be sent away uncrowned.
But if He cannot intend to deprive those of the recompense of their
labours eventually, there must needs be a time, after the end of
the life here, in which they will receive the recompense of their
present labours.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.iii-p55">The sixth, that all who fall into adversity may have
a sufficient consolation and alleviation, by looking at such
persons, and remembering what sufferings have befallen them.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.iii-p56">The seventh, that when we exhort you to the virtue
of such persons, and we say to every one of you, “Imitate Paul,
emulate Peter,” ye may not, on account of the surpassing
character of their good works, slothfully shrink from such an
imitation of them, as deeming them to have been partakers of a
different nature.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.iii-p57">The eighth, that when it is necessary to call any
blessed, or the reverse, we may learn whom we ought to account
happy, and whom unhappy and wretched.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.iii-p58">These then are the reasons; but it is necessary to
establish them all from the Scriptures, 
<pb n="337" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_337.html" id="xix.iii-Page_337" />and to show with exactness that all that has been
said on this subject is not an invention of human reasoning, but
the very sentence of the Scriptures. For thus will what we say be

saints, that they may exercise moderation and lowliness, and that
they may not be puffed up by their miracles and good works, and
that God permits it for this end; we may hear David the prophet,
and Paul saying the same. The former says, “It is good for me,

latter having said, “I was caught up into the third heaven,

“That I might not be exalted above measure,” for this reason,
saith he, God permitted “the messengers of Satan to buffet me;”
by messengers of Satan, indeed, he means not particular demons, but
men<note place="end" n="1025" id="xix.iii-p61.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iii-p62"> So he explains it also on the passage, on 2 Cor.,
Hom. XXVI. See also on <scripRef passage="Rom. viii. 6" id="xix.iii-p62.1" parsed="|Rom|8|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.8.6">Rom. viii. 6</scripRef>, Trans. p. 251, and Bp. Bull,

ministering for the devil, the unbelievers, the tyrants, the
heathens, who perseveringly molested, and unceasingly worried him.
And what he says is just this: “God was able to repress these
persecutions and successive tribulations; but since I had been
caught up into the third heaven, and transported to Paradise, lest
through the abundance of these revelations I might be lifted up and
think much of myself, he permitted these persecutions, and suffered
these messengers of Satan to buffet me with persecutions and
afflictions, that I might not be too much exalted.” For although
Paul and Peter, and all that are like them, be holy and wonderful
men, as indeed they are, yet they are but men, and require much
caution lest they should be too easily exalted; and as saints more
than others. For nothing is so apt to exalt to presumption as a
conscience full of good works, and a soul that lives in confidence.
To the end, therefore, that these might suffer nothing of this
kind, God permitted that there should be temptations and
tribulations; these being powerful to keep them down, and to
persuade to the exercise of moderation in all things.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.iii-p63">16. That this very particular also contributes
much to the showing forth of God’s power, you may learn even from
the same Apostle, who told us the former. In order that you may not
say, (what indeed unbelievers think), that God in permitting this,
is some infirm being, and suffers such persons to be continually
afflicted, from not being able to deliver His own from dangers:
this very thing, I say, observe how Paul has demonstrated by means
of these events, showing not only that the events were far from
accusing Him of weakness, but that they proved His power more
strikingly to all. For having said, “There was given me a thorn
in the flesh; a messenger of Satan to buffet me,” and having thus
signified his repeated trials, he goes on to add, “For this thing
I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me; and He
said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee, for My strength is
perfected in weakness.”<note place="end" n="1026" id="xix.iii-p63.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iii-p64"> <scripRef passage="2 Cor. xii. 8, 9" id="xix.iii-p64.1" parsed="|2Cor|12|8|12|9" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.12.8-2Cor.12.9">2 Cor.

seen then when ye are in weakness; and yet through you, who seem to
grow weak, the word preached is magnified, and is sown in all
quarters.” When therefore he was led to the dungeon, after having
received a great number of stripes, he took prisoner the keeper of
the prison.<note place="end" n="1027" id="xix.iii-p64.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iii-p65"> <scripRef passage="Acts xvi. 24" id="xix.iii-p65.1" parsed="|Acts|16|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.16.24">Acts xvi.

were in the stocks, and his hands in the chain; and the prison
shook at midnight while they were singing hymns. See you, how His
power was perfected in weakness? If Paul had been at large, and had
shaken that building, the thing would not have been so wonderful.
“For this reason,” He saith, “remain bound; and the walls
shall be shaken on every side, and the prisoners shall be loosed;
in order that My power may appear the greater, when through thee,
confined and in fetters, all that are in bonds shall be loosed.”
This very circumstance then it was which at the time astounded the
keeper of the prison, that being so forcibly confined, he, through
prayer alone, prevailed to shake the foundations, and throw open
the doors of the prison, and to unbind all the prisoners. Nor is
this the only occasion. But with Peter too, and Paul himself, as
well as the other disciples, one may see this occurring constantly;
and in the midst of persecution, the grace of God ever flourishing,
and appearing by the side of the tribulations, and thus proclaiming
His power. Wherefore He saith, “My grace is sufficient for thee,
for My strength is perfected in weakness.”</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.iii-p66">17. But to show that many would be too often ready
to imagine things of them above human nature, unless they saw them
enduring such afflictions, hear how Paul was afraid on this very
point; “For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a
fool, but now I forbear, lest any man should think of me above

were not only filled with astonishment, but led forth bulls, after
crowning them with garlands, and were preparing to offer sacrifice
to Paul and Barnabas. Observe the malice of the Devil. By those
very same persons through whom the Lord was at work, to purge out
ungodliness from the world, by the same did that enemy try to
introduce it, again persuading them to take men for gods; which was
what he had done in former times. And this is especially that which
introduced the principle and root of idolatry. For many after
having had success in wars, and set up trophies, and built cities,
and done divers other benefits of this kind to the people of those
times, came to be esteemed gods by the multitude, and were honoured
with temples, and altars; and the whole catalogue of the Grecian
gods is made up of such men. That this, therefore, may not be done

said to you, ‘Do you worship (colis) Peter?’ Answer,…‘I do
not worship Peter, but I worship God, whom Peter also worships.’
Then doth Peter love thee.” This passage of St. Chrysostom is,
however, remarkable, as pointing out a tendency which has since
been carried to excess.</p></note> God permitted them constantly to
be banished,—to be scourged,—to fall into diseases; that the
abundance of bodily infirmity, and the multiplicity of those
temptations, might convince those who were then with them, both
that they were men, who wrought such wonders, and that they
contributed nothing of their own power; but that it was mere grace,
that wrought through them all these miracles. For if they took men
for gods, who had done but mean and vile things, much rather would
they have thought these to be such, had they suffered nothing
proper to humanity, when they performed miracles, such as no one
had ever before seen or heard of. For if when they were scourged,
thrown down precipices, imprisoned, banished, and placed in peril
every day, there were, notwithstanding, some who fell into this
impious opinion, how much rather would they have been thus
regarded, had they endured nothing which belongs to human
nature!</p>

affliction; and the fourth is, that the saints might not be
supposed to serve God from a hope of present prosperity. For many

reproached by God on his account, and having nothing to say; when
he could neither answer the accusations against himself, nor impugn
the virtue of this just man; took refuge at once in this defence,
speaking thus, “Doth Job fear thee for nought? Hast thou not made

then did God? Being desirous to show, that it was not for reward

they are enwrapt all around with the garment soaked in oil; but
when casting this aside, they are brought forward unclothed into
the arena; then above all they strike the spectators on every side
with astonishment at the proportion of their limbs, there being no
longer anything to conceal them; so also was it with Job. When he
was enveloped in all that wealth, it was not visible to the many,
what a man he was. But when, like the wrestler, that strips off his
garment, he threw it aside, and came naked to the conflicts of
piety, thus unclothed, he astonished all who saw him;<note place="end" n="1040" id="xix.iii-p79.4"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iii-p80"> <scripRef passage="Job i. 21" id="xix.iii-p80.1" parsed="|Job|1|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Job.1.21">Job i.

the very theatre of angels shouted at beholding his fortitude of
soul, and applauded him as he won his crown! For, as I have already
observed, he was not so well seen of men, when clad in all that
wealth, as when, casting it away like a garment, he exhibited
himself naked as it were in a theatre, in the midst of the world,
and all admired his vigor of soul, evidenced as this was not only
by his being stripped of all things, but by the conflict, and by
his patience in respect of his infirmity. And as I said before, God
Himself did not smite him; in order that the devil might not again
say, “Thou hast spared him, and hast not inflicted so great a
trial as was necessary:” but he gave to the adversary the
destruction of his cattle, and power over his flesh. “I am
sure,” saith He, “of this wrestler; therefore I do not forbid
thee to impose on him whatever struggles thou desirest.” But as
those who are well skilled in the sports of the palæstra, and have
reason to rely on their art and bodily strength, often do not seize
their antagonists upright, nor take an equal advantage, but suffer
them to take them by the middle,<note place="end" n="1041" id="xix.iii-p80.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iii-p81"> See the wrestling match at Patroclus’ funeral,

he tells us, innumerable evils during the present life; if then
there is no other life to be hoped for, what can be more wretched
than our condition? Hence it is evident that our affairs are not
bounded within the limits of this present state; and this becomes
manifest from our trials. For God could never suffer those who have
endured so many and so great evils, and who have spent all the
present life in trials and dangers without number, to be without a
recompense of far greater gifts; and if he could not suffer this,
it is certain that he has prepared another, a better and brighter
life, in which he will crown those who have wrestled in the cause
of godliness, and proclaim their praises in the presence of the
whole world. So that when you see a just man straitened and
afflicted; and in sickness, and in poverty, as well as innumerable
other woes, till he ends this present life; say to thyself, that if
there were no resurrection and judgment, God would not have
permitted one, who endured such great evils for His sake, to depart
hence without enjoying any good thing; from whence it is evident,
that for such He has prepared another life, and one which is
sweeter and much more endurable. For if 
<pb n="340" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_340.html" id="xix.iii-Page_340" />it were not so, then he would not suffer many of
the wicked to luxuriate through the present life; and many of the
just to remain in ten thousand ills: but since there is provided
another life, in which he is about to recompense every man
according to his deserts; one for his wickedness, another for his
virtue; on that account he forbears, while he sees the former
enduring evil, and the latter living in luxury.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.iii-p91">21. And that other<note place="end" n="1049" id="xix.iii-p91.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iii-p92"> τὴν ›τ™ραν.</p></note> reason too I will endeavor to
bring forward from the Scriptures. But what was it? It was, that we
might not say, when exhorted to the same virtue, that they were
partakers of another nature, or were not men. On this account, a
certain one speaking of the great Elias, says, “Elias was a man
of like passions with us.”<note place="end" n="1050" id="xix.iii-p92.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iii-p93"> <scripRef passage="James v. 17" id="xix.iii-p93.1" parsed="|Jas|5|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Jas.5.17">James v.

guarantees a community of nature.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.iii-p96">22. But that you may learn that this also
teaches us to consider those blessed whom we ought to consider

who are enjoying quietness, but those who are in affliction for
God’s sake, and who are in tribulation, whom we must applaud,

speaks the prophet: “Their right hand is a right hand of

that the probation, which comes of tribulation, fixes in us the
hope of the good things to come, and that the abiding in trials
causes us to have a good hope of the future? So that I did not say
rashly, that these tribulations themselves mark out to us hopes of
a resurrection, and make those who are tried the better; for, he
saith, “as gold is tried in a furnace, so an acceptable man in

<p class="c10" id="xix.iii-p105">24. There is besides a tenth reason to
mention; and what is it, but the one I have before frequently
referred to? viz. that if we have any spots, we thus put them away.
And the patriarch, making this matter plain, said to the rich man,
“Lazarus hath received<note place="end" n="1060" id="xix.iii-p105.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iii-p106"> “‡π™λαβεν,” which word he seems

25</scripRef>.</p></note> hence
“he is comforted.” And besides this, we may find another
reason, which is to this effect; that our crowns and rewards are
thus increased. For in proportion as tribulations are more intense,
so also are the rewards augmented; yea, even far more: “for the
sufferings of the present time,” it is said, “are not worthy to
be compared to the glory that shall be revealed in us.”<note place="end" n="1062" id="xix.iii-p107.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iii-p108"> <scripRef passage="Rom. viii. 18" id="xix.iii-p108.1" parsed="|Rom|8|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.8.18">Rom.

then being the reasons which we have to advance for the afflictions
of the saints, let us not take our trials amiss, or be distressed,
or disturbed on account of them; but both ourselves discipline our
own souls, and teach others to do the same.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.iii-p109">25. And if, O beloved, thou seest a man living in
virtue, keeping fast hold of spiritual wisdom, pleasing God, yet
suffering innumerable ills, do not stumble! And although thou seest
any one devoting himself to spiritual affairs, and about to achieve
something useful, yet presently supplanted, be not discouraged! For
I know there are many who ofttimes propose a question to this
effect: “Such a one,” say they, “was performing a pilgrimage
to some Martyr’s shrine; and whilst conveying money to the poor,
met with a shipwreck, and lost all. Another man, in doing the like,
fell among robbers, and scarcely saved his life, leaving the place
in a state of nudity.” What then should we say? Why that in
neither of these cases need one be sad. For if the one met with a
shipwreck, <pb n="341" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_341.html" id="xix.iii-Page_341" />yet he hath
the fruit of his righteousness complete inasmuch as he fulfilled
all his own part. He collected the money together, he stowed it
away,<note place="end" n="1063" id="xix.iii-p109.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iii-p110"> Or, devoted it ‡π™θετο.</p></note> he took it
with him, he departed on his pilgrimage; but the shipwreck that
followed was not of his own will. “But why did God permit it?”
In order that he might make the man approved. “But,” says one,
“the poor were deprived of the money.” Thou dost not so care
for the poor, as the God who made them? for if they were deprived
of these things, He is able to provide a greater supply of wealth
for them from another quarter.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.iii-p111">26. Let us not then call Him to account for what He
does; but let us give Him glory in all things. For it is not
lightly and to no purpose that He often permits such events. But
beside that He does not overlook those that would have enjoyed
comfort from such wealth; and instead of it, affords them some
other supply of sustenance; He also makes him who suffers the
shipwreck more approved, and provides him a greater reward;
inasmuch as the giving thanks to God, when one falls into such
calamities, is a far greater matter than giving alms. For not what
we give in alms only, but whatever we have been deprived of by
others, and borne it with fortitude; this too brings us much fruit.
And that you may learn, that the latter is indeed the greater
thing, I will make it evident from what befell Job. He, when a
possessor of wealth, opened his house to the poor, and whatever he
had he bestowed; but he was not so illustrious when he opened his
house to the poor, as when, upon hearing that his house had fallen
down, he did not take it impatiently. He was not illustrious when
he clad the naked with the fleece of his flock, as he was
illustrious and renowned when he heard that the fire had fallen,
and consumed all his flocks, and yet gave thanks. Before, he was a
lover of man; now, he was a lover of Wisdom. Before, he had
compassion on the poor; but now he gave thanks to the Lord! And he
did not say to himself, “Why is it that this hath happened? The
flocks are consumed from which thousands of the poor were
supported; and if I was unworthy to enjoy such plenty, at least He
should have spared me for the sake of the partakers.”</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.iii-p112">27. Nothing of this sort did Job utter, no nor
think, because he knew that God was dispensing all things for good.
That you may learn, moreover, that he gave a heavier blow to the
devil after this, when, being stripped of all things, he gave
thanks, than when, being in possession of them, he gave alms;
observe, that when he was in possession, the devil could utter a
certain suspicion, and however false, he yet could utter it:
“Doth Job serve thee for nought?” But when he had taken all,
and stripped him of everything, and the man yet retained the same
good will towards God, from that time his shameless mouth was
stopped, and had nothing further to allege. For the just man was
more illustrious than in his former state.<note place="end" n="1064" id="xix.iii-p112.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iii-p113"> So Ben. render λαμπρότερος γὰρ
‡πὸ τῶν προτ™ρων ὁ δίκαιος ἦν. No other sense seems
possible, yet this is bad Greek: probably the right reading is
γ€ρ ἢ ‡πὸ, and the sense, “he was
more illustrious than from his former deeds.”</p></note> For to bear nobly and thankfully
the privation of all things, is a far greater thing than it was to
give alms whilst living in affluence; and it has been accordingly
demonstrated in the case of this just man. Before, there was much
benignity to his fellow-servants; now, there was exceeding love
shown towards the Lord!</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.iii-p114">28. And I do not lengthen out this discourse
without purpose; forasmuch as there are many, who, often whilst
engaged in works of mercy, as supporting widows, have been spoiled
of all their substance. Some again, by the accident of some fire,
have lost their all; some have met with shipwreck; others, by false
informations and injuries of that sort, though they have done many
alms-deeds, have fallen into the extremes of poverty, sickness, and
disease, and have obtained no help from any one. Lest we should say
then, as many often do, “No man knoweth anything;”<note place="end" n="1065" id="xix.iii-p114.1"><p id="xix.iii-p115"> A proverbial
expression, as it should seem, intended to deny that there is any
evidence of a particular Providence. Comp. Iph. in Taur., 480.</p>

<p class="endnote" id="xix.iii-p122">But the sentiment of Iphigenia will admit
a pious interpretation.</p></note> what has
just been said may suffice to remove all perplexity on this point.
Suppose it is objected that “such an one, after having done many
alms-deeds, has lost all?” And what if he had lost all? If he
gives thanks for this loss, he will draw down much greater favour
from God! And he will not receive twofold, as Job did, but a
hundredfold in the life to come. But if here he does endure evil,
the very circumstance of his sustaining all with fortitude will
bring him a greater treasure; for God permits him to fall from
plenty to poverty, for the purpose of calling him thus to the more
frequent exercises, and greater conflicts. Hath it happened as is
often the case, that the fire seizing upon thy house, hath burnt it
up and devoured all thy substance? Remember <pb n="342" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_342.html" id="xix.iii-Page_342" />what happened to Job; give
thanks to the Lord, who though he was able to forbid, did not
forbid it; and thou wilt receive as great a reward as if thou hadst
deposited all thy wealth in the hands of the poor! But dost thou
spend thy days in poverty and hunger, and in the midst of a
thousand dangers? Remember Lazarus who had to buffet with disease,
and poverty, and desolateness, and those other innumerable trials;
and that after so high a degree of virtue!<note place="end" n="1066" id="xix.iii-p122.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iii-p123"> St. Chrysostom is frequent in his praises of
the <i>patience</i> of Lazarus, as in his Disc. <i>Quod nemo
læditur nisi a seipso</i>, sec. 10, Ben. iii. p. 455, and in his
Homilies <i>de Lazaro</i>, Ben. i. p. 720, &amp;c.</p></note> Remember the Apostles, who lived
in hunger, and thirst, and nakedness; the prophets, the patriarchs,
the just men, and you will find all these not among the rich or
luxurious, but among the poor, the afflicted, and the
distressed!</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.iii-p124">29. Saying these things to thyself, give
thanks unto the Lord, that he hath made thee to be of this part,
not hating thee, but loving thee greatly; since He would not have
permitted those men either to suffer thus, if he had not
exceedingly loved them, because He made them more illustrious by
these evils. There is nothing so good as thanksgiving; even as
there is nothing worse than blasphemy. We should not wonder that
when we become intent upon spiritual things, we suffer much that is
grievous. For as thieves do not dig through and assiduously keep
watch there, where there is hay, and chaff, and straw, but where
there is gold and silver; so also the devil besets those especially
who are engaged in spiritual matters. Where virtue is, there are
many snares! where alms-giving is, there is envy! But we have one
weapon which is the best, and sufficient to repel all such engines
as these; in everything to give thanks to God. Tell me, did not
Abel, when offering the first fruits to God, fall by the hand of
his brother? But yet God permitted it, not hating one who had
honoured him, but loving him greatly; and beside that which came of
that excellent sacrifice, providing him another crown by martyrdom.

For if, foreknowing that we should suffer nothing of a grievous
kind, we then put our hands to the work of religion, we should not
seem to be doing anything great, as having such a pledge of safety.
But as it is, those who do such things are the more to be wondered
at, even for this; because, though they foresee dangers, and
punishments, and deaths, and ten thousand evils, still they did not
desist from those good works, nor become less zealous from the
expectation of terrors.<note place="end" n="1068" id="xix.iii-p125.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iii-p126"> al. deaths.</p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.iii-p127">30. As, therefore, the Three Children said,
“There is a God in heaven, who is able to deliver us; and if not,
let it be known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods,

luxury! God hath not pledged to thee His recompense and His promise
here; but everything that is splendid for thee in the future life!
Be glad and rejoice then, if when thou hast thyself done any good
action, thou receive the contrary, or if thou see another suffering
this; inasmuch as this becomes to thee the source of a higher
recompense! Do not be downcast: nor give up thy zeal, nor become
the more torpid; but rather press onward with more eagerness; since
even the Apostles, when they preached, although scourged, stoned,
and constant inmates of the prisons, did not only after deliverance
from dangers, but also in those very dangers, announce with greater
forwardness the message of Truth. Paul is to be seen in prison,
yea, even in chains, instructing and initiating:<note place="end" n="1073" id="xix.iii-p131.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iii-p132"> Baptizing,

Tr</span>.</p></note> and moreover doing the very same
in a court of justice, in shipwreck, in tempest, and in a thousand
dangers. Do thou too imitate these saints, and cease not from good
works, so long as thou art able; and although thou seest the devil
thwarting thee ten thousand times, never fall back! Thou perchance,
bearing with thee thy wealth, hast met with shipwreck; but Paul
carrying the word, far more precious than all wealth, was going to
Rome, and was wrecked; and sustained innumerable hardships. And
this he himself signified, when he said, “Many times we desired
to come unto you, but Satan hindered us.”<note place="end" n="1074" id="xix.iii-p132.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iii-p133"> <scripRef passage="1 Thess. ii. 18" id="xix.iii-p133.1" parsed="|1Thess|2|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Thess.2.18">1 Thess.

revealing the more abun<pb n="343" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_343.html" id="xix.iii-Page_343" />dantly His power, and showing that
the multitude of things which the devil did, or prevented from
being done, neither lessened nor interrupted the preaching of the
Gospel. On this account Paul gave God thanks in all things; and
knowing that he was himself thereby rendered more approved, he
exhibited his exceeding forwardness on every occasion, letting none
of these impediments prevent him!</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.iii-p134">31. As often then as we are frustrated in spiritual
works, so often let us again take them in hand; and let us not say,
“for what reason did God permit these impediments?” for He
permitted them to this end, that He might show thy alacrity much
more to others, and thy great love; this being the special mark of
one that loves, never to desist from those things which are
approved by him whom he loves. The man, indeed, who is flaccid and
listless, will fall back from the first shock; but he who is
energetic and alert, although he be hindered a thousand times, will
devote himself so much the more to the things of God; fulfilling
all as far as he is able; and in everything giving thanks. This
then let us do! Thanksgiving is a great treasure; large wealth; a
good that cannot be taken away; a powerful weapon! Even as
blasphemy increases our present mishap; and makes us lose much more
beside than we have lost already. Hast thou lost money? If thou
hast been thankful, thou hast gained thy soul; and obtained greater
wealth; having acquired a greater measure of the favour of God. But
if thou blasphemest, thou hast, besides this, lost thine own
safety; and hast not regained possession of thy wealth; yea and thy
soul, which thou hadst, thou hast sacrificed!</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.iii-p135">32. But since our discourse has now turned to
the subject of blasphemy, I desire to ask one favor of you all, in
return for this my address, and speaking with you; which is, that
you will correct on my behalf the blasphemers of this city. And
should you hear any one in the public thoroughfare, or in the midst
of the forum, blaspheming God; go up to him and rebuke him; and
should it be necessary to inflict blows, spare not to do so. Smite
him on the face; strike his mouth; sanctify thy hand with the blow,
and if any should accuse thee, and drag thee to the place of
justice, follow them thither; and when the judge on the bench calls
thee to account, say boldly that the man blasphemed the King of
angels! For if it be necessary to punish those who blaspheme an
earthly king, much more so those who insult God. It is a common
crime, a public injury; and it is lawful for every one who is
willing, to bring forward an accusation. Let the Jews and Greeks
learn, that the Christians are the saviours of the city; that they
are its guardians, its patrons, and its teachers. Let the dissolute
and the perverse also learn this; that they must fear the servants
of God too; that if at any time they are inclined to utter such a
thing, they may look round every way at each other, and tremble
even at their own shadows, anxious lest perchance a Christian,
having heard what they said, should spring upon them and sharply
chastise them. Have you not heard what John did? He saw a man that
was a tyrant overthrowing the laws of marriage; and with boldness,
he proclaimed in the midst of the forum, “It is not lawful for
thee to have thy brother Philip’s wife.”<note place="end" n="1075" id="xix.iii-p135.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iii-p136"> <scripRef passage="Mark vi. 18" id="xix.iii-p136.1" parsed="|Mark|6|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Mark.6.18">Mark vi.
18</scripRef>.</p></note> But I urge thee on, not against a
prince or a judge; nor against the marriage ordinance outraged; nor
in behalf of fellow-servants insulted. But I require thee to
castigate an equal, for insolence against the Lord. Truly, if I had
said unto thee, punish and correct those kings or judges who
transgress the laws, would you not say that I was mad? But John
forsooth acted thus. So that even this is not too much for us. Now
then, at least, correct a fellow-servant; an equal; and although it
should be necessary to die, do not shrink from chastising<note place="end" n="1076" id="xix.iii-p136.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iii-p137"> σωφρονίζειν, which
implies a kind intention.</p></note> a brother.
This is thy martyrdom, since John was also a martyr. And although
he was not commanded to sacrifice, nor to worship an idol, yet for
the sacred laws that were despised, he laid down his head. Do thou
too then contend, even to the death, for the truth, and God will
fight for thee! And make me not this cold reply. “What matters it
to me? I have nothing in common with him.”<note place="end" n="1077" id="xix.iii-p137.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iii-p138"> <i>i.e</i>., the blasphemer. <span class="c12" id="xix.iii-p138.1">Tr</span>.</p></note> With the devil alone we have
nothing in common, but with all men we have many things in common;
for they partake of the same nature with us; they inhabit the same
earth, and they are nourished with the same food; they have the
same Lord; they have received the same laws, and are invited to the
same blessings with ourselves. Let us not say then, that we have
nothing in common with them; for this is a satanic speech; a
diabolical inhumanity. Therefore let us not give utterance to such
words, but exhibit such a tender care as becomes
brethren!</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.iii-p139">33. This indeed I, for my part, engage with the
strictest certainty, and pledge myself to you all, that if all you
who are present will but choose to take in hand the safety of <pb n="344" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_344.html" id="xix.iii-Page_344" />the inhabitants of this city, we
shall speedily have it amended throughout. And this, even although
but the least part of the city is here; the least as to multitude,
but the chief part as it respects piety. Let us take in hand the
safety of our brethren! One man inflamed with zeal is sufficient to
reform a whole community! But when not merely one, or two, or
three, but so great a multitude are able to take on them the care
of the neglected, it is in no other way but by our own supineness,
and not from our want of strength, that the majority perish and
fall. Is it not indeed absurd? When we happen to see a fight taking
place in the forum, we go into the midst of it, and reconcile the
combatants! But why do I speak of a fight? If, perchance, we see an
ass fallen down, we all make haste to stretch out a hand to raise
him up. Yet we neglect our perishing brethren! The blasphemer is an
ass; unable to bear the burden of his anger, he has fallen. Come
forward and raise him up, both by words and by deeds; and both by
meekness and by vehemence; let the medicine be various. And if we
thus administer our own part, and take pains for the safety of our
neighbours, we shall soon become objects of desire and affection to
the very persons who have the benefit of our correction; and what
is more than all, we shall enjoy those good things which are laid
up in store. Which God grant that we may all obtain, by the grace
and mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ; through whom and with whom, to
the Father with the Holy Ghost, be glory and power and honor, both
now and always, and forever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p class="c35" id="xix.iv-p2"><i>Spoken in Antioch in the Old Church, as it was
called, while he was a presbyter, on the subject of the calamity
that had befallen the city in consequence of the tumult connected
with the overthrow of the Statues of the Emperor Theodosius, the
Great and Pious. And on the saying of the Apostle, “Charge them
that are rich that they be not high-minded,”</i> <i><scripRef passage="1 Timothy vi. 17" id="xix.iv-p2.2" parsed="|1Tim|6|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.6.17">1 Timothy vi. 17</scripRef></i><i>. And against

or what shall I speak of? The present season is one for tears, and
not for words; for lamentation, not for discourse; for prayer, not
for preaching. Such is the magnitude of the deeds daringly done; so
incurable is the wound, so deep the blow, even beyond the power of
all treatment, and craving assistance from above. Thus it was that
Job, when he had lost all, sat himself down upon a dunghill; and
his friends heard of it, and came, and seeing him, while yet afar
off, they rent their garments, and sprinkled themselves with ashes,
and made great lamentation.<note place="end" n="1078" id="xix.iv-p3.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iv-p4"> <scripRef passage="Job ii. 8, 12" id="xix.iv-p4.1" parsed="|Job|2|8|0|0;|Job|2|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Job.2.8 Bible:Job.2.12">Job ii.

cities around to do, to come to our city and to lament with all
sympathy what has befallen us. He then sat down on his dunghill;
she is now seated in the midst of a great snare. For even as the
devil then leaped violently the flocks, and herds, and all the
substance of the just man, so now hath he raged against this whole
city. But then, as well as now, God permitted it; then, indeed,
that he might make the just man more illustrious by the greatness
of his trials; and now, that he may make us more sober-minded by
the extremity of this tribulation. Suffer me to mourn over our
present state. We have been silent seven days, even as the friends
of Job were.<note place="end" n="1079" id="xix.iv-p4.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iv-p5"> <scripRef passage="Job ii. 13" id="xix.iv-p5.1" parsed="|Job|2|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Job.2.13">Job ii.

to open my mouth to-day, and to bewail this common
calamity.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.iv-p6">2. Who, beloved, hath bewitched us? Who hath envied
us? Whence hath all this change come over us? Nothing was more
dignified than our city! Now, never was anything more pitiable! The
populace so well ordered and quiet, yea, even like a tractable and
well tamed steed, always submissive to the hands of its rulers,
hath now so suddenly started off with us, as to have wrought such
evils, as one can hardly dare to mention.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.iv-p7">I mourn now and lament, not for the greatness of
that wrath which is to be expected, but for the extravagance of the
frenzy which has been manifested! For although the Emperor should
not be provoked, or in anger, although he were neither to punish,
nor take <pb n="345" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_345.html" id="xix.iv-Page_345" />vengeance; how, I
pray, are we to bear the shame of all that has been done? I find
the word of instruction broken off by lamentation; scarcely am I
able to open my mouth, to part my lips, to move my tongue, or to
utter a syllable! So, even like a curb, the weight of grief checks
my tongue, and keeps back what I would say.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.iv-p8">3. Aforetime there was nothing happier than
our city; nothing more melancholy than it is now become. As bees
buzzing around their hive, so before this the inhabitants every day
flitted about the forum, and all pronounced us happy in being so
numerous. But behold now, this hive hath become solitary! For even
as smoke does those bees, so fear hath driven away our swarms; and
what the prophet says, bewailing Jerusalem, we may fitly say now,
“Our city is become ‘like a terebinth that hath lost its
leaves,<note place="end" n="1080" id="xix.iv-p8.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iv-p9"> E.V., <i>as an oak whose leaf fadeth</i>,
Heb. הלָא” which may be either
tree.</p></note> and as a
garden that hath no water.’”<note place="end" n="1081" id="xix.iv-p9.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iv-p10"> <scripRef passage="Isa. i. 30" id="xix.iv-p10.1" parsed="|Isa|1|30|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.1.30">Isa. i.
30</scripRef>.</p></note> For in like manner as a garden
when its irrigation fails, exhibits the trees stripped of their
leaves, and bare of their fruits, so has it now fared with our
city. For the help from above having forsaken her, she stands
desolate stripped of almost all her inhabitants.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.iv-p11">4. Nothing is sweeter than one’s own
country; but now, it has come to pass that nothing is more bitter!
All flee from the place which brought them forth, as from a snare.
They desert it as they would a dungeon; they leap out of it, as
from a fire. And just as when a house is seized upon by the flames,
not only those who dwell therein, but all who are near, take their
flight from it with the utmost haste, eager to save but their bare
bodies; even so now too, when the wrath of the Emperor is expected
to come as a fire<note place="end" n="1082" id="xix.iv-p11.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iv-p12"> Ben. πυρ‚ς, “burning
pile” (as of beams, &amp;c.).</p></note> from above, every one presses to
go forth in time, and to save the bare body, before the fire in its
progress reaches them. And now our calamity has become an enigma; a
flight without enemies; an expulsion of inhabitants without a
battle; a captivity without capture! We have not seen the fire of
barbarians, nor beheld the face of enemies: and yet we experience
the sufferings of captives. All men now hear of our calamities; for
receiving our exiles, they learn from them the stroke which has
fallen upon our city.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.iv-p13">5. Yet I am not ashamed, nor blush at this.
Let all men learn the sufferings of the city, that, sympathizing
with their mother, they may lift up their united voice to God from
the whole earth; and with one consent entreat the King of heaven
for their universal nurse and parent.<note place="end" n="1083" id="xix.iv-p13.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iv-p14"> St. Chrysostom alludes more than once in these
Homilies to the distinction referred to in <scripRef passage="Acts xi. 26" id="xix.iv-p14.1" parsed="|Acts|11|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.11.26">Acts xi. 26</scripRef>, as one that

after this period. It was almost demolished by this visitation,
A.D. 340, and so again at several periods afterwards. More than
60,000 of its inhabitants perished from the same cause, A.D.
588.</p></note> but now
the very souls of the inhabitants totter! Then the foundations of
the houses shook, but now the very foundations of every heart
quiver; and we all see death daily before our eyes! We live in
constant terror, and endure the penalty of Cain; a more pitiable
one than that of those who were the former inmates of the prison;
undergoing as we now do a new and strange kind of siege, far more
terrible than the ordinary kind. For they who suffer this from
enemies, are only shut up within the walls; but even the forum has
become impassable to us, and every one is pent up within the walls
of his own house! And as it is not safe for those who are beseiged
to go beyond the walls, while the enemy without is encamped around;
so neither, to many of those who inhabit this city, is it safe to
go out of doors, or to appear openly; on account of those who are
everywhere hunting for the innocent as well as the guilty; and
seizing them even in the midst of the forum, and dragging them to
the court of justice, without ceremony, and just as chance
directs.<note place="end" n="1085" id="xix.iv-p15.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iv-p16"> ƒπλῶς
καὶ ὠς žτυχεν, <i>i.e</i>., without regard to the
ordinary forms of justice used in apprehending the guilty or
suspected.</p></note> For this
reason, free-men sit in doors shackled up with their domestics;
anxiously and minutely enquiring of those to whom they may safely
put the question, “Who has been seized to-day; who carried off;<note place="end" n="1086" id="xix.iv-p16.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iv-p17"> Or executed, ‡πήχθη, see Hom. III. (6).</p></note> or
punished? How was it? and in what manner?” They live a life more
wretched than any kind of death; being compelled daily to mourn the
calamities of others; while they tremble for their own safety, and
are in no better case than the dead; inasmuch as they are already
dead with fear.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.iv-p18">6. But if any one who is devoid of this fear
and anguish, chooses to enter the forum, he is presently driven
back to his own dwelling, by the cheerless spectacle; finding
hardly perchance one or two people, and those hanging their heads
and creeping about with downcast looks, where but a few days before
the multitude swept along more incessantly than<note place="end" n="1087" id="xix.iv-p18.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iv-p19"> Or “more than rivalled,” 
‡π™κρυπτεν.</p></note> the streams of rivers. Yet all
these have now been driven away from us! And, as when many trees in
a thick wood of oak are cut down in all directions, the spectacle
becomes a melancholy one, even like that of a head with many
patches of baldness; even so the city itself, its inhabitants being
dimin<pb n="346" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_346.html" id="xix.iv-Page_346" />ished and but
few appearing here and there, is now become dreary, and sheds a
heavy mist of sorrow over those who witness it. And not the ground
only, but the very nature of the air, and even the circle of the
sun’s beams, seem now to me to look mournful, and to shine more
dimly; not that the elements change their nature, but that our eyes
being confused by the cloud of sadness, are unable to receive the
light of the rays clearly, or with the same relish. This is what
the prophet of old bewailed, when he said, “The sun shall go down
at noon, and the day shall be darkened.”<note place="end" n="1088" id="xix.iv-p19.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iv-p20"> <scripRef passage="Amos viii. 9" id="xix.iv-p20.1" parsed="|Amos|8|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Amos.8.9">Amos
viii. 9</scripRef>.</p></note> And this he said, not as though
the Day Star<note place="end" n="1089" id="xix.iv-p20.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iv-p21"> τοῦ ˆστρου.</p></note> should be
eclipsed, or the day should disappear, but because those who are in
sorrow, are not able to perceive the light even of noon day on
account of the darkness of their anguish; which indeed has been the
case now. And wherever any one looks abroad, whether upon the
ground or upon the walls; whether upon the columns of the city, or
upon his neighbours, he seems to see night and deep gloom; so full
is all of melancholy! There is a silence big with horror, and
loneliness everywhere; and that dear hum of the multitude is
stifled; and even as though all were gone beneath the earth, so
speechlessness hath now taken possession of the city; and all men
seem like stones, and being oppressed by the calamity like a gag on
their tongues; they maintain the profoundest silence, yea, such a
silence as if enemies had come on them, and had consumed them all
at once by fire and sword!</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.iv-p22">7. Now is it a fit season to say, “Call for
the mourning women, that they may come, and for the cunning women,
and let them take up a wailing. Let your<note place="end" n="1090" id="xix.iv-p22.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iv-p23"> E.V., that our eyes may.</p></note> eyes run down with water, and your
eyelids gush out with tears.”<note place="end" n="1091" id="xix.iv-p23.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iv-p24"> <scripRef passage="Jer. ix. 17, 18" id="xix.iv-p24.1" parsed="|Jer|9|17|9|18" osisRef="Bible:Jer.9.17-Jer.9.18">Jer. ix.
17, 18</scripRef>.</p></note> Ye hills take up wailing, and ye
mountains lamentation! Let us call the whole creation into sympathy
with our evils. So great a city, and the head of those which lie
under the eastern sky, is in danger of being torn away from the
midst of the civilized world! She that had so many children, has
now suddenly become childless, and there is no one who shall come
to her aid! For he who has been insulted has not an equal in
dignity upon earth; for he is a monarch; the summit and head of all
here below! On this account then let us take refuge in the King
that is above. Him let us call in to our aid. If we may not obtain
the favour of heaven, there is no consolation left for what has
befallen us!</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.iv-p25">8. Here I could wish to end this discourse; for the
minds of those who are in anguish are indisposed to extend their
discourses to a great length. And as when some dense cloud has
formed, and flying under the solar rays, returns back to him all
his splendour again, so indeed does the cloud of sadness, when it
stands before our souls, refuse to admit an easy passage for the
word, but chokes it and restrains it forcibly within. And this is
the case not only with those who speak, but with those who hear;
for as it does not suffer the word to burst forth freely from the
soul of the speaker, so neither does it suffer it to sink into the
mind of those who listen, with its natural power. Therefore also
the Jews of old time, while slaving at the mud and bricks, had not
the heart to listen to Moses, while he repeatedly told them great
things respecting their future deliverance; despondency making
their minds inaccessible to the address, and shutting up their
sense of hearing. I could have wished then, as to myself, to have
put an end here to my discourse; but thinking that it is not only
the nature of a cloud to intercept the forward passage of the
sun’s rays, but that often just the opposite happens to the
cloud; since the sun continually falling upon it with much warmth,
wears it away, and frequently breaks through the midst of it; and
shining forth all at once, meets cheerfully the gaze of the
beholders. This also I myself expect to do this day; and the word
being continually associated with your minds, and dwelling in them,
I hope to burst the cloud of sadness, and to shine through your
understandings again, with the customary instruction!</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.iv-p26">9. But afford me your attention! Lend me your
ears awhile! Shake off this despondency! Let us return to our
former custom;<note place="end" n="1092" id="xix.iv-p26.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iv-p27"> ἦθος.</p></note> and as we
have been used always to meet here with gladness, so let us also do
now, casting all upon God. And this will contribute towards our
actual deliverance from calamity. For should the Lord see that His
words are listened to carefully; and that our love of divine wisdom
stands the trial of the difficulty of these times, He will quickly
take us up again, and will make out of the present tempest a calm
and happy change. For this too is a thing in which it behoves the
Christian to differ from the unbelievers, the bearing all things
nobly; and through hope of the future, soaring above the attack of
human evils. The believer hath his stand on the Rock; for this
reason he cannot be overthrown by the dashing of the billows. For
should the waves of temptation rise, they 
<pb n="347" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_347.html" id="xix.iv-Page_347" />cannot reach to his feet. He stands too lofty for
any such assault. Let us not then sink down, beloved! We do not
care so much for our own safety, as God who made us. There is not
so much solicitude on our part, lest we suffer any dreadful
misfortune, as with Him who bestowed upon us a soul, and then gave
us so many good things beside. Let us mount on the wings of these
hopes, and hear the things about to be spoken with our accustomed
readiness.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.iv-p28">10. I made a prolonged discourse lately unto
you beloved, and yet I saw all following it up, and no one turning
back in the middle of the course.<note place="end" n="1093" id="xix.iv-p28.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iv-p29"> οὐδ™να ἐκ μ™σης
ὑποστρ™ψαντα τῆς ὁδοῦ. He evidently alludes to
the first Homily—a long one—and which it appears from what he
has just said, was preached seven days before this, <span class="c12" id="xix.iv-p29.1">Tr</span>. Montfaucon counts the seven days from the
sedition. The order of reading the Epistles as <i>lessons</i>
perhaps cannot be ascertained. The <i>Codex Ebneri</i> (Bodl. Auct.
B. 123), has marks, but of later date than the text, for reading on
the several days of thirty-four weeks: the passage presently
mentioned and that in Hom. I. fall on Thursday and Friday in the
27th, but this does not seem to the purpose.</p></note> I return thanks to you for that
readiness, and have received the reward of my labours. But there
was another reward, besides that attention, which I asked of you at
that time; perchance you know and recollect it. And what was the
reward? That you should punish and chastise the blasphemers that
were in the city; that ye should restrain those who are violent and
insolent against God! I do not think that I then spoke these things
of myself; but that God, foreseeing what was coming, injected these
words into my mind; for if we had punished those who dared to do
such things, that which has now happened would never have happened.
How much better would it have been, if necessity so required, to
run into danger; yea, to suffer in castigating and correcting such
persons (which would have brought us a martyr’s crown), than now
to fear, to tremble, and to expect death, from the insubordination
of such persons! Behold, the crime was that of a few, but the blame
comes on all! Behold, through these, we are all now placed in fear,
and are ourselves suffering the punishment of what these men dared
to do! But if we had taken them in time, and cast them out of the
city, and chastised them, and corrected the sick member, we should
not have been subjected to our present terror. I know that the
manners of this city have been of a noble character from old
times;<note place="end" n="1094" id="xix.iv-p29.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iv-p30"> See Hom. III. (i.) fin.</p></note> but that
certain strangers, and men of mixed race,—accursed and pernicious
characters,—hopeless of their own safety, have perpetrated what
has been perpetrated. For this very reason I was always lifting up
my voice, and unceasingly bearing my testimony, saying, Let us
punish the madness of those blasphemers,—let us control their
spirit, and provide for their salvation;—yea, though it be
necessary to die in doing it, the deed would yet bring us great
gain: let us not overlook the insult done to our common Lord;
overlooking such things will bring forth some great evil to our
city!</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.iv-p31">11. These things I foretold, and they have now
actually taken place;—and we are paying the penalty of that
listlessness! You overlooked the insult that was done unto
God!—Behold, he hath permitted the Emperor to be insulted, and
peril to the utmost to hang over all, in order that we might pay by
this fear the penalty of that listlessness; was it then vainly, and
to no purpose I foretold these things, and assiduously urged your
Charity? But nevertheless, nothing was done. Let it, however, be
done now; and being chastened by our present calamity, let us now
restrain the disorderly madness of these men. Let us shut up their
mouths, even as we close up pestiferous fountains; and let us turn
them to a contrary course, and the evils which have taken hold of
the city shall undoubtedly be stayed. The Church is not a theatre,
that we should listen for amusement. With profit ought we to depart
hence, and some fresh and great gain should we acquire ere we leave
this place. For it is but vainly and irrationally we meet together,
if we have been but captivated for a time, and return home empty,
and void of all improvement from the things spoken.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.iv-p32">12. What need have I of these plaudits, these
cheers and tumultuous signs of approval?<note place="end" n="1095" id="xix.iv-p32.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iv-p33"> Of public applause in the Church, see

the crimes of each one will bring some general and intolerable
damage to the city. Behold, while we are unconscious of any part in
this transaction, we are no less affrighted than those who were
daringly engaged in it! We are dreading lest the wrath of the
Emperor should descend upon all; and it is not sufficient for us to
say in defence, “I was not present; I was not an accomplice, nor
a participator in these acts.” “For this reason,” he may
reply, “thou shalt be punished, and pay the extreme penalty,
because thou wert not present; and didst not <pb n="348" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_348.html" id="xix.iv-Page_348" />check, nor restrain the rioters, and
didst not run any risk for the honour of the Emperor! Hadst thou no
part in these audacious deeds? I commend this, and take it well.
But thou didst not check these things when being done. This is a
cause of accusation!” Such words as these, we shall also hear
from God, if we silently suffer the continuance of the injuries and
insults committed against Him. For he also who had buried his
talent in the earth, was called to account, not for crimes done by
himself, for he had given back the whole of that which was
entrusted to him, but because he had not increased it; because he
had not instructed others; because he had not deposited it in the
hands of the bankers; that is, he had not admonished, or
counselled, or rebuked, or amended those unruly sinners who were
his neighbours. On this account he was sent away without reprieve
to those intolerable punishments! But I fully trust that though ye
did not before, ye will now at least perform this work of
correction, and not overlook insult committed against God. For the
events which have taken place are sufficient, even if no one had
given any warning, to convince men ever so disposed to be
insensible, that they must exert themselves for their own
safety.</p>

says, “the rich in this world,” he makes it manifest, that
there are others who are rich, that is, in the world to come: such

opulence, when there is good unmixed, and not subject to any
change. Not such was the case of that rich man who despised him,
but he became the poorest of mankind. Afterwards at least when he
sought to obtain but a drop of water, he did not get possession
even of that, to such extreme poverty was he come. For this reason
he calls them rich “in the present world,” to teach thee that
along with the present life, worldly wealth is annihilated. It goes
no further, neither does it change its place with its migrating
possessors, but it often leaves them before their end; which
therefore he shows by saying, “Neither trust in uncertain
riches;” for nothing is so faithless as wealth; of which I have
often said, and will not cease to say, that it is a runaway,
thankless servant, having no fidelity; and should you throw over
him ten thousand chains, he will make off dragging his chains after
him. Frequently, indeed, have those who possessed him shut him up
with bars and doors, placing their slaves round about for guards.
But he has over-persuaded these very servants, and has fled away
together with his guards; dragging his keepers after him like a
chain, so little security was there in this custody. What then can
be more faithless than this? what more wretched than men devoted to
it? When men endeavour with all eagerness to collect so frail and
fleeting a thing, they do not hear what the prophet saith: “Woe

certain, but the enjoyment uncertain. Very often you toil and
endure trouble for enemies. The inheritance of your wealth after
your decease, coming as it does, in many instances, to those who
have injured you, and plotted against you in a thousand ways, has
assigned you the sins for your part, but the enjoyment to
others!</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.iv-p41">14. But here, it is worthy of enquiry, for
what reason he does not say, “Charge those who are rich in the
present world, not to be rich; charge them to become poor; charge
them to get rid of what they have;” but, “charge them, not to
be high-minded.” For he knew that the root and foundation of
riches is pride; and that if any man understood how to be
unassuming, he would not make much ado about the matter. Tell me,
indeed, for what reason thou leadest about so many servants,
parasites, and flatterers, and all the other forms of pomp? Not for
necessity, but only for pride; to the end that by these thou mayest
seem more dignified than other men! Besides, he knew that wealth is
not forbidden if it be used for that which is necessary. For as I
observed,<note place="end" n="1102" id="xix.iv-p41.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iv-p42"> Hom. I.</p></note> wine is
not a bad thing, but drunkenness is so. A covetous man is one
thing, and a rich man is another thing. The covetous man is not
rich; he is in want of many things, and while he needs many things,
he can never be rich. 
<pb n="349" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_349.html" id="xix.iv-Page_349" />The covetous man is a keeper, not a master,
of wealth; a slave, not a lord. For he would sooner give any one a
portion of his flesh, than his buried gold. And as though he were
ordered and compelled of some one to touch nothing of these hidden
treasures, so with all earnestness he watches and keeps them,
abstaining from his own, as if it were another’s. And certainly,
they are not his own. For what he can neither determine to bestow
upon others, nor to distribute to the necessitous, although he may
sustain infinite punishments, how can he possibly account his own?
How does he hold possession of those things, of which he has
neither the free use, nor enjoyment? But besides this,—Paul is
not accustomed to enjoin everything on every man, but accommodates
himself to the weakness of his hearers, even, indeed, as Christ
also did. For when that rich man came to him, and asked him
concerning Life, he did not say at once, “Go, sell that thou
hast,”<note place="end" n="1103" id="xix.iv-p42.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iv-p43"> <scripRef passage="Matt. xix. 16" id="xix.iv-p43.1" parsed="|Matt|19|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.19.16">Matt.
xix. 16</scripRef>.</p></note> but
omitting this, he spoke to him of other commandments. Nor
afterwards, when he challenged<note place="end" n="1104" id="xix.iv-p43.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iv-p44"> Or “invited,” as some read, 
προσεκαλ™σατο. Ben. 
προεκαλ™σατο.</p></note> Him and said, “What lack I
yet?” did He simply say, “Sell what thou hast;” but, “If
thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast.”<note place="end" n="1105" id="xix.iv-p44.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iv-p45"> <scripRef passage="Matt. xix. 21" id="xix.iv-p45.1" parsed="|Matt|19|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.19.21">Matt.
xix. 21</scripRef>.</p></note> “I lay
it down for your determination. I give you full power to choose. I
do not lay upon you any necessity.” For this reason also, Paul
spoke nothing to the rich concerning poverty, but concerning
humility; as well because of the weakness of his hearers, as
because he perfectly knew, that could he bring them to exercise
moderation, and to be free from pride, he should also quickly free
them from eagerness about being rich.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.iv-p46">15. And further, after giving this admonition,
“not to be high-minded,” he also taught the manner in which
they would be able to avoid being so. And how was it? That they
should consider the nature of wealth, how uncertain and faithless
it is! therefore he goes on to say, “Neither trust in uncertain
riches.” The rich man is not one who is in possession of much,
but one who gives much. Abraham was rich, but he was not covetous;
for he turned not his thoughts to the house of this man, nor prayed
into the wealth of that man; but going forth he looked around
wherever there chanced to be a stranger, or a poor man, in order
that he might succour poverty, and hospitably entertain the
traveller. He covered not his roof with gold, but fixing his tent
near the oak, he was contented with the shadow of its leaves. Yet
so illustrious was his lodging, that angels were not ashamed to
tarry with him; for they sought not splendour of abode, but virtue
of soul. This man then let us imitate, beloved, and bestow what we
have upon the needy. That lodging was rudely prepared, but it was
more illustrious than the halls of kings. No king has ever
entertained angels; but he, dwelling under that oak, and having but
pitched a tent, was thought worthy of that honour: not receiving
the honour on account of the meanness of his dwelling, but enjoying
that benefit on account of the magnificence of his soul, and the
wealth therein deposited.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.iv-p47">16. Let us too, then, adorn not our houses,
but our souls in preference to the house. For is it not disgraceful
to clothe our walls with marble, vainly and to no end, and to
neglect Christ going about naked? What does thy house profit thee,
O man! For wilt thou take it with thee when thou departest? This
thou canst not take with thee, when thou departest. But thy soul,
when thou departest, thou shalt assuredly take with thee! Behold
now this great danger has overtaken us! Let your houses stand by
you! Let them deliver you from the threatened peril! but they
cannot! And ye yourselves are witnesses, who are leaving them
solitary, and hurrying forth to the wilderness; fearing them as ye
would do snares and nets! Let riches now lend assistance! But it is
no time for them to do so! If then the power of riches is found
wanting before the wrath of man, much rather will this be the case,
before the divine and inexorable tribunal! If it is but a man that
is provoked and offended, and even now gold is of no avail, much
more will the power of money be utterly impotent then, when God is
angry, who has no need of wealth! We build houses that we may have
a habitation; not that we may make an ambitious display. What is
beyond our wants, is superfluous and useless. Put on a sandal which
is larger than your foot! you will not endure it; for it is a
hindrance to the step. Thus also a house larger than necessity
requires, is an impediment to your progress towards heaven. Do you
wish to build large and splendid houses? I forbid it not; but let
it be not upon the earth! Build thyself tabernacles in heaven, and
such that thou mayest be able to receive others;<note place="end" n="1106" id="xix.iv-p47.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iv-p48"> He may allude to

Laz</i>. 3, he cautions men against thinking that friends could

pieces. Why art thou mad about fleeting things; and things that
must be left here? Nothing is more slippery <pb n="350" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_350.html" id="xix.iv-Page_350" />than wealth. To-day it is for thee;
tomorrow it is against thee. It arms the eyes of the envious
everywhere. It is a hostile comrade, a domestic enemy; and ye are
witnesses of this, who possess it, and are in every way burying and
concealing it from view; as even now too our very wealth makes the
danger more insupportable to us! Thou seest indeed the poor ready
for action, disengaged, and prepared for all things; but the
wealthy in great perplexity, and wandering about, seeking where
they may bury their gold, or seeking with whom they may deposit it!
Why, O man, dost thou seek thy fellow slaves? Christ stands ready
to receive, and to keep thy deposits for thee; and not to keep
only, but also to augment them, and to pay them back with much
interest. Out of His hand no man can forcibly take them away. And
He not only keeps the deposit, but for this very thing He also
frees thee from thy perils. For among men, they who receive
treasures in trust think that they have done us a favour, in
keeping that of which they took charge; but with Christ it is the
contrary; for He does not say that He has conferred, but that He
has received a favour, when He receives thy deposited treasures;
and for the guardianship which He exercises over thy wealth, He
does not demand a recompense of thee, but gives thee a
recompense!</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.iv-p49">17. What defence then can we claim, or what excuse,
when we pass by Him who is able to keep, and who is thankful for
the trust giving in return great and unspeakable rewards, and in
place of this guardianship commit our treasures to men who have not
the power to keep them, and who think they grant us a favour, and
pay us back at last only that which was given them. Thou art a
stranger and a pilgrim with respect to the things here! Thou hast a
country which is thine own in the heavens! There transfer
all;—that before the actual enjoyment, thou mayest enjoy the
recompense here. He who is nourished with good hopes, and is
confident respecting things to come, hath here already tasted of
the kingdom! For nothing ordinarily so repairs the soul, and makes
a man better, as a good hope of things to come; so that if thou
transfer thy wealth there, thou mayest then provide for thy soul
with suitable leisure. For they who spend all their endeavours upon
the decoration of their dwelling, rich as they are in outward
things, are careless of that which is within, letting their soul
abide desolate and squalid, and full of cobwebs. But if they would
be indifferent to exterior things, and earnestly expend all their
attention upon the mind, adorning this at all points; then the soul
of such men would be a resting place for Christ. And having Christ
for its inhabitant, what could ever be more blessed? Wouldest thou
be rich? Have God for thy friend, and thou shalt be richer than all
men!—Wouldest thou be rich? Be not high-minded!—This rule is
suitable not only to things future, but to things present. For
there is no such object of envy, as a man of wealth; but when pride
is super-added, a two-fold precipice is formed; the war becomes
fiercer on all sides. But if you know how to exercise moderation,
you undermine the tyranny of envy by your humility; and you possess
whatever you do possess with safety. For such is the nature of
virtue, that it not only profits us, as it respects futurity, but
it also here bestows a present reward.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.iv-p50">18. Let us not then be high-minded in
reference to riches, or indeed to any other thing; for if even in
spiritual things the man who is high-minded is fallen, and undone,
much more so as to carnal things. Let us be mindful of our nature.
Let us recollect our sins. Let us understand what we are; and this
will provide a sufficient groundwork for complete humility. Tell me
not, “I have laid up the revenues of this or that number of
years; myriads of talents of gold; gains that are increasing every
day.” Say as much as you will, you say all in vain, and to no
purpose. Very often in one hour, yea, in one short moment, just as
the light dust, when the wind rushes down upon it from above, are
all these things swept out of the house by a blast. Our life is
full of such examples, and the Scriptures abound with lessons of
this sort. He who is rich to-day, is poor tomorrow. Wherefore, I
have often smiled, when reading wills that said, let such a man
have the ownership of these fields, or of this house, and another
the use thereof. For we all have the use, but no man has the
ownership.<note place="end" n="1107" id="xix.iv-p50.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iv-p51"> δεσποτεία, literally,
the lordship.</p></note> For
although riches may remain with us all our lifetime, undergoing no
change, we must transfer them in the end, whether we will or no,
into the hands of others; having enjoyed only the use of them, and
departing to another life naked and destitute of this ownership!
Whence it is plain, that they only have the ownership of property,
who have despised its use, and derided its enjoyment. For the man
that has cast his substance away from him, and bestowed it on the
poor, he uses it as he ought; and takes with him the ownership of
these things when he departs, not being stripped of the possession
even in <pb n="351" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_351.html" id="xix.iv-Page_351" />death, but
at that time receiving all back again; yea, and much more than
these things, at that day of judgment, when he most needs their
protection,<note place="end" n="1108" id="xix.iv-p51.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iv-p52"> προστασίας. Comp.
Hom. <i>adv. Jud</i>. vii. v. fin., where he speaks of the

Cat. Aur</i>. on that passage.</p></note> and when
we shall all have to render up an account of the deeds we have
done. So that if any one wishes to have the possession of his
riches, and the use and the ownership entire, let him disencumber
himself from them all; since, truly, he who doth not this must at
all events be separated from them at death; and frequently before
his death will lose them, in the midst of dangers and innumerable
ills.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.iv-p53">19. And this is not the only disaster, that
the change comes suddenly; but that the rich man comes unpractised
to the endurance of poverty. But not so the poor man; for he
confides not in gold and silver, which are lifeless matter, but in
“God, who giveth us all things richly to enjoy.” So that the
rich man stands in more uncertainty than the poor man,
experiencing, as he does, frequent and diversified changes. What is
the sense of this? “Who giveth to us all things richly to
enjoy.”<note place="end" n="1109" id="xix.iv-p53.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iv-p54"> <scripRef passage="1 Tim. vi. 17" id="xix.iv-p54.1" parsed="|1Tim|6|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.6.17">1 Tim.

all those things with liberality, which are more necessary than
riches; such, for example, as the air, the water, the fire, the
sun; all things of this kind. The rich man is not able to say that
he enjoys more of the sunbeams than the poor man; he is not able to
say that he breathes more plenteous air: but all these are offered
alike to all. And wherefore, one may say, is it the greater and
more necessary blessings, and those which maintain our life, that
God hath made common; but the smaller and less valuable (I speak of
money) are not thus common. Why is this? In order that our life
might be disciplined, and that we might have training ground for
virtue. For if these necessaries were not common, perhaps they who
are rich, practising their usual covetousness, would strangle those
who were poor. For if they do this for the sake of money, much
rather would they do so for the things referred to. Again, if money
was also an universal possession, and were offered in the same
manner to all, the occasion for almsgiving, and the opportunity for
benevolence, would be taken away.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.iv-p55">20. That we may live then securely, the
sources of our existence have been made common. On the other hand,
to the end that we may have an opportunity of gaining crowns and
good report, property has not been made common; in order that
hating covetousness, and following after righteousness, and freely
bestowing our goods upon the poor, we may by this method obtain a
certain kind of relief for our sins.<note place="end" n="1110" id="xix.iv-p55.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iv-p56"> Plato de Legg. x. (not xi.) uses παραμυθίον not, as Stephanus takes it, for
“an expiation,” but “a means of persuasion;” the word used
here probably means relief.</p></note> God hath made thee rich, why
makest thou thyself poor? He hath made thee rich that thou mayest
assist the needy; that thou mayest have release of thine own sins,
by liberality to others. He hath given thee money, not that thou
mayest shut it up for thy destruction, but that thou mayest pour it
forth for thy salvation. For this reason also He hath made the
possession of riches uncertain and unstable, that by this means he
might slack the intensity of thy madness concerning it. For if its
possessors, even now whilst they can have no confidence in regard
to it, but behold a multitude of snares produced from this quarter,
are so inflamed with the desire of these things; if the elements of
security and stability were added to wealth, whom would they have
spared? From whom would they have refrained? From what widows? From
what orphans? From what poor?</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.iv-p57">21. Wherefore let us not consider riches to be
a great good; for the great good is, not to possess money, but to
possess the fear of God and all manner of piety. Behold, now if
there were any righteous man here, having great boldness toward
God,<note place="end" n="1111" id="xix.iv-p57.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iv-p58"> παῤῥησἴαν, as is said

notwithstanding he might be the poorest of mortals, he would be
sufficient to liberate us from present evils! For he only needed to
spread forth his hands towards heaven, and to call upon God, and
this cloud would pass away! But now gold is treasured up in
abundance; and yet it is more useless than mere clay for the
purpose of deliverance from the impending calamities! Nor is it
only in a peril of this kind; but should disease or death, or any
such evil befall us, the impotency of wealth is fully proved, since
it is at a loss, and has no consolation of its own to offer us
amidst these events.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.iv-p59">22. There is one thing in which wealth seems to have
an advantage over poverty, viz. that it lives in a state of daily
luxury, and is supplied with an abundance of pleasure in its
banquets. This however may also be seen exemplified at the table of
the poor; and these enjoy there a pleasure superior to that of the
rich. And marvel not at this, nor think what I say a paradox; for I
will make the matter clear to you from the evidence of facts. Ye
know of course, and ye all confess 
<pb n="352" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_352.html" id="xix.iv-Page_352" />that in feasts it is not the nature of the
viands, but the disposition of those who feast upon them, which
usually causes the pleasure; for instance, when any one comes to
the table hungry, the food will taste sweeter than any delicacy, or
condiment, or a thousand exquisite preparations for the palate,
although it may be the most common article of diet. But he who
without tarrying for necessity, or first waiting till he is hungry,
(as the custom is with the wealthy), when he comes to the table,
notwithstanding he finds the most refined dainties spread before
him, has no sensation of pleasure, his appetite not being
previously excited. And that you may learn that this is the actual
state of the case, besides that you are all witnesses to it, let us
hear the Scripture telling us the same truth; “The full soul,”
it is said, “loaths the honey comb, but to the hungry soul every
bitter thing is sweet.”<note place="end" n="1112" id="xix.iv-p59.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iv-p60"> <scripRef passage="Prov. xxvii. 7" id="xix.iv-p60.1" parsed="|Prov|27|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Prov.27.7">Prov.
xxvii. 7</scripRef>.</p></note> Yet what can be sweeter than
honey, and the honey comb? Still he saith it is not sweet to the
man that is not hungry. And what can be more disagreeable than
bitter things? And yet to those who are poverty stricken they are
sweet. But that the poor come to the meal with need and hunger, and
that the rich do not wait for this is manifest, I suppose, to every
one. Hence they do not reap the fruit of a genuine and unmixed
pleasure. Nor is it only in the article of food, but any one may
perceive that the same thing occurs with respect to drinks; and as
in the one case hunger is the cause of pleasure, far more than the
quality of the viands, so also in the other, thirst usually makes
the draught sweetest, although what is drunk is only water. And
this is that which the prophet intimated, when he said, “He
satisfied them with honey out of the rock.”<note place="end" n="1113" id="xix.iv-p60.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iv-p61"> <scripRef passage="Ps. lxxx. 16, lxxxi. 16" id="xix.iv-p61.1" parsed="|Ps|80|16|0|0;|Ps|81|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.80.16 Bible:Ps.81.16">Ps. lxxx.
16, lxxxi. 16</scripRef>, LXX.</p></note> But we do not read in any part of
Scripture that Moses brought honey out of the rock, but throughout
the history we read of rivers, and waters, and cool streams. What
then is it that was meant? For the Scripture by no means speaks
falsely. Inasmuch, then, as they were thirsty and wearied with
drought, and found these streams of water so cooling, in order to
show the pleasure of such a draught, he calls the water honey, not
as though its nature were changed into honey, but because the
condition of the drinkers made these streams sweeter than honey.
You see how the condition of the thirsty is wont to make the
draught sweet? Yea oftentimes have many of the poor, when wearied,
and distressed, and parched with thirst, partaken of such streams
even with such pleasure as I have said. But the rich, whilst
drinking wine that is sweet, and has the fragrance of flowers,<note place="end" n="1114" id="xix.iv-p61.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iv-p62"> ‡νθοσμίαν, Plutus, 807.</p></note> and every
perfection that wine can have, experience no such
enjoyment.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.iv-p63">23. The same thing happens as every one may
perceive with regard to sleep. For not a soft couch, nor a bedstead
overlaid with silver, nor the quietness that exists throughout the
house, nor anything else of this kind, are so generally wont to
make sleep sweet and pleasant, as labour and fatigue, and the need
of sleep, and drowsiness when one lies down. And to this particular
the experience of facts, nay, before actual experience, the
assertion of the Scriptures bears witness. For Solomon, who had
passed his life in luxury, when he wished to make this matter
evident, said, “The sleep of a labouring man is sweet, whether he
eat little or much?”<note place="end" n="1115" id="xix.iv-p63.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iv-p64"> <scripRef passage="Eccl. v. 12" id="xix.iv-p64.1" parsed="|Eccl|5|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Eccl.5.12">Eccl. v.
12</scripRef>.</p></note> Why does he add, “whether he eat
little or much?” Both these things usually bring sleeplessness,
viz. indigence, and excess of food; the one drying up the body,
stiffening the eyelids and not suffering them to be closed; the
other straitening and oppressing the breath, and inducing many
pains. But at the same time so powerful a persuasive is labour,
that though both these things should befall him, the servant is
able to sleep. For since throughout the whole day, they are running
about everywhere, ministering to their masters, being knocked
about<note place="end" n="1116" id="xix.iv-p64.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iv-p65"> κοπτόμενοι. Used
thus Dem. Ol. 2, as we say “knocked about,” not as Ben., <i>
vapulantes</i>.</p></note> and hard
pressed, and having but little time to take breath, they receive a
sufficient recompense for their toils and labours in the pleasure
of sleeping. And thus it hath happened through the goodness of God
toward man, that these pleasures are not to be purchased with gold
and silver, but with labour, with hard toil, with necessity, and
every kind of discipline. Not so the rich. On the contrary, whilst
lying on their beds, they are frequently without sleep through the
whole night; and though they devise many schemes, they do not
obtain such pleasure. But the poor man when released from his daily
labours, having his limbs completely tired, falls almost before he
can lie down into a slumber that is sound, and sweet, and genuine,
enjoying this reward, which is not a small one, of his fair day’s
toils. Since therefore the poor man sleeps, and drinks, and eats
with more pleasure than the rich man, what further value is left to
riches, now deprived of the one advantage they seemed to have over
poverty? For this reason also, from the beginning, God tied the man
to labour, not for the purpose of pun<pb n="353" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_353.html" id="xix.iv-Page_353" />ishing or chastising, but for
amendment and education. When Adam lived an unlabourious life, he
fell from Paradise, but when the Apostle laboured abundantly, and
toiled hard, and said, “In labour and travail, working night and
day,”<note place="end" n="1117" id="xix.iv-p65.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iv-p66"> <scripRef passage="1 Thess. ii. 9" id="xix.iv-p66.1" parsed="|1Thess|2|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Thess.2.9">1 Thess.
ii. 9</scripRef>.</p></note> then he
was taken up into Paradise, and ascended to the third
heaven!</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.iv-p67">24. Let us not then despise labour; let us not
despise work; for before the kingdom of Heaven, we receive the
greatest recompense from thence, deriving pleasure from that
circumstance; and not pleasure only, but what is greater than
pleasure, the purest health. For in addition to their want of
relish, many diseases also attack the rich; but the poor are freed
from the hands of physicians; and if at times they do fall into a
sickness, they recover themselves quickly, being far removed from
all effeminacy, and having robust constitutions. Poverty, to those
who bear it wisely, is a great possession, a treasure that cannot
be taken away; the stoutest of staves; a way of gain<note place="end" n="1118" id="xix.iv-p67.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iv-p68"> κτῆσις.</p></note> that
cannot be thwarted; a lodging that is safe from snares. The poor
man, it may be objected, is oppressed. But then the rich man is
still more subject to adverse designs. The poor man is looked down
upon and insulted. But the rich man is the subject of envy. The
poor man is not so easily assailed as the rich man, offering, as
the latter does on every side, countless handles to the devil, and
to his secret foes; and being the servant of all, on account of the
great extent of his business. Standing in need of many things, he
is compelled to flatter many persons, and to minister to them with
much servility. But the poor man, if he knows how to be spiritually
wise, is not assailable even by the devil himself. Job therefore,
strong as he was before this, when he lost all, became still more
powerful, and bore away an<note place="end" n="1119" id="xix.iv-p68.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iv-p69"> Sav. a more.</p></note> illustrious victory from the
devil!</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.iv-p70">25. But besides this, the poor man cannot possibly
be injured, if he knows how to be spiritually wise. Now what I said
of pleasure, that it consisted not in a costly provision of meats,
but in the disposition of those who eat, this also I say respecting
an insult; that the insult is either created or destroyed, not by
the intention of those who insult, but by the disposition of those
who bear it. For example. Some one hath insulted thee with much
language, fit or unfit to repeat. If thou shalt laugh at the
insults, if thou take not the words to heart, if thou showest
thyself superior to the blow, thou art not insulted. And just as if
we possessed an adamantine body, we should not be hurt, were we
even attacked on all sides by a thousand darts, for darts beget
wounds not from the hand of him who hurls them, but from the bodies
of those who receive them, so too in this case, insults are
constituted real and dishonourable ones, not from the folly of
those who offer them, but from the weakness of the insulted. For if
we know how to be truly wise, we are incapable of being insulted,
or of suffering any serious evils. Some one it may be hath offered
thee an insult, but thou hast not felt it? thou hast not been
pained. Then thou art not insulted, but hast given rather than
received a blow! For when the insulting person perceives that his
blow did not reach the soul of those who were reviled, he is
himself the more severely fretted; and whilst those who are
reproached remain silent, the insulting blow is turned backwards,
and recoils of its own accord upon him who aimed it.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.iv-p71">26. In all things then, beloved, let us be
spiritually wise, and poverty will be able to do us no harm, but
will benefit us exceedingly, and render us more illustrious and
wealthy than the richest. For tell me who was poorer than Elias?
Yet for this reason he surpassed all the wealthy, in that he was so
poor, and this very poverty of his was his own choice from an
opulence of mind. For since he accounted the wealth of all riches
to be beneath his magnanimity, and not worthy of his spiritual
wisdom, therefore he welcomed this kind of poverty; so that if he
had considered present things as of much worth, he would not have
possessed only a mantle. But so did he contemn the vanity of the
life that now is, and regard all gold as clay cast into the
street,<note place="end" n="1120" id="xix.iv-p71.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iv-p72"> Comp. <scripRef passage="Ps. xviii. 42" id="xix.iv-p72.1" parsed="|Ps|18|42|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.18.42">Ps.

possessed himself of nothing more than that covering. Therefore the
king had need of the poor man, and he who had so much gold hung
upon the words of him who had nothing more than a sheepskin. Thus

the cave of the just man than the halls of kings. Therefore also
when he went up to heaven, he left nothing to his disciple save the
sheepskin. “By the help of this,” said he, “I have wrestled
with the devil, and taking this, be thou armed against him!” For
indigence is a powerful weapon, an unassailable retreat, an
unshaken fortress! Elisha received the sheepskin as the greatest
inheritance; for it was truly such; a more precious one than all
gold. And thenceforth<note place="end" n="1122" id="xix.iv-p73.3"><p class="endnote" id="xix.iv-p74"> Sav. ἐκ τότε.</p></note> that Elias was a twofold person;

not then be cast down. Let us not lament, nor fear the difficulty

full possession of the see at the death of Meletius, to whom many
of the orthodox had adhered. Hence Flavianus was not acknowledged

rejoice that he hath set out on a journey for our preservation;
that he is gone to snatch so great a multitude from the wrath of
the Emperor! Here is both an ornament to you, and a crown to him!
An ornament to you, that such a father hath been allotted to you; a
crown to him, because he is so affectionate towards his children,
and hath confirmed by actual deeds what Christ said. For having
learnt that “the good shepherd layeth down his life for the
sheep,”<note place="end" n="1126" id="xix.v-p4.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.v-p5"> <scripRef passage="John x. 11" id="xix.v-p5.1" parsed="|John|10|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.10.11">John x.

his departure; venturing his own life for us all, notwithstanding
there were many things to hinder his absence, and enforce his stay.
And first, his time of life, extended as it is to the utmost limits
of old age; next, his bodily infirmity, and the season of the year,
as well as the necessity for his presence at the holy festival; and
besides these reasons, his only sister even now at her last breath!
He has disregarded, however, the ties of kindred, of old age, of
infirmity, and the severity of the season, and the toils of the
journey; and preferring you and your safety above all things, he
has broken through all these restraints. And, even as a youth, the
aged man is now hastening along, borne upon the wings of zeal! For
if Christ (saith he) gave Himself for us, what excuse or pardon
should we deserve, having undertaken the charge of so numerous a
people, if we were not ready to do and to suffer anything for the
security of those committed into our hands. For if (continues he)
the patriarch Jacob, when in charge of flocks, and feeding brute
sheep, and having to give account to man, passed sleepless nights,
and bore heat and <pb n="355" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_355.html" id="xix.v-Page_355" />cold,
and all the inclemency of the elements, to the end that not one of
those animals might perish, much less doth it become us, who
preside over those, who are not irrational, but spiritual sheep;
who are about to give an account of this charge, not to man, but to
God, to be slack in any respect, or shrink from anything which
might benefit the flock. Besides, in proportion as the latter flock
is superior to the former; men to brutes, and God to men; so it
behoves us to manifest a greater and more intense anxiety and
diligence. He knows well that his concern is now, not for one city
only, but for the whole of the East. For our city is the head and
mother of all that lie towards the East. For this reason he would
encounter every danger, and nothing would avail to detain him
here.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.v-p6">2. On this account I trust that there may be a
good hope; for God will not disdain to look upon such earnestness
and zeal, nor will He suffer his servant to return without success.
I know that when he has barely seen our pious Emperor, and been
seen by him, he will be able at once by his very countenance to
allay his wrath. For not only the words of the saints, but their
very countenances are full of grace. And he is a person too endowed
with abundant wisdom; and being well skilled in the divine laws, he
will say to him as Moses said to God, “Yet now, if thou wilt
forgive their sin;—and if not, slay me together with them.”<note place="end" n="1127" id="xix.v-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.v-p7"> <scripRef passage="Ex. xxxii. 31, 32" id="xix.v-p7.1" parsed="|Exod|32|31|32|32" osisRef="Bible:Exod.32.31-Exod.32.32">Ex.

are the bowels of the saints, that they think death with their
children sweeter than life without them. He will also make the
special season his advocate and shelter himself behind the sacred
festival of the Passover; and will remind the Emperor of the season
when Christ remitted the sins of the whole world. He will exhort
him to imitate his Lord. He will also remind him of that parable of
the ten thousand talents, and the hundred pence. I know the
boldness of our father, that he will not hesitate to alarm him from
the parable, and to say, “Take heed lest thou also hear it said
in that day, ‘O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that
debt, because thou desirest me; you ought also to forgive thy
fellow-servants!’<note place="end" n="1128" id="xix.v-p7.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.v-p8"> <scripRef passage="Matt. xviii. 32, 33" id="xix.v-p8.1" parsed="|Matt|18|32|18|33" osisRef="Bible:Matt.18.32-Matt.18.33">Matt.

benefit than them, since by pardoning these few offences thou
gainest an amnesty for greater.” To this address he will add that
prayer, which those who initiated him into the sacred mystery
taught him to offer up, and say, “Forgive us our debts, as we
forgive our debtors.”<note place="end" n="1129" id="xix.v-p8.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.v-p9"> <scripRef passage="Matt. vi. 12" id="xix.v-p9.1" parsed="|Matt|6|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.6.12">Matt. vi.

Lord’s Prayer was at this period confined to those who were
initiated or baptized. St. Chrysostom calls it the prayer of the
faithful, and others of the Fathers speak in a similar manner. See

<p class="c10" id="xix.v-p10">3. He will moreover inform him, that the
offence was not common to the whole city, but the deed of certain
strangers and adventurers, men that act upon no deliberate plan,
but with every sort of audacity and lawlessness; and that it would
not be just for the disorderly conduct of a few to extirpate so
great a city, and to punish those who had done no wrong; and that
even though all had been transgressors, they had paid a sufficient
punishment, being consumed by fear so many days, and expecting
every day to be put to death, and being exiles and fugitives; thus
living more wretchedly than condemned criminals, carrying their
life in their hands, and having no confidence of escape! “Let
this punishment (he will say) suffice. Carry not thy resentment
further! Make the Judge above merciful to thyself, by humanity
towards thy fellow-servants! Think of the greatness of the city,
and that the question now is not concerning one, or two, or three,
or ten souls, but of a vast multitude too numerous to be reckoned
up! It is a question which affects the capital of the whole world.
This is the city in which Christians were first called by that
name.<note place="end" n="1130" id="xix.v-p10.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.v-p11"> <scripRef passage="Acts xi. 26" id="xix.v-p11.1" parsed="|Acts|11|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.11.26">Acts xi.

the people of Antioch being notorious for the invention of
scurrilous nick-names.</p></note> Honor
Christ. Reverence the city which first proclaimed that name, so
lovely and sweet to all! This city hath been the tabernacle of
Apostles; the dwelling place of the just! And now this is the first
and only instance of insurrection against its rulers; and all past
time will bear favourable witness to the manners of the city. For
had the people been continually given to sedition, it might have
been necessary to make an example of such iniquity; but if this
hath happened only once in all time, it is plain that the offence
has not arisen from the habit of the city, but that it was the
transgression of those who had in an evil hour by mere random
chance arrived there.”</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.v-p12">4. These things and more than these the priest will
say with still greater boldness; and the Emperor will listen to
them; and one is humane, and the other is faithful; so that on both
sides we entertain favourable hopes. But much more do we rely upon
the mercy of God, than upon the fidelity of our Teacher and the
humanity of the Emperor. For whilst the Emperor is supplicated, and
the priest is supplicating, He Himself will interpose, softening
the heart of the Emperor, and exciting the tongue of the priest;
facilitating <pb n="356" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_356.html" id="xix.v-Page_356" />his
utterance;—preparing the mind of the other to receive what is
said and with much indulgence, to accede to the petitions. For our
city is dearer to Christ than all others both because of the virtue
of our ancestors, and of your own. And as Peter was the first among
the apostles to preach Christ, so as I said before, this city was
the first of cities that adorned itself by assuming the Christian
appellation, as a sort of admirable diadem. But if where only ten
just men were found, God promised to save all who dwelt therein,
why should we not expect a favourable issue, and become assured of
all our lives, when there are not only ten, twenty, or twice so
many only, but far more; who are serving God with all
strictness.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.v-p13">5. I have heard many saying, “The threats of

lamentation. What then should we say to such? That He who said,

able to convert the lion into a mild lamb. Let us therefore
supplicate Him; let us send an embassy to Him; and He will
doubtless allay the Emperor’s wrath, and deliver us from the
impending distress. Our Father hath gone thither on this embassy.
Let us go on embassy from hence to the Majesty of heaven! Let us
assist him by prayers! The community of the Church can do much, if
with a sorrowful soul, and with a contrite spirit, we offer up our
prayers! It is unnecessary to cross the ocean, or to undertake a
long journey. Let every man and woman among us, whether meeting
together at church, or remaining at home, call upon God with much
earnestness, and He will doubtless accede to these
petitions.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.v-p16">Whence does this appear evident? Because He is
exceedingly desirous, that we should always take refuge in Him, and
in everything make our requests unto Him; and do nothing and speak
nothing without Him. For men, when we trouble them repeatedly
concerning our affairs, become slothful and evasive, and conduct
themselves unpleasantly towards us; but with God it is quite the
reverse. Not when we apply to him continually respecting our
affairs, but when we fail to do so, then is he especially
displeased. Hear at least what He reproves the Jews for, when He
says, “Ye have taken counsel, but not of Me, and made treaties,<note place="end" n="1133" id="xix.v-p16.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.v-p17"> So LXX. E.V., <i>cover with a covering</i>,

is the custom of those who love; they desire that all the concerns
of their beloved should be accomplished by means of themselves; and
that they should neither do anything, nor say anything, without
them. On this account did God not only on that occasion, but again
elsewhere, uttering a reproof, speak the same language. “They<note place="end" n="1135" id="xix.v-p18.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.v-p19"> So LXX. E.V., <i>They have set up kings, but

then be slow to take refuge in Him continually; and whatever be the
evil, it will in any case find its appropriate solution.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.v-p21">6. Doth a man affright you? Hasten to the Lord
above, and thou wilt suffer no evil. Thus the ancients had release
from their calamities; and not men only, but also women. There was
a certain Hebrew woman, Esther was her name. This Esther rescued
the whole people of the Jews, when they were about to be delivered
over to destruction, by this very method. For when the Persian king
gave orders that all the Jews should be utterly destroyed, and
there was no one who was able to stand in the way of his
wrath,—this woman having divested herself of the splendid robe,
and clothed herself with sackcloth and being besprinkled with
ashes, supplicated the merciful God to go in with her to the king;
and offering up her prayer to Him, these were the words she
uttered, “O Lord, make my words acceptable,<note place="end" n="1137" id="xix.v-p21.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.v-p22"> This clause is not in our text.</p></note> and put eloquent speech in my

Esther, in the Apocrypha, ch. xiv. 2, 3, 13</scripRef>.</p></note> Let this
be the prayer which we offer to God for our Teacher. For if a
woman, supplicating on behalf of the Jews, prevailed to allay the
wrath of a barbarian, much rather will our Teacher, entreating on
behalf of so great a city, and in conjunction with so great a
Church, be able to persuade this most mild and merciful Emperor.
For if he hath received authority to loose sins committed against
God, much more will he be able to take away and blot out those
which have been committed against a man. He is also himself a ruler
and a ruler of more dignity than the other. For the sacred laws
take and place under his hands even the royal head. And when there
is need of any good thing from above, the Emperor is accustomed to
fly to the priest: but not the priest to the Emperor. He<note place="end" n="1139" id="xix.v-p23.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.v-p24"> Sav. and M. om. For.</p></note> too hath

let us pray; let us make invocation; let us supplicate; let us go
on embassy to the King that is above with many tears! We have this
fast too as an ally, and as an assistant in this good intercession.
Therefore, as when the winter is over and the summer is appearing,
the sailor draws his vessel to the deep; and the soldier burnishes
his arms, and makes ready his steed for the battle; and the
husbandman sharpens his sickle; and the traveller boldly undertakes
a long journey, and the wrestler strips and bares himself for the
contest. So too, when the fast makes its appearance, like a kind of
spiritual summer, let us as soldiers burnish our weapons; and as
husbandmen let us sharpen our sickle; and as sailors let us order
our thoughts against the waves of extravagant desires; and as
travellers let us set out on the journey towards heaven; and as
wrestlers let us strip for the contest. For the believer is at once
a husbandman, and a sailor, and a soldier, a wrestler, and a
traveller. Hence St. Paul saith, “We wrestle not against flesh
and blood, but against principalities, against powers. Put on
therefore the whole armour of God.”<note place="end" n="1144" id="xix.v-p29.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.v-p30"> <scripRef passage="Eph. vi. 12" id="xix.v-p30.1" parsed="|Eph|6|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Eph.6.12">Eph. vi.

Hast thou observed the soldier? If thou art a wrestler, it is
necessary for thee to engage in the conflict naked. If a soldier,
it behoves thee to stand in the battle line armed at all points.
How then are both these things possible, to be naked, and yet not
naked; to be clothed, and yet not clothed! How? I will tell thee.
Divest thyself of worldly business, and thou hast become a
wrestler. Put on the spiritual armour, and thou hast become a
soldier. Strip thyself of worldly cares, for the season is one of
wrestling. Clothe thyself with the spiritual armour, for we have a
heavy warfare to wage with demons. Therefore also it is needful we
should be naked, so as to offer nothing that the devil may take
hold of, while he is wrestling with us; and to be fully armed at
all points, so as on no side to receive a deadly blow. Cultivate
thy soul. Cut away the thorns. Sow the word of godliness. Propagate
and nurse with much care the fair plants of divine wisdom, and thou
hast become a husbandman. And Paul will say to thee, “The

persons keep, but of real fasting; not merely an abstinence from
meats; but from sins too. For the nature of a fast is such, that it

the danger in fasting is so great to those who do not know how they
ought to fast, we should learn the laws of this exercise, in order
that we may not “run uncertainly,” nor “beat the air,” nor
while we are fighting contend with a shadow. Fasting is a medicine;
but a medicine, though it be never so profitable, becomes
frequently useless owing to the unskilfulness of him who employs
it. For it is necessary to know, moreover, the time when it should
be applied, and the requisite quantity of it; and the temperament
of body that admits it; and the nature of the country, and the
season of the year; and the corresponding diet; as well as various
other particulars; any of which, if one overlooks, he will mar all
the rest that have been named. Now if, when the body needs healing,
such exactness is required on our part, much more ought we, when
our care is about the soul, and we seek to heal the distempers of
the mind, to look, and to search into every particular with the
utmost accuracy.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.v-p39">9. Let us see then how the Ninevites fasted,
and how they were delivered from that wrath—“Let neither man
nor beast, herd nor flock, taste anything,”<note place="end" n="1152" id="xix.v-p39.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.v-p40"> <scripRef passage="Jonah iii. 7" id="xix.v-p40.1" parsed="|Jonah|3|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Jonah.3.7">Jonah
iii. 7</scripRef>.</p></note> saith (the prophet). What sayest
thou? Tell me—must even the irrational things fast, and the
horses and the mules be covered with sackcloth? “Even so,” he
replies. For as when, at the decease of some rich man, the
relatives clothe not only the men servants and maid servants, but
the horses also with sackcloth, and give orders that they should
follow the procession to the sepulchre, led by their grooms; thus
signifying the greatness of the calamity, and inviting all to pity;
thus also, indeed, when that city was about to be destroyed, even
the irrational nature was enveloped in sackcloth, and subjected to
the yoke of fasting. “It is not possible,” saith he, “that
irrational creatures should learn the wrath of God by means of
reason; let them be taught by means of fasting, that this stroke is
of divine infliction. For if the city should be overturned, not
only would it be one common sepulchre for us, the dwellers therein,
but for these likewise. Inasmuch then as these would participate in
the punishment, let them also do so in the fast.” But there was
yet another thing which they aimed at in this act, which the
prophets also are wont to do. For these, when they see some
dreadful chastisement proceeding from heaven, and those who are to
be punished without anything to say for themselves;—laden with
shame,—unworthy of the least pardon or excuse:—not knowing what
to do, nor from whence they may procure an advocacy for the
condemned, they have recourse to the things irrational; and
describing their death in tragical fashion, they make intercession
by them, putting forward as a plea their pitiable and mournful
destruction. When therefore, aforetime, famine had seized upon the
Jews, and a great drought oppressed their country, and all things
were being consumed, one of the prophets spoke thus, “The young
heifers leaped in their stalls; the herds of oxen wept, because
there was no pasture; all the cattle of the field looked upward to
Thee, because the streams of waters were dried up.”<note place="end" n="1153" id="xix.v-p40.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.v-p41"> <scripRef passage="Joel i. 17" id="xix.v-p41.1" parsed="|Joel|1|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Joel.1.17">Joel i.

vol. vi. p. 456, b. xxi., c. 1, sec. 5. This Homily seems to have
been preached on Quinquagesima Sunday, called by the Greeks, κυριακὴ τῆς ‡ποκρ™ου [Lat. <i>

call so immature an age to supplication? Is it not plainly for the

provoked.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.v-p44">10. But, as I said before, we may see what it
was that dissolved such inexorable wrath. Was it, forsooth, fasting
only and sackcloth? We say not so; but the change of their whole
life. Whence does this appear? From the very language of the
prophet. For he who hath discoursed of the wrath of God, and of
their fasting,<note place="end" n="1156" id="xix.v-p44.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.v-p45"> διὰ τὴν νηστείαν, with
the article it is “the Fast,” or here Lent, without it
“fasting.”</p></note> himself
too, when speaking of the reconciliation, and teaching us the cause
of the reconciliation, speaks to this effect; “And God saw their
works.”<note place="end" n="1157" id="xix.v-p45.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.v-p46"> <scripRef passage="Jonah iii. 10" id="xix.v-p46.1" parsed="|Jonah|3|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Jonah.3.10">Jonah

of <pb n="359" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_359.html" id="xix.v-Page_359" />works? That they had
fasted? That they had put on sackcloth? Nothing of the sort: but
passing all these points in silence, he adds, “That they turned
every one from their evil ways, and the Lord repented of the evil
that He had said He would do unto them.” Seest thou, that fasting
did not rescue from this danger, but it was the change of life,
which rendered God propitious and kind to these barbarians?</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.v-p47">11. I have said these things, not that we may
disparage fasting, but that we may honour fasting; for the honour
of fasting consists not in abstinence from food, but in withdrawing
from sinful practices; since he who limits his fasting only to an
abstinence from meats, is one who especially disparages it. Dost
thou fast? Give me proof of it by thy works! Is it said by what
kind of works? If thou seest a poor man, take pity on him! If thou
seest in enemy, be reconciled to him! If thou seest a friend
gaining honour, envy him not! If thou seest a handsome woman, pass
her by! For let not the mouth only fast, but also the eye, and the
ear, and the feet, and the hands, and all the members of our
bodies. Let the hands fast, by being pure from rapine and avarice.
Let the feet fast, by ceasing from running to the unlawful
spectacles. Let the eyes fast, being taught never<note place="end" n="1158" id="xix.v-p47.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.v-p48"> μηδ™ποτε. This shows he
did not mean only a temporary abstinence from sin, but a discipline
to cure us of it for the future.</p></note> to fix
themselves rudely upon handsome countenances, or to busy themselves
with strange beauties. For looking is the food of the eyes, but if
this be such as is unlawful or forbidden, it mars the fast; and
upsets the whole safety of the soul; but if it be lawful and safe,
it adorns fasting. For it would be among things the most absurd to
abstain from lawful food because of the fast, but with the eyes to
touch even what is forbidden. Dost thou not eat flesh? Feed not
upon lasciviousness by means of the eyes. Let the ear fast also.
The fasting of the ear consists in refusing to receive evil
speakings and calumnies. “Thou shalt not receive a false

struck at the common welfare of the Church; for all those who hear
not only accuse the supposed sinner, but the reproach is fastened
on the Christian community; neither dost thou hear the unbelievers
saying, “Such a person is a fornicator, or a libertine;” but
instead of the individual who hath sinned, they accuse all
Christians. In addition to this,<note place="end" n="1164" id="xix.v-p54.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.v-p55"> 3rd reason.</p></note> thou hast caused the glory of God
to be blasphemed; for as His Name is glorified when we have good
report, so when we sin, it is blasphemed and insulted!</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.v-p56">13. A fourth reason is, that thou hast
disgraced him who is ill reported; and hast thus rendered him more
shameless than he was, by placing him in a state of enmity and
hostility. Fifthly, thou hast made thyself liable to chastisement
and vengeance; by involving<note place="end" n="1165" id="xix.v-p56.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.v-p57"> πρ€γματα πλ™ξας.</p></note> thyself in matters which in no way
concerned thee. For let not any one tell me in reply, “Then I am
an evil speaker when I speak falsely, but if I speak what is true,
I cease to be so.” Although it be with truth thou speakest evil,
this also is a crime. For that Pharisee spake evil of the Publican
with truth; but nevertheless this availed him not. For was not the
latter, I ask, a publican and a sinner? It is manifest to every one
that he was a publican. But at the same time inasmuch as the
Pharisee spoke ill of him, he departed from the temple with the
loss of every advantage. Dost thou wish to correct a brother? Weep;
pray unto God; taking him apart, admonish, counsel, entreat him! So
also Paul did, “Lest,” saith he, “when I come again, my God
will humble me among you, and I shall bewail many which have sinned
already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication
and lasciviousness which they have committed.”<note place="end" n="1166" id="xix.v-p57.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.v-p58"> <scripRef passage="2 Cor. xii. 21" id="xix.v-p58.1" parsed="|2Cor|12|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.12.21">2 Cor.

such a one is a bad man? The greatest injury indeed results from
this, and the worst loss!” Say to him, “Let us be anxious about
our own faults; how we may render up an account of our own
transgressions; and exhibit this sort of curiosity and meddlesome
activity respecting our own lives. What excuse or pardon shall we

but thus inquisitively pry into those of others!” And as it is
mean and extremely disgraceful to peer into a house, and to observe
what is within as one passes, so also to make inquisition into
another man’s life is the last degree of illiberality. But what
is yet more ridiculous is, that those who lead this sort of life,
and are neglectful of their own affairs, when they have mentioned
any of these secret matters, beseech and adjure him who has heard
it, not to mention it more to any other person; thus making it
plain that they have done an action which deserves censure. For if
thou beseechest him to tell this to no other person, much more did

the meaning of this? “let it die with thee?” Extinguish it;
bury it; neither permit it to go forth, nor even to move at all;
but, as the best course, be careful not to tolerate others in the
practice of evil speaking. And should you perchance, at any time
receive an impression from it, bury it, destroy what has been
uttered, deliver it over to oblivion; in order that you may become
like those who have not heard it; and spend the present life with
much peace and security. Should the slanderers learn that we abhor
them more than those do whom they accuse, they themselves will
henceforth abandon this evil habit, and correct the sin; and will
afterwards applaud, and proclaim us as those who were their
saviours and benefactors. For, as to speak well, and to applaud, is
the beginning of friendship, so to speak ill and to calumniate, has
been the beginning and foundation of enmity, and hatred, and a
thousand quarrels. From nothing else have our own affairs been more
neglected, than from the habit of prying into and meddling with the
concerns of others; for it is not possible for one who is given to
evil speaking, and busying himself with other men’s lives, ever
to look after his own life. His whole study being expended upon
meddling with other men’s matters, all those which belong to
himself must of necessity be left at hazard and neglected. For it
is well if one who spends all his leisure on the anxious
consideration of his own sins, and the judgment of them, can make
any progress. But when thou art always busy about other men’s
matters, when wilt thou pay any heed to thy own evils?</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.v-p67">16. Let us flee then, beloved, let us flee slander!
knowing that it is the very gulph of Satan, and the place where he
lurks with his snares. For in order that we may be careless of our
own state, and may thus render 
<pb n="361" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_361.html" id="xix.v-Page_361" />our account heavier, the devil leads us
into this custom. But more than this it is not only a very serious
matter, that we shall hereafter have to give account of what we
have spoken, but that we shall make our own offences the heavier by
these means; depriving ourselves of all excuse. For he who scans
with bitterness the conduct of others, can never obtain pardon for
the sins committed by himself. For God will determine the sentence,
not only from the nature of our transgressions, but from the
judgment which thou hast passed upon others. Therefore He gave the
admonition, “Judge not, that ye be not judged.”<note place="end" n="1173" id="xix.v-p67.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.v-p68"> <scripRef passage="Matt. vii. 1" id="xix.v-p68.1" parsed="|Matt|7|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.7.1">Matt.

sin, of whatever kind, will not there appear any more such as it
was when committed, but will receive a great and unpardonable
addition from the judgment passed by thee upon thy fellow servants.
For as he who is humane, and merciful, and forgiving, cuts away the
greater mass of his sins, so he who is bitter, and cruel, and
implacable, greatly increases the magnitude of his own offences.
Let us then expel from our mouth all slander, knowing that if we do
not abstain from it, though we might feed upon ashes, this
austerity would avail us nothing. “For not that which entereth
into, but that which cometh out of the mouth defileth the man.”<note place="end" n="1174" id="xix.v-p68.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.v-p69"> <scripRef passage="Matt. xv. 17, 18" id="xix.v-p69.1" parsed="|Matt|15|17|15|18" osisRef="Bible:Matt.15.17-Matt.15.18">Matt. xv.

were to stir up a cesspool, when you were passing, say, would you
not reproach and rate the man who did it? This then also do with
respect to the slanderer. For the stirred cesspool does not so
grossly offend the sense of those who smell that ill savour, as the
stirring up other men’s sins, and the exposure of an impure life,
offends and disturbs the soul of those who hear of it. Therefore
let us abstain from evil speaking, from foul language, from
blasphemy; and let us not speak ill of our neighbour, nor of
God!</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.v-p70">17. For many of our evil speakers have run
into such madness, as to lift up their own tongue from their fellow
servants against their Master. But how great an evil this is, you
may learn from the affairs in which we are now involved. A man is
insulted, and, lo! we are all fearing and trembling, both those who
were guilty of the insult, and those who are conscious of nothing
of the kind! But God is insulted every day! Why do I say every
day?—every hour rather, by the rich, by the poor, by those who
are at ease, by the afflicted, by those who calumniate, and those
who are calumniated, and yet no one ever hears a word of this!
Therefore He has permitted our fellow servant<note place="end" n="1175" id="xix.v-p70.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.v-p71"> The Emperor.</p></note> to be insulted, in order that from
the danger which has happened through this insult, thou mayest
learn the benignity of the Lord! And notwithstanding that this is
our first and only offence, we do not on that account expect to
gain an excuse, or pardon. But we provoke God every day, and we
show no signs of returning to Him, and yet He endures it with all
long-suffering! Seest thou then how great the benignity of the Lord
is? Yet, in this present outrage, those who had done amiss were
taken and thrust into prison, and paid the penalty; nevertheless we
are still in fear, for he who has been insulted has not as yet
heard<note place="end" n="1176" id="xix.v-p71.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.v-p72"> The two capitals of Antioch and Constantinople

taken place, nor pronounced sentence, and we are all trembling. But
God every day hears of the insults offered Him, and no one heeds
it, although God is thus merciful and loving toward man. With Him
it suffices only to acknowledge the sin, and so to cancel the
accusation. But with man it is altogether the reverse. When those
who have sinned confess, then they are punished the more; which
indeed has happened in the present instance. And some have perished
by the sword, some by fire; some given to wild beasts, and not men
only, but children. And neither this immaturity of age, nor the

just as when men beholding from the land those who are shipwrecked,

once in all his lifetime has experienced this; and then it was not
done to his face; nor while he was present to see or hear it; and
nevertheless, none of those who perpetrated these deeds obtained
pardon. But with regard to God nothing of the kind can be said; for
the interval between man and God, is so great, as no language can
at all express; and throughout every day He is insulted, although
present, and seeing and hearing it: and yet He sends not forth the
lightning, nor commands the sea to overflow the land, and submerge
all men; nor does He bid the earth to cleave asunder and swallow up
all the contumelious; but He forbears, and suffers long, and still
offers to pardon those who have insulted Him, if they only repent
and promise to do these things no more! Truly now is the season to
proclaim, “Who can utter the mighty acts of the Lord? who can
show forth all His praise?”<note place="end" n="1181" id="xix.v-p77.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.v-p78"> <scripRef passage="Ps. cvi. 2" id="xix.v-p78.1" parsed="|Ps|6|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.6.2">Ps. cvi.

have been called His image; and it were fitting they should receive
honour on account of the appellation. But thou for the sake of a
little gold dost trample them under foot, dost throttle them, and
drag them away; and hast not to this day in any wise paid the
penalty!</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.v-p82">19. May there be then speedily some favourable
and propitious change! This certainly I foretell and testify, that
although this cloud should pass away, and we yet remain in the same
condition of listlessness, we shall again have to suffer much
heavier evils than those we are now dreading; for I do not so much
fear the wrath of the Emperor, as your own listlessness. Surely it
is not sufficient by way of apology that we supplicate<note place="end" n="1185" id="xix.v-p82.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.v-p83"> λιτανεῦσαι.</p></note> two or
three days, but it is necessary that we should make a change in our
whole life,<note place="end" n="1186" id="xix.v-p83.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.v-p84"> Sav. and M. “the change that of our whole
life:” the Greek reads best so.</p></note> and that
whilst abstaining from wickedness we should persevere continually
in virtue. For as those who are sickly, unless they keep up a
constant regimen, would find no advantage by their observing a two
or three days’ discipline; so those who are in sin, if they do
not exercise sobriety at all times, will find no benefit in two or
three days’ amendment. For as it is said, that he who is washed,
and is again afterwards polluted with the mire, hath gained
nothing; so he who has repented for three days, and has again
returned to his former state, has accomplished nothing. Let us not
therefore, now act as we have always done hitherto. For many times,
when we have been surprised by earthquakes, as well as famine and
drought, after becoming more sober and gentle for three or four
days, we did but return again to the former course. For this cause
our present troubles have happened. But if we have not done so
before; yet, now at least let us all persevere in the same piety;
let us preserve the same meekness, that we may not again need
another stroke. Was not God able to have prevented what has taken
place? He did, however, permit it, that He might make those who
despised Him more sober-minded, through dread of a
fellow-servant!</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.v-p85">20. But let not any one say that many of the
guilty escaped, and that many of the innocent incurred punishment.
For I hear of numerous persons who frequently say this; not only in
the case of the present sedition, but also in many other
circumstances of this nature. What then should I reply to those who
make such observations? Why, that if he who was captured was
innocent of the present sedition, he had wrought some other
transgression before this still more grievous, for which, not
having afterwards repented, he has paid the penalty at the present
time. For thus is the custom of God to deal with us. When we sin,
He does not straightway visit the transgression, but lets it pass,
giving us space<note place="end" n="1187" id="xix.v-p85.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.v-p86"> προθεσμίαν.</p></note> for
repentance, in order that we may be amended and converted. But if,
because we have not paid the penalty, we suppose that the offence
too is blotted out, and make light of it; then somewhere,
where <pb n="363" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_363.html" id="xix.v-Page_363" />we think not
of it, we are sure afterwards to be punished. And this takes place
in order that, when we sin and are not punished, we may not be free
from fear, unless we amend, knowing that we shall certainly fall
into punishment where we do not expect it. So that if thou sinnest,
beloved, and art not punished, do not grow presumptuous, but for
this very cause be the more alarmed, knowing that it is an easy
matter with God to recompense again when he pleases. For this
reason then he hath not punished thee, that thou mightest receive
space for repentance. Let us not therefore say, that such a person
whilst innocent incurred punishment; and another whilst guilty
escaped, for he who incurred it, being guiltless, as I observed,
paid the punishment of other transgressions; and he who now escapes
it, if he repents not, will be captured in another snare. If our
minds are thus disposed, we shall never forget our own sins, but,
always fearful and trembling lest we should have to pay the
penalty, we shall readily recollect them. For nothing is so apt to
bring sin to remembrance as punishment and chastisement. And this
is shown by Joseph’s brethren. For when they had sold the just
man, and thirteen years had passed away, suspecting they had fallen
into punishment, and fearing for their lives, they remembered their
sin, and said one to another, “We are verily guilty concerning
our brother Joseph.”<note place="end" n="1188" id="xix.v-p86.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.v-p87"> <scripRef passage="Gen. xlii. 21" id="xix.v-p87.1" parsed="|Gen|42|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.42.21">Gen.
xlii. 21</scripRef>.</p></note> Seest thou, how fear brought their
guilt to recollection? And yet when they were sinning they
perceived it not, but when they were fearful of being punished,
then they remembered it? Knowing, therefore, all these things, let
us make a change and amendment of our lives; and let us think of
religion and virtue, before we think of deliverance from the
impending distress.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.v-p88">21. And in the meanwhile I desire to fix three
precepts in your mind, to the end that you may accomplish me these
during the fast,—viz. to speak ill of no one; to hold no one for
an enemy; and to expel from the mouth altogether the evil custom of
oaths. And as when we hear that some money tax is imposed, each one
going within, and calling his wife and children and servants,
considers and consults with them how he may pay this tribute, so
also let us do with respect to these spiritual precepts. Let every
one when he has returned home call together his wife and children,
and let him say, that a spiritual tribute was imposed this day: a
tribute by which there will be some deliverance and removal of
these evils; a tribute which does not make those who pay it poor,
but richer; that is to say, to have no enemy, to speak evil of no
man, and to swear not at all. Let us consider; let us think; let us
resolve how we may fulfill these precepts. Let us exert every
endeavour. Let us admonish each other. Let us correct each other,
that we may not go to the other world as debtors, and then, needing
to borrow of others, suffer the fate of the foolish virgins, and
fall from immortal salvation. If we thus set our lives in order, I
warrant you and promise, that from this there will be deliverance
from the present calamity, and a removal of these dreadful ills;
and what is greater than all, there will be the enjoyment of the
good things to come. For it were fitting that I should commit to
you the whole body of virtue; but I think it the best method of
correction, to take the laws by parts, and reduce them to practice,
and then to proceed to others. For as in a given field, the
husbandman, digging it all up piecemeal, gradually comes to the end
of his task; so we too if we make this rule for ourselves, in any
wise to reduce to a correct practice these three precepts during
the present Lent, and to commit them to the safe custody of good
habit, we shall proceed with greater ease to the rest; and by this
means arriving at the summit of spiritual wisdom, we shall both
reap the fruit of a favourable hope in the present life; and in the
life to come we shall stand before Christ with great confidence,
and enjoy those unspeakable blessings; which, God grant, we may all
be found worthy of, through the grace and loving kindness of Jesus
Christ our Lord, with Whom be glory to the Father and the Holy
Spirit forever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p class="c38" id="xix.vi-p2">An exhortation to the people respecting fortitude
and patience, from the examples of Job and the Three Children in

abstaining from oaths.</p>

<p class="c9" id="xix.vi-p3">1. <span class="c12" id="xix.vi-p3.1">Blessed</span> be God! who
hath comforted your sorrowing souls, and stayed your agitated
spirits! For that ye have received no small consolation is evident
by the desire and readiness to listen which ye are now showing. For
it is impossible that a soul in anguish, and oppressed with the
cloud of despondency, should have power to hear with readiness
anything that is spoken. But I see you are attending to us with
much good will, and with an intense earnestness; and that you have
shaken off gloomy thoughts, and put aside the sense of present
distress, in your affectionate desire of listening. For this cause,
I thank God heartily together with you, that the calamity has not
overmatched your philosophy; nor fear relaxed your vigour; nor
tribulation quenched your alacrity; nor danger dried up your zeal:
nor the fear of men overcome the desire for God; nor the difficulty
of the times overthrown your earnestness; nay, so far from
overthrowing, it has strengthened it; so far from slackening, it
has given it more intensity; so far from quenching, has kindled it
the more. The forum is indeed empty, but the church is filled; the
former supplies material for melancholy, the latter is an occasion
of joy and spiritual gladness! When therefore, beloved, you betake
yourself to the forum, and the sight of the solitude calls forth a
groan, fly back to thy Mother, and straightway she will console
thee with the multitude of her offspring and will show thee the
chorus of the Brethren complete, and will drive away all thy
despondency! For in the city we are as earnestly longing to see
human beings, as those who inhabit the deserts; but when we take
refuge in the church, we are straitened for room by the multitude.
And as when the sea is in uproar, and rendered furious by the
violent tempest, fear compels all to fly for refuge from without
into the harbour; so also now, the waves of the forum, and the
tempest of the city, drives together every one from all sides into
the church, and by the bond of love knits the members close to one
another.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.vi-p4">2. Let us then give thanks to God even for
these things, that we have reaped so much fruit from the
tribulation; that we have received so great an advantage from the
trial. If there were no trial, there would be no crown; if there
were no wrestlings, there would be no prize; if there were no

out, there would be no honours; if there were no tribulation, there
would be no rest; if there were no winter, there would be no
summer. And this may be observed, not only amongst men, but even
with the very seeds; for if, in that case, we expect the ear of
corn to spring and flourish, there must be much rain, much
gathering of the clouds, and much frost; and the time of sowing is
also a rainy season. Since therefore the winter, a winter not of
the elements, but of souls, has now set in, let us too sow in this
winter that we may reap in the summer; let us sow tears, that we
may reap gladness. This is not my word, it is a prophetic promise,
“They who sow in tears, shall reap in joy.”<note place="end" n="1190" id="xix.vi-p5.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.vi-p6"> <scripRef passage="Ps. cxxv. 5" id="xix.vi-p6.1" parsed="|Ps|25|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.25.5">Ps. cxxv.

not so make the seeds to sprout and grow, as the shower of falling
tears maketh the seed of godliness to spring up and flourish. This
it is that cleanseth the soul; watereth the mind, and causeth the
growing germ of doctrine to push rapidly forwards. For this reason
also, it is needful to plough up a deep furrow. This the Prophet
signified when he spoke thus, “Break up your fallow ground, and
sow not among thorns.”<note place="end" n="1191" id="xix.vi-p6.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.vi-p7"> <scripRef passage="Jer. iv. 3" id="xix.vi-p7.1" parsed="|Jer|4|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Jer.4.3">Jer. iv.

the plough on the field, turns up the earth from below, preparing
beforehand a safe lodgment for the seeds, in order that they may
not lie dispersed over the surface, but may be hidden in the very
womb of the earth, and deposit their roots in safety: so also it is
our business to act; and making use of the plough of tribulation to
break up the depth of the heart. For another Prophet admonishes of
this, when he says, “Rend your hearts and not your garments.”<note place="end" n="1192" id="xix.vi-p7.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.vi-p8"> <scripRef passage="Joel ii. 13" id="xix.vi-p8.1" parsed="|Joel|2|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Joel.2.13">Joel ii.

then rend our hearts, that if any evil plant, any treacherous
thought be present in 
<pb n="365" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_365.html" id="xix.vi-Page_365" />us, we may tear it up by the roots, and provide a
pure soil for the seeds of godliness. For if we do not now break up
the fallow ground; if we do not now sow; if we do not now water it
with tears, whilst it is a time of tribulation and fasting, when
shall we ever be brought to compunction? Will it be when we are at
ease, and in luxury? But this is impossible. For ease and luxury
generally lead to indolence, just as tribulation leads back again
to diligence; and restores to itself the mind that had wandered
abroad, and been dreaming after a multitude of objects.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.vi-p9">3. Let us not then grieve on account of this
despondency, but even give thanks to God, for great is the gain
that comes of tribulation. The husbandman, when he has sown the
seed he had gathered with so much labour, prays that a shower may
come; and the ignorant man, looking on, will be surprised at all
that takes place; and perhaps say to himself, “what can this man
be doing? He is scattering what he has collected; and not only
scattering, but he is also mixing it up in the earth with much
industry, so that it will be no easy matter for him to collect
these together again; and besides mixing them with the earth, he is
moreover desiring a heavy rain, so that all he has cast therein
will rot, and become mire.” Such a person is also terrified when
he observes the thunders bursting through the clouds, and the
lightnings striking downwards. But not so the farmer. He is glad
and rejoices whilst beholding the heavy rain. For he does not
regard what is present, but awaits the future. He does not attend
to the thunderings, but is reckoning the number of his sheaves. He
thinks not of the decaying seed, but of the flourishing ears of
corn; not of the tedious rain, but of the delightful dust of the
threshing floor. Thus indeed, also, should we regard, not our
present tribulation, nor the pain of it, but the benefit that may
arise from it—the fruit that it will bring forth. Let us wait for
the sheaves of the threshing floor; for if we be sober, we shall be
able to collect much fruit from the present time, and to fill the
granaries of our minds. If we be sober, we shall not only be far
from taking any harm from this trouble, but we shall also reap
innumerable benefits. But should we be slothful, even tranquillity
will destroy us! Either of these things is injurious to him who
takes no heed; but they both profit him who lives with strictness.
And even as gold if it be covered with water, still shows its own
proper beauty, and although it should fall into the furnace, would
again come forth brighter than before; but on the other hand,
should clay or grass be mixed with water, the one dissolves and the
other corrupts; and should they fall into the fire, the one is
parched and the other is burnt up; so also in truth it is with the
just man and the sinner! For should the former enjoy repose, he
remains illustrious, even as gold is when immersed in water; and
though he falls into trial, he becomes the more illustrious, like
gold when subjected to the test of fire; but the sinner, if he
obtains rest, is enervated and corrupted like the grass and the
clay, when they come in contact with water; and should he undergo
trial, he is burnt up and destroyed, in the same way as the grass
and the clay are by the action of fire!</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.vi-p10">4. Let us not then be out of heart for the
present evils; for if thou hast any sins<note place="end" n="1193" id="xix.vi-p10.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.vi-p11"> ƒμαρτίας. This seems from the contrast to
mean “sinful habits,” which trouble affords facilities for
amending. Had he meant removing <i>guilt</i>, he would probably
have said ƒμαρτήματα, or

he speaks of the removal of guilt as depending on the <i>use</i>
made of chastisement. Also on <scripRef passage="Rom. v. 11" id="xix.vi-p11.1" parsed="|Rom|5|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.5.11">Rom. v. 11</scripRef>; Hom. IX .; see also Hom.

and easily be burnt up by the tribulation; but if thou possessest
virtue, thou wilt become thereby more illustrious and
distinguished; for if thou art continually vigilant and sober, thou
wilt be superior to all injury. For it is not the nature of the
trials, but the listlessness of those who are tried, that is apt to
cause their overthrow. So that if thou desirest to rejoice, and to
enjoy ease and pleasure, seek neither for pleasure nor ease, but
seek for a soul full of patience, and one that is able to manifest
fortitude; since if thou hast not this, not only will trial put
thee to shame, but repose will destroy and overthrow thee yet more
signally. For to prove that it is not the attack of evils, but the
listlessness of the mind which subverts our salvation, hear what
Christ saith: “Whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth
them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon
a rock; and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds
blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not, for it was founded
upon a rock.” And again: “Every one who heareth these sayings
of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man,
which built his house upon the sand; and the rain descended, and
the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and
it fell, and great was the fall of it.”<note place="end" n="1194" id="xix.vi-p11.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.vi-p12"> <scripRef passage="Matt. vii. 24-27" id="xix.vi-p12.1" parsed="|Matt|7|24|7|27" osisRef="Bible:Matt.7.24-Matt.7.27">Matt.
vii. 24–27</scripRef>.</p></note> Do you perceive that it was not
the attack of these trials that produced the overthrow, but the
folly of the builders? For there was rain there, and there was rain
here; there were floods there, 
<pb n="366" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_366.html" id="xix.vi-Page_366" />and there were floods here; here the
beating of winds, and there again the same. The one man built a
house, and the other built a house. The building was the same; the
trials were the same; but the end was not the same; because there
was not the same foundation. For the folly of the builder, not the
nature of the trials, caused the fall of the building; otherwise
the house that was founded upon the rock should have fallen,
whereas nothing of that kind befell it. But do not suppose that
these things were spoken merely of a house; for the discourse
relates to a soul, giving proof by its works that it hears the
divine word, or rejects it. Thus Job builded up his soul. The rain
descended;—for the fire fell from heaven and devoured all his
flocks; the floods came;—the frequent,—the constant,—the
successive messengers of his calamities, telling him of the
destruction of his herds—of his camels—of his children. The
winds blew,—the bitter words of his wife:—“Curse God,” she
said, “and die.”<note place="end" n="1195" id="xix.vi-p12.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.vi-p13"> <scripRef passage="Job ii. 9" id="xix.vi-p13.1" parsed="|Job|2|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Job.2.9">Job ii.

was not supplanted: the just man did not blaspheme; but even gave
thanks thus, saying, “The Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away.

that not the nature of the trials, but the negligence of the
indolent, is wont to cause the overthrow? since tribulation makes
the strong man stronger. Who saith this? It is the man who lived in
tribulation, the blessed Paul; he speaks thus: “Tribulation
worketh patience, and patience probation, and probation hope.”<note place="end" n="1197" id="xix.vi-p14.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.vi-p15"> <scripRef passage="Rom. v. 3, 4" id="xix.vi-p15.1" parsed="|Rom|5|3|5|4" osisRef="Bible:Rom.5.3-Rom.5.4">Rom. v.

as the violence of the wind, when it rushes upon strong trees, and
sways them in all directions, does not root them up, but renders
them still firmer and stronger by these attacks; so the soul that
is holy, and lives in a religious state, is not supplanted by the
inroads of trial and tribulation, but stimulated thereby to more
patience; even as the blessed Job, whom they made more illustrious
and honourable.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.vi-p16">5. At the present time then, a man is angry with us,
a man of like passions, and of like soul, and we are afraid: but in
the case of Job it was an evil and malignant demon who was angry;
nay, he was not simply angry, but set in motion all sorts of
machinations, and brought forward every stratagem; and yet even
with all he could not conquer the fortitude of the just man. But
here is a man, who is at one time angry, at another time is
reconciled; and we are nevertheless dead with fear. On that
occasion it was a devil that waged war, who is never reconciled to
human nature, but has engaged in a war without treaty, and a battle
without truce against our race; yet nevertheless, the just man
laughed his darts to scorn. What apology then, or what pardon can
be ours, if we cannot sustain a human trial; we who are taught such
spiritual wisdom under grace; when this man before grace, and
before the Old Testament, endured this most grievous war so nobly!
These things, beloved, we should therefore always discourse of with
one another; and by words of this kind encourage ourselves. For ye
are witnesses, and your conscience is a witness how much gain we
have already received from this trial! The dissolute man hath now
become sober; the bold man meek; the slothful man active. They who
never at any time saw a church, but constantly spent their time at
the theatre, now remain in the church the whole day long. Tell me
then, dost thou grieve on this account, that God hath made thee
earnest through fear; that He hath led thee by tribulation to a
sense of thine own safety? But is thy conscience pained? Yea, is
thy mind pierced every day as with a dart, expecting death, and the
greatest wrath? Nevertheless, from thence too we shall gain a great
advance toward virtue, if our piety is made more earnest by means
of the distress. For God is able to free you from all these evils
this day. But not until He sees that you are purified; not until He
sees that a conversion has taken place, and a repentance firm and
unshaken, will He entirely remove the tribulation. The goldsmith,
until he perceives the gold well refined, will not draw it out from
the furnace; and even so God will not take away this cloud before
He hath thoroughly amended us. For He Himself who hath permitted
this trial, knows the time for removing it. So it is also with one
who plays the harp; he neither overstrains the string, lest he
break it, nor relaxes it too much, lest he mar the consonance of
its harmony. Thus does God act. He neither places our souls in a
state of constant repose, nor of lengthened tribulation; making use
of both these at His discretion; for he neither suffers us to enjoy
continual repose, lest we should grow listless, nor on the other
hand does he permit us to be in constant tribulation, lest we sink
under it, and become desperate.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.vi-p17">6. Let us then leave to Him the time for the
removal of our evils; let <i>us</i> only pray; let <i>us</i> live
in piety: for this is our work, to turn to virtue; but to set us
free from these evils is God’s work! For indeed He is more
desirous to quench this fire than thou who art <pb n="367" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_367.html" id="xix.vi-Page_367" />tried by it: but He is waiting
for thy salvation. As tribulation then came of rest, so also after
tribulation, rest must be expected. For neither is it always
winter, nor always summer; neither are there always waves, nor
always a calm; neither always night, nor always day. Thus
tribulation is not perpetual, but there will be also repose; only
in our tribulation, let us give thanks to God always. For the three
youths were cast into the furnace, and did not even for this forget
their piety; neither did the flames affright them, but more
earnestly than men sitting in a chamber, and suffering nothing to
alarm them, did they, whilst encircled by the fire, send up to
heaven those sacred prayers<note place="end" n="1198" id="xix.vi-p17.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.vi-p18"> St. Chrysostom refers to the Benedicite, or
“Song of the Three Children.” In his book <i>Quod nemo læditur
nisi a seipso</i>, he calls it “That admirable and marvellous
song, which from that day to this hath been sung every where
throughout the world, and shall yet be sung in future
generations.” Ben. t. iii. 464; E. quoted by Bingham, b. xiv. c.
ii., sec. 6, New Ed., vol. iv., p. 461.</p></note>—therefore the fire became a wall
unto them, and the flame a robe; and the furnace was a fountain;
and whereas it received them bound, it restored them free. It
received bodies that were mortal, but abstained from them as if
they had been immortal! It knew their nature, yet it reverenced
their piety! The tyrant bound their feet, and their feet bound the
operation of the fire! O marvellous thing! The flame loosed those
who were bound, and was itself afterwards bound by those who had
been in bonds; for the piety of the youths changed the nature of
things; or rather it did not change the nature, but, what was far
more wonderful, it stayed the operation of them, even whilst their
nature remained. For it did not quench the fire, but though
burning, made it powerless. And it was truly marvellous and
unaccountable, that this not only happened with respect to the
bodies of these saints, but also with respect to their garments,
and their shoes. And as it was in the case of the Apostles, the
garments of Paul expelled diseases and demons,<note place="end" n="1199" id="xix.vi-p18.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.vi-p19"> <scripRef passage="Acts xix. 12" id="xix.vi-p19.1" parsed="|Acts|19|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.19.12">Acts xix.

also in this case, the shoes of these youths extinguished the power
of the fire.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.vi-p22">7. I know not how I should speak, for the
wonder surpasses all description! The force of the fire was both
quenched and not quenched: for whilst it came in contact with the
bodies of these saints, it was quenched; but when it was needful to
burst their bonds, it was not quenched; wherefore it broke their
bonds, but touched not their ancles.<note place="end" n="1202" id="xix.vi-p22.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.vi-p23"> <scripRef passage="Dan. iii. 25" id="xix.vi-p23.1" parsed="|Dan|3|25|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Dan.3.25">Dan. iii.

Yet the fire was not deceived, and dared not penetrate within the
bonds. The tyrant bound, and the flame set loose; that thou
mightest learn at once the fierceness of the barbarian, and the
submissiveness of the element. For what reason did he bind, when he
was about to cast into the fire? In order that the miracle might be
the greater; that the sign might be the more unaccountable; that
thou mayest not suppose that the things seen were an optical
delusion. For if that fire had been no fire, it would not have
consumed the bands; and what is much more, it would not have seized
upon the soldiers who were placed without the furnace; but as the
case was, it showed its power upon those without; but towards those
within, its submissiveness. But observe, I pray, in everything, how
the devil by the very same means with which he fights with the
servants of God, pulls down his own power; not intentionally, but
because the wisdom and abundant contrivance of God turns all his
weapons and devices upon his own head; which assuredly happened on
that occasion. For the devil at that time inspiring the tyrant,
neither suffered the heads of the saints to be cut off with the
sword, nor that they should be delivered to wild beasts, nor
punished in any such manner; but that they should be thrown into
the fire; to the end that not even any relics of these saints
should remain, their bodies being altogether consumed, and their
ashes being mingled with the ashes of the fagots. But God
accordingly employed this very circumstance for the taking away of
impiety.<note place="end" n="1203" id="xix.vi-p23.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.vi-p24"> τὴς ‡σεβείας, used

<i>right</i> religion, but this use of the words belongs rather to
the Fathers than to the New Testament.</p></note> And how? I
will tell you. Fire is accounted by the Persians to be a god; and
the barbarians, who inhabit that country even now honour it with
much worship. God, therefore, being desirous to pull up by the
roots the material of impiety, permitted the punishment to take
this form, in order that He might give the victory to His servants
before the eyes of all these fire-worshippers; persuading them by
the plain fact, that the gods of the Gentiles are in dread not of
God only, but even of the servants of God.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.vi-p25">8. Consider, moreover, how the crown of this
victory was woven by the adversaries, and the enemies themselves
were made witnesses of this trophy. For “Nebuchadnezzar,” it
says, “sent to gather together the princes, the governors, and
the captains, the judges, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the
provinces, to come to the dedication of the image, and they were
all gathered together.”<note place="end" n="1204" id="xix.vi-p25.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.vi-p26"> <scripRef passage="Dan. iii. 2" id="xix.vi-p26.1" parsed="|Dan|3|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Dan.3.2">Dan. iii.

<pb n="368" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_368.html" id="xix.vi-Page_368" />The enemy prepares the theatre, and he
himself collects together the spectators, and prepares the lists; a
theatre too, not of chance persons, or of some private individuals,
but of all those who were honourable and in authority, to the end
that their testimony may be worthy of credit with the multitude.
They had come summoned for one thing; but they all departed having
beheld another thing. They came in order to worship the image; and
they departed, having derided the image, and struck with wonder at
the power of God, through the signs which had taken place with
respect to these young men. And observe, where the field for this
display was spread out. No city, nor select enclosure furnished
room for this theatre of the whole world, but smooth and naked
plains. For in the plain of Dura, outside the city, he set up the
image, and the herald came and cried, “To you it is commanded, O
people, nations, and languages, that at what time ye hear the sound
of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all
kinds of music, ye fall down and worship the golden image;” (for
a fall indeed it was to worship the idol) “and whoso falleth not
down, and worshippeth, shall the same hour be cast into the midst
of a burning fiery furnace.”<note place="end" n="1205" id="xix.vi-p26.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.vi-p27"> <scripRef passage="Dan. iii. 4, 6" id="xix.vi-p27.1" parsed="|Dan|3|4|0|0;|Dan|3|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Dan.3.4 Bible:Dan.3.6">Dan. iii.
4, 6</scripRef>.</p></note> Seest thou how difficult these
struggles are made; how irresistible the snare; and how deep the
gulph, and a precipice on either hand? But be not afraid. In
whatever degree the enemy increases his machinations, so much the
more does he display the courage of the young men. For this reason
is there this symphony of so many musicians; for this reason the
burning furnace; in order that both pleasure, and fear, may besiege
the souls of those present. Is there any one of harsh and
unyielding character among them? “Let the melody of every kind of
music,” saith he, “enchant and soften him.” But is he
superior to this artifice, “let the sight of the flame affright
and astound him.” Thus was fear as well as pleasure present; the
one entering to assault the soul by the ears, the other by the
eyes. But the noble character of these youths was not by any such
means to be conquered; but even as, when they fell into the fire,
they mastered the flames, even so they derided all desire and all
fear. For it was for them the devil had prepared all these things
beforehand. For he had no doubts of his own subjects, but was
exceedingly confident that no one would resist the royal mandate.
But when all fell down, and were subdued, then the youths alone are
led into the midst; in order that from this too the conquest may
become the more illustrious, they alone conquering and being
proclaimed victors among so vast a multitude. For this would not
have been so surprising if they had acted courageously at the
first, when as yet no one had been overthrown. But the greatest,
and most astonishing fact was, that the multitude of those who fell
down, neither affrighted, nor enfeebled them. They did not say to
themselves any such things as many are ofttimes wont to say; “If
we were the first, and the only persons to worship the image, this
would have been a sin: but if we do this with so many myriads, who
will not make allowance? who will not think us worthy of
defence?” nothing of that sort did they say or think, when they
beheld the prostrate forms<note place="end" n="1206" id="xix.vi-p27.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.vi-p28"> πτώματα, usually of

πυρ€ννων.</p></note> Consider
thou also with me the wickedness of those who were their accusers,
and how maliciously and bitterly they brought the accusation!
“There are,” say they, “certain Jews whom thou hast set up
over the works of the province of Babylon.” They did not merely
make mention of the nation, but they also bring to mind their
honourable condition, that they may inflame the wrath of the king;
almost as if they had said, “These slaves, these captives, who
are without a city, thou hast made rulers over us. But they shew
contempt for such honour, and treat insolently him who has given
them this honour!” Therefore they say this; “The Jews whom thou
hast set over the works of the province of Babylon, obey not thy
decree, nor serve thy gods.”<note place="end" n="1208" id="xix.vi-p29.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.vi-p30"> <scripRef passage="Dan. iii. 12" id="xix.vi-p30.1" parsed="|Dan|3|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Dan.3.12">Dan. iii.

greatest praise; and the crimes imputed, their encomium; a
testimony indeed that is indubitable, since their enemies bring it
forward. What then does the king? He commands that they should be
brought into the midst, so that he may affright them in every way.
But nothing dismayed them, neither the wrath of the king, nor their
being left alone in the midst of so many, nor the sight of the
fire, nor the sound of the trumpet, nor the whole multitude looking
fire at them; for deriding all these things, as if they were about
to be cast into a cool fountain of water, they entered the furnace
uttering that blessed sentence, “We will not serve thy gods, nor
worship the golden image which thou hast set up.”<note place="end" n="1209" id="xix.vi-p30.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.vi-p31"> <scripRef passage="Dan. iii. 18" id="xix.vi-p31.1" parsed="|Dan|3|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Dan.3.18">Dan. iii.

<p class="c10" id="xix.vi-p32">9. I have not referred to this history without
reason, but that ye may learn that whether it be the wrath of a
king, or the <pb n="369" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_369.html" id="xix.vi-Page_369" />violence of
soldiers, or the envy of enemies, or captivity, or destitution, or
fire, or furnace, or ten thousand terrors, nothing will avail to
put to shame or terrify a righteous man. For if where the king was
godless the youths were not dismayed at the tyrant’s wrath, how
much more ought we to be confident, having an emperor who is humane
and merciful, and to express thankfulness to God for this
tribulation, knowing from what has now been said, that tribulations
render men more illustrious both in the presence of God and of man,
if they know how to bear them with fortitude! For indeed if these
had not been made slaves, we should not have known their freedom!
If they had not been captives, we should not have learned their
nobility of soul! If they had not been exiles from their country
below, we should not have known the excellency of their citizenship
above! If the earthly king had not been angry with them, we should
not have known the favour with which they were regarded by the
heavenly King!</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.vi-p33">10. Thou too then, if thou hast Him for thy
Friend, be not despairing, although thou fallest into the furnace:
and in like manner if He be angry, think not thou art safe though
thou be in Paradise. For Adam indeed was in Paradise, yet, when he
had provoked God, Paradise profited him nothing. These youths were
in the furnace; yet, since they were approved, the furnace injured
them not at all. Adam was in Paradise, but when he was supine, he
was supplanted! Job sat down on the dunghill, yet, since he was
vigilant he prevailed! Yet how much better was Paradise than a
dunghill! still the excellency of the place benefitted in no degree
the inhabitant; forasmuch as he had betrayed himself; as likewise
indeed the vileness of the place did to one no injury, who was
fortified on every side with virtue. As to ourselves then, let us
fortify our souls; for if the loss of wealth should threaten us, or
even death, and yet no one can rob us of our religion, we are the
happiest of men, Christ commended this when he said, “Be ye wise
as serpents.”<note place="end" n="1210" id="xix.vi-p33.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.vi-p34"> <scripRef passage="Matt. x. 16" id="xix.vi-p34.1" parsed="|Matt|10|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.10.16">Matt. x.

thou. Although it should be necessary to expose wealth, or the
body, or the present life, or all things, for the purpose of
preserving thy religion; be not cast down! For if thou depart hence
in possession of that, God will restore to thee all things with
more abundant splendour, and will raise again thy body with greater
glory; and instead of riches, there will be the good things that
surpass all power of description. Did not Job sit naked on a
dunghill, sustaining a life more grievous than ten thousand deaths?
Yet since he did not cast away his piety, all his former things
came back to him in greater abundance, soundness and beauty of
body; his full band of children; his possessions; and what was
greater than all, the splendid crown of his patience. For as it
happens with trees, should any one pluck away the fruit and the
leaves together; should he even cut off all the branches letting
the root only remain; the tree will rise again entire, with greater
beauty, so indeed is it also with us. If the root of piety remain,
although wealth be taken away, although the body destroyed, all
things again revert to us with greater glory than before. Casting
away therefore all anxiety and superfluous care, let us return to
ourselves; and let us adorn the body and the soul with the ornament
of virtue; converting our bodily members into instruments of
righteousness and not instruments of sin.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.vi-p36">11. And first of all, let us discipline our

using disgraceful words. For it is in our power to make each one of
our members an instrument of wickedness, or of righteousness. Hear
then how men make the tongue an instrument, some of sin, others of
righteousness! “Their tongue is a sharp sword.”<note place="end" n="1212" id="xix.vi-p36.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.vi-p37"> <scripRef passage="Ps. lvii. 4" id="xix.vi-p37.1" parsed="|Ps|57|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.57.4">Ps. lvii.

was the same, but the operation was not the same. And again, as to
the mouth likewise, we may see this same thing. For these had a
mouth full of filth and of wickedness, therefore against such it is
said by way of accusation, “Their mouth is full of cursing and
bitterness;”<note place="end" n="1215" id="xix.vi-p39.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.vi-p40"> <scripRef passage="Ps. xiv. 6" id="xix.vi-p40.1" parsed="|Ps|14|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.14.6">Ps. xiv.

their hands full of iniquity, and accusing these he said,

with reference to the heart; for their heart indeed was foolish,

<p class="c10" id="xix.vi-p47">12. Knowing these things then, let us fortify
ourselves with virtue on all sides, and thus we shall avert the
wrath of God, and let us make the members of the body instruments
of righteousness; and let us discipline eyes, and mouth, and hands,
and feet, and heart, and tongue, and the<note place="end" n="1222" id="xix.vi-p47.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.vi-p48"> Sav. our.</p></note> whole body, to be employed only in
the service of virtue. And let us remember those three precepts, of
which I discoursed<note place="end" n="1223" id="xix.vi-p48.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.vi-p49"> <i>i.e</i>., at the close of the last Homily.</p></note> to your Charity, exhorting you to
consider no one as an enemy, nor to speak evil of any one of those
who have aggrieved you; and to expel from your mouth the evil
custom of oaths. And with respect to the two former precepts, we
will discourse to you on another occasion; but we shall speak to
you during the whole of the present week respecting oaths; thus
beginning with the easier precept. For it is no labour at all to
overcome the habit of swearing, if we would but apply a little
endeavour, by reminding each other; by advising; by observing; and
by requiring those who thus forget themselves, to render an
account, and to pay the penalty. For what advantage shall we gain
by abstinence from meats, if we do not also expel the evil habits
of the soul? Lo, we have spent the whole of this day fasting; and
in the evening we shall spread a table, not such as we did on
yester-eve, but one of an altered and more solemn kind.<note place="end" n="1224" id="xix.vi-p49.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.vi-p50"> σεμνοτ™ραν. Tillemont
supposes as well as Montfaucon, that the preceding Homily (the 3d)
was delivered on Quinquagesima Sunday, and that this (the 4th) was
preached on the Monday, which explains this allusion, Tr. The Lent
fast began with that Monday. During Lent the Greek Church allows
the use of fish on Sundays.</p></note> Can any
one of us then say that he has changed his life too this day; that
he has altered his ill custom, as well as his food? Truly, I
suppose not! Of what advantage then is our fasting? Wherefore I
exhort,<note place="end" n="1225" id="xix.vi-p50.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.vi-p51"> Or, beseech.</p></note> and I will
not cease to exhort, that undertaking each precept separately, you
should spend two or three days in the attainment of it; and just as
there are some who rival one another in fasting, and shew a
marvellous emulation in it; (some indeed who spend two whole days
without food; and others who, rejecting from their tables not only
the use of wine, and of oil, but of every dish, and taking only
bread and water, persevere in this practice during the whole of
Lent); so, indeed, let us also contend mutually with one another in
abolishing the frequency<note place="end" n="1226" id="xix.vi-p51.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.vi-p52"> νιφ€δας, lit.
snowflakes. Comp. <i>Il</i>. iii. 222.</p></note> of oaths. For this is more useful
than any fasting; this is more profitable than any austerity. And
this same care which we display in abstaining from food, let us
exhibit with respect to abstinence from oaths; since we shall be
chargeable with the reproach of extreme folly, while we regard not
things that are forbidden, and expend all our care upon things
indifferent; for to eat is not forbidden, but to swear is
forbidden; we, however, abstaining from those things that are
permitted, daringly venture upon those things that are forbidden!
On this account I beseech your Charity to make some change, and to
let the beginning of it be visible from this day. For if we spend
the whole of the present fast with such zeal, having in this week
attained the practice of not swearing at all; and in the following
having extinguished wrath; and in that which succeeds it, having
pulled up evil-speaking by the roots; and after that, having
amended what yet remains; thus going forward in our course, we
shall come by little and little to the very summit of virtue; and
we shall escape the present danger; and shall make God propitious;
and the multitude will come back again to our city; and we shall
teach the fugitives that we are to place our hopes of safety
neither in security of place, nor in flight and retirement; but in
piety of soul, and in virtue of manners. And thus shall we obtain
the good things of this and of the future life; which, God grant!
we may all be found worthy of, by the grace and loving-kindness of
our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom and with whom be glory to the
Father, together with the Holy Ghost, now and for ever and ever.
Amen.</p>

<p class="c38" id="xix.vii-p2">The exhortation of the last Homily is continued in
this. The people are exhorted to bear with fortitude the impending
wrath of the Emperor. The cases of Job and the Ninevites are
referred to as examples. It is shewn that men ought not to fear
death, but sin. What it is to die miserably is explained; and the
Homily concludes with an earnest dissuasive against the use of
oaths.</p>

<p class="c9" id="xix.vii-p3">1. <span class="c12" id="xix.vii-p3.1">The</span> discourse
concerning the three young men, and the Babylonian furnace, did, as
it would seem, yesterday give no small comfort to your Charity; and
still more the example in the case of Job, and that dunghill more
to be venerated than any kingly throne. For from seeing a royal
throne no advantage results to the spectators, but only a temporary
pleasure, which has no profit; but from the sight of Job’s
dunghill, one may derive every kind of benefit, yea, much divine
wisdom and consolation, in order to patience. Therefore to this day
many undertake a long pilgrimage,<note place="end" n="1227" id="xix.vii-p3.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.vii-p4"> Comp. Hom. I. 23; Hom. XXXI. on <scripRef passage="Rom. xvi. 4" id="xix.vii-p4.1" parsed="|Rom|16|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.16.4">Rom. xvi. 4</scripRef>.</p></note> even across the sea, hastening
from the extremities of the earth, as far as Arabia, that they may
see that dunghill; and having beheld it, may kiss the land, which
contained the wrestling-ground<note place="end" n="1228" id="xix.vii-p4.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.vii-p5"> τὴν δεξαμ™νην τὰ

blood that was more precious than all gold! For the purple shines
not so brilliantly, as did that body when dyed<note place="end" n="1229" id="xix.vii-p5.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.vii-p6"> βαπτιζόμενον,
perhaps rather “drenched,” but the mention of the purple favors
“dyed;” the present tense does not admit “baptized,” though
the allusion is well sustained in Ben. <i>tinctum</i>.</p></note> not in another’s blood, but in
its own! Even those very wounds were more precious than all manner
of jewels! For the nature of pearls is of no help to our life; nor
do they satisfy any necessary want on the part of those who have
them. But those wounds are a consolation for all sadness; and that
thou mayest learn this to be the truth, suppose any one were to
lose a beloved and only son. Shew him ten thousand pearls, and you
will not console his grief, or lighten his anguish; but recall to
his mind the wounds of Job, and thou wouldest easily be able to
minister comfort by speaking thus: “Why sorrowest thou, O man?
Thou hast lost one son; but that blessed man, after he had been
bereaved of the whole family of his children, both received a
plague in his own flesh, and sat down naked upon the dunghill,
streaming with gore from every part, and his flesh gradually
wasting away; even he who was just, and true, so devout a man, who
stained from every evil deed, and had even God for a witness to his
virtue.” By speaking thus thou wouldest extinguish all the
sufferer’s sadness, and remove all his distress. Thus the wounds
of the just man become more useful than pearls!</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.vii-p7">2. Figure to yourselves then this wrestler;
and imagine that you see that dunghill, and himself sitting in the
midst of it! That golden statue! set with gems! I know not how to
express it: for I am unable to find any material so precious as to
compare it with that body stained with blood! So far above every
substance, however costly, was the nature of that flesh, beyond all
comparison more precious, and those wounds more splendid than the
sun’s beams; for these illumine the eyes of the body; but those
enlighten the eyes of the mind! those struck the devil with utter
blindness! Therefore it was, that after that blow, he started back
and appeared no more. And do thou, O beloved, learn thence too what
advantage there is in tribulation! For when the just man was rich,
and enjoyed ease, he had the means of accusing him. However
falsely, yet still he had it in his power to say, “Doth Job serve
thee for nought?” But after he had stripped him and made him
poor, he dared not even open his mouth any more. When he was
wealthy, he prepared to wrestle with him, and threatened to
overthrow him; but when he had made him poor, and taken away all he
had, and thrown him into the deepest distress, then he started
back. When indeed his body was sound, he lifted up his hands
against him,<note place="end" n="1230" id="xix.vii-p7.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.vii-p8"> Or buffetted with him, χεῖρας
‡ντῇρεν.</p></note> but when
he had battered his flesh, then he fled,—defeated! Seest thou how
to the vigilant, poverty is much better and more beneficial than
riches; and infirmity and sickness, than health; and trial, than
tranquillity; inasmuch as it makes the combatants more illustrious
and vigorous?</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.vii-p9">3. Who hath seen or heard of such an astonishing
contest? The fighters in worldly contests, when they have battered
the heads of their adversaries, are then victorious, and are
crowned! But this adversary, when he 
<pb n="372" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_372.html" id="xix.vii-Page_372" />had battered the body of the just man,
perforating it with ulcers of every kind, and had reduced him to
great weakness, was then conquered, and drew back. Even when he had
pierced his ribs in every direction, he was no gainer thereby; for
he spoiled him not of his hidden treasure, but he made him more
conspicuous to us; and through that piercing he gave to all the
privilege to look into his interior, and to discern completely the
whole of his wealth! When he expected to prevail, then he withdrew
with much ignominy, and never again uttered a syllable! What is the
matter, O devil? For what cause withdrawest thou? Was not
everything done that thou chosest? Hast thou not taken away his
flocks, his herds, his droves of horses and of mules? Hast thou not
also destroyed his troop of children? and battered his flesh to
pieces. For what reason withdrawest thou? “Because,” saith he,
“every thing I chose<note place="end" n="1231" id="xix.vii-p9.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.vii-p10"> ἠθ™λησα, desired is 
ἐβουλόμην. See Plat. Gorg. where
Socrates argues that a tyrant has no great power, since, though he
can do all he chooses, … δοκεῖ αὐτῷ, he cannot attain what he wishes,
… 
βούλεται.</p></note> is come to pass, and yet that
which I most desired should come to pass, and for which I did all
those things, is not come to pass; he hath not blasphemed! For it
was in order to this, continues he, that I was doing all those
things; and as this is not come to pass, I am no gainer by having
deprived him of his wealth; or by the destruction of his children;
or by the plague inflicted upon his body; but the reverse of what I
purposed hath come to pass; I have made my enemy more illustrious;
I have added lustre to his reputation.” Perceivest thou, O
beloved, how great was the reward of tribulation? His body was fair
and sound before, but it became more venerable, when pierced
through and through by these wounds! And thus wool, fair as it is
before the dyeing, when it becomes purple, takes an indescribable
beauty, and an additional grace. But if he had not stripped him, we
should not have known the good condition<note place="end" n="1232" id="xix.vii-p10.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.vii-p11"> εὐεξίαν. See Hom. I.
16.</p></note> of the victor; if he had not
pierced the body with ulcers, the rays within would not have shone
forth. If he had not made him sit down upon a dunghill, we should
not have known his wealth. For a king sitting on a throne is not so
illustrious, as this man was notable and conspicuous, whilst
sitting upon his dunghill! For after the royal throne, comes death;
but after that dunghill, the kingdom of heaven!</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.vii-p12">4. Collecting then all these reasons, let us raise
ourselves from the dejection which oppresses us. For I have laid
these histories before you, not that ye may applaud what is spoken,
but that ye may imitate the virtue and the patience of such noble
men; that ye may learn from the very facts, that there is nothing
of human ills to be dreaded, save sin only; neither poverty, nor
disease, nor insult, nor malicious treatment, nor ignominy, nor
death, which is accounted the worst of all evils. To those who love
spiritual wisdom, such things are only the names of calamities;
names which have no substantial reality. But the true calamity
consists in offending God, and in doing aught which is displeasing
to Him. For tell me, what is there in death which is terrible? Is
it because it transports thee more quickly to the peaceful haven,
and to that life which is free from tumult? Although man should not
put thee to death, will not the very law of nature, at length
stealing upon thee, separate the body from the soul; and if this
event which we fear does not happen now, it will happen
shortly.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.vii-p13">5. I speak thus, not anticipating any dread or
melancholy event:<note place="end" n="1233" id="xix.vii-p13.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.vii-p14"> <i>i.e</i>., as connected with the present
events.</p></note> God forbid! But because I am
ashamed for those who are afraid of death. Tell me, whilst
expecting such good things as “eye hath not seen, nor ear heard,
nor have entered the heart of man,”<note place="end" n="1234" id="xix.vii-p14.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.vii-p15"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. ii. 9; Isa. lxiv. 4" id="xix.vii-p15.1" parsed="|1Cor|2|9|0|0;|Isa|64|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.2.9 Bible:Isa.64.4">1 Cor.

enjoyment, and art negligent and slothful; and not only slothful,
but fearful and trembling? And is it not shameful that thou art
distressed on account of death, whereas Paul groaned on account of
the present life, and writing to the Romans said, “The creation
groaneth together, and ourselves also which have the first fruits
of the Spirit do groan.”<note place="end" n="1235" id="xix.vii-p15.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.vii-p16"> <scripRef passage="Rom. viii. 22, 23" id="xix.vii-p16.1" parsed="|Rom|8|22|8|23" osisRef="Bible:Rom.8.22-Rom.8.23">Rom.
viii. 22, 23</scripRef>.</p></note> And he spoke thus, not as
condemning the things present, but longing for the things to come.
“I have tasted,” saith he, “of the grace, and I do not
willingly put up with the delay.<note place="end" n="1236" id="xix.vii-p16.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.vii-p17"> οὐ στ™γω. Cf. <scripRef passage="1 Thess. iii. 1" id="xix.vii-p17.1" parsed="|1Thess|3|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Thess.3.1">1 Thess. iii. 1</scripRef>.</p></note> I have the first fruits of the
Spirit, and I press on towards the whole. I have ascended to the
third heaven; I have seen that glory which is unutterable; I have
beheld the shining palaces; I have learnt what joys I am deprived
of, while I linger here, and therefore do I groan.” For suppose
any one had conducted thee into princely halls, and shewn thee the
gold everywhere glittering on the walls, and all the rest of the
glorious show; if from thence he had led thee back afterward to a
poor man’s hut, and promised that in a short time he would bring
thee back to those palaces, and would there give thee a perpetual
mansion; tell me, wouldest thou not indeed languish with desire,
and feel impatient, even at these few days? Thus think <pb n="373" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_373.html" id="xix.vii-Page_373" />then of heaven, and of earth, and
groan with Paul, not because of death, but because of the present
life!</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.vii-p18">6. But grant me, saith one, to be like Paul,
and I shall never be afraid of death. Why, what is it that forbids
thee, O man, to become like Paul? Was he not a poor man? Was he not
a tent maker? Was he not a man of humble position? For if he had
been rich and high born, the poor, when called upon to imitate his
zeal, would have had their poverty to plead; but now thou canst say
nothing of this sort. For this man was one who exercised a manual
art, and supported himself too by his daily labours. And thou,
indeed, from the first hast inherited true religion from thy
fathers; and from thy earliest age hast been nourished in the study
of the sacred writings; but he was “a blasphemer, and a
persecutor, and injurious,”<note place="end" n="1237" id="xix.vii-p18.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.vii-p19"> <scripRef passage="1 Tim. i. 13" id="xix.vii-p19.1" parsed="|1Tim|1|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.1.13">1 Tim. i.

Nevertheless, he so changed all at once, as to surpass all in the

mayest thou shew this? By thy contempt of death: for in this we
differ from the unbelievers. They may well fear death; since they

of the future; what excuse hast thou, if whilst assured of a

those who believe not the resurrection?</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.vii-p25">7. But I have no fear of death, says one, nor
of the act of dying, but of a miserable death, of being beheaded.
Did John then, I ask, die miserably? for he was beheaded. Or did
Stephen die miserably? for he was stoned; and all the martyrs have
thus died wretchedly, according to this objection: since some have
ended their lives by fire; and others by the sword; and some cast
into the ocean; others down a precipice; and others into the jaws
of wild beasts, have so come by their death. To die basely, O man,
is not to come to one’s end by a violent death, but to die in
sin! Hear, at least, the prophet moralising on this very matter,
and saying, “The death of sinners is evil.”<note place="end" n="1243" id="xix.vii-p25.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.vii-p26"> In this rendering of the Septuagint there is a
coincidence with that of the Targum, and the Vulgate, Æthiopic,
and Arabic versions. But the Syriac is conformable with the Hebrew.
The discrepancy may be accounted for by a slight difference in the
reading of the vowel points.</p></note> He does not say that a violent
death is evil; but what then? “The death of sinners is evil.”<note place="end" n="1244" id="xix.vii-p26.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.vii-p27"> <scripRef passage="Ps. xxxiv. 21" id="xix.vii-p27.1" parsed="|Ps|34|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.34.21">Ps.

passage is quoted by Bishop Latimer at the close of a sermon upon
the epistle for the twenty-third Sunday after Trinity, preached
A.D. 1552. His words are, <i>Mors peccatorum pessima</i>. “Death
to sinners is the worst thing that can happen unto them.” “What
meaneth he by that? he signifieth unto us, that the wicked be not
enough punished here, therefore it shall be worse with them after
their death. So that it shall be a change: they that have their
pleasure here, and live according to their desires, they shall come
to afflictions in the other world.”</p></note> And justly
so; for after the departure from this life, there is an intolerable
punishment; undying vengeance, the envenomed worm; the fire
unquenchable, the outer darkness, the chains indissoluble; the
gnashing of teeth, the tribulation, and the anguish, and the
eternal justice.<note place="end" n="1245" id="xix.vii-p27.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.vii-p28"> See Hom. III. on <scripRef passage="Rom. i. 18" id="xix.vii-p28.1" parsed="|Rom|1|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.1.18">Rom. i. 18</scripRef>.</p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.vii-p29">8. Since therefore such evils await sinners, what
advantage can it be to them, though they should end their days at
home, and in their bed? Even so, on the other hand, it can do no
harm to the righteous to lay down the present life through sword,
or steel, or fire, when they are to depart to the good things that
are immortal. Truly “the death of sinners is evil.” Such a
death was that of the rich man, who despised Lazarus. He, when he
had terminated his life by a natural end, at home and on his bed,
and with his relatives about him, experienced after his departure
to the other world a fiery torment; nor was he able to obtain there
even a little comfort, out of all the pleasure he had enjoyed in
the present life! But not so was it with Lazarus; for when lying
upon the pavement, while the dogs came and licked his sores, he had
suffered a violent death (for what could be more painful than
hunger?), but on his departing hence he enjoyed eternal blessings,
luxuriating in the bosom of Abraham! In what respect, then, did it
injure him that he died a violent death? or what did it profit the
rich man, that he died not with violence?</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.vii-p30">9. But, says some one, “We have no fear of dying
by violence, but of dying unjustly; and of being punished in a
similar way with the guilty,—we who have had nothing to do with
the crimes of which we are suspected.” What sayest thou, tell me?
Art thou afraid <pb n="374" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_374.html" id="xix.vii-Page_374" />of dying
unjustly, and wouldest thou wish to die justly. But who is there so
wretched and miserable, that when he had the alternative of dying
unjustly, would rather depart by an act of justice? For if it be
necessary to fear death, it is necessary to fear it when it comes
upon us justly; since he indeed who dies unjustly, is by this very
means made a partaker with all the saints. For many of those who
were approved and distinguished by God, have been subjected to an
unjust end; and first of all Abel. For it was not that he had
sinned against his brother, or done Cain any harm; but inasmuch as
he had honoured God, therefore was he slaughtered. But God
permitted it. Was it, think you, because He loved him, or because
He hated him? Most clearly, because He loved him, and wished to
make his crown the brighter, by that most unjust murder. Seest thou
then, that it becomes us not to be afraid of dying by violence; nor
yet of dying unjustly; but of dying in a state of sin? Abel died
unjustly. Cain lived, groaning and trembling! Which then, I would
ask, was the more blessed of the two; he who went to rest in
righteousness, or he who lived in sin; he who died unjustly, or he
who was justly punished? Would you have me declare unto your
Charity, whence it is that we are afraid of death? The love of the
kingdom hath not penetrated us, nor the desire of things to come
inflamed us: otherwise we should despise all present things, even
as the blessed Paul did. Add to this, on the other hand, that we do
not stand in awe of hell; therefore death is terrible. We are not
sensible of the unsufferable nature of the punishment there;
therefore, instead of sin, we fear death; since if the fear of the
one held possession of our souls, the fear of the other would not
be able to enter.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.vii-p31">10. And this I will endeavour to make manifest, not
from anything of a remote nature, but from what is at our own
doors; and from the events which have happened among us in these
days. For when the Emperor’s letter came, ordering that tribute
to be imposed which was thought to be so intolerable, all were in a
tumult; all quarrelled with it; thought it a sore grievance,
resented it; and when they met one another said, “Our life is not
worth living, the city is undone;—no one will be able to stand
under this heavy burden;” and they were distressed as if placed
in the extremest danger. After this, when the rebellion was
actually perpetrated, and certain vile, yea, thoroughly vile
persons, trampling under foot the laws, threw down the statues, and
involved all in the utmost peril; and now that we are in fear for
our very lives, through the indignation of the Emperor, this loss
of money no longer stings us. But instead of such complaints, I
hear from all a language of a different kind. “Let the Emperor
take our substance, we will gladly be deprived of our fields and
possessions, if any one will but ensure us safety for the bare
body.” As therefore, before the fear of death pressed upon us,
the loss of our wealth tormented us; and after these lawless
outrages had been perpetrated, the fear of death succeeding,
expelled the grief for that loss; so if the fear of hell had held
possession of our souls, the fear of death would not have possessed
them. But even as it is with the body, when two kinds of pain seize
upon us, the more powerful usually overshadows the weaker one, so
also would it now happen; if the dread of future punishment
remained in the soul, that would overshadow all human fear. So that
if any one endeavours always to have the remembrance of hell, he
will deride every kind of death; and this will not only deliver him
from the present distress, but will even rescue him from the flame
to come. For he who is always afraid of hell, will never fall into
the fire of hell; being made sober by this continual fear!</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.vii-p32">11. Permit me, that I now say to you at a
fitting time, “Brethren, be not children in understanding;
howbeit in malice be ye children.”<note place="end" n="1246" id="xix.vii-p32.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.vii-p33"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. xiv. 20" id="xix.vii-p33.1" parsed="|1Cor|14|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.14.20">1 Cor.

ours, if we fear death, but are not fearful of sin. Little children
too are afraid of masks, but fear not the fire. On the contrary, if
they are carried by accident near a lighted candle, they stretch
out the hand without any concern towards the candle and the flame;
yet a mask which is so utterly contemptible terrifies them; whereas
they have no dread of fire, which is really a thing to be afraid
of. Just so we too have a fear of death, which is a mask that might
well be despised; but have no fear of sin, which is truly dreadful;
and, even as fire, devours the conscience! And this is wont to
happen not on account of the nature of the things, but by reason of
our own folly; so that if we were once to consider what death is,
we should at no time be afraid of it. What then, I pray you, is
death? Just what it is to put off a garment. For the body is about
the soul as a garment; and after laying this aside for a short time
by means of death, we shall resume it again with the more
splendour. What is death at most? It is a journey for a season; a
sleep longer than usual! So that if thou fearest <pb n="375" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_375.html" id="xix.vii-Page_375" />death, thou shouldest also fear
sleep! If for those who are dying thou art pained, grieve for those
too who are eating and drinking, for as this is natural, so is
that! Let not natural things sadden thee; rather let things which
arise from an evil choice make thee sorrowful. Sorrow not for the
dying man; but sorrow for him who is living in sin!</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.vii-p34">12. Would you have me mention another reason
on account of which we fear death? We do not live with strictness,
nor keep a clear conscience; for if this were the case nothing
would alarm us, neither death, nor famine, nor the loss of wealth,
nor anything else of this kind. For he who lives virtuously, cannot
be injured by any of these things, or be deprived of his inward
pleasure. For being supported by favourable hopes, nothing will be
able to throw him into dejection. What is there that any one can
possibly effect, by which he can cause the noble-minded man to
become sorrowful? Take away his riches? He has yet wealth that is
in the heavens! Cast him out of his country? He will take his
journey to<note place="end" n="1247" id="xix.vii-p34.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.vii-p35"> στελεῖ εἰς, al. τελεῖ εἰς, is free of.</p></note> that city
which is above! Load him with fetters? He has still his conscience
free, and is insensible to the external chain! Put his body to
death? Yet he shall rise again! And as he who fights with a shadow,
and beaten the air, will be unable to hit any one; so he who is at
war with the just man, is but striking at a shadow, and wasting his
own strength, without being able to inflict any injury upon him.
Grant me then to be sure of the kingdom of heaven; and, if thou
wishest, slay me this day. I shall be thankful to thee for the
slaughter; forasmuch as thou sendest me quickly to the possession
of those good things! “This, however,” says some one, “is
what we especially lament, that hindered as we are by the multitude
of our sins, we shall not attain to that kingdom.” Such being the
case then, leave off lamenting death, and lament thy sins, in order
that thou mayest be freed from them! Grief, indeed, hath had its
existence, not that we should sorrow for the loss of wealth, nor
for death, nor for anything else of that kind, but that we may
employ it for the taking away of our sins.<note place="end" n="1248" id="xix.vii-p35.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.vii-p36"> ƒμαρτημ€των, see Hom. IV. 4.</p></note> And I will make the truth of this
evident by an example. Healing medicines<note place="end" n="1249" id="xix.vii-p36.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.vii-p37"> Thus in Plat. Gorg. 78. Socrates argues that it is

only which they are able to remove; not for those which are in no
respect assisted by them. For instance (for I wish to make the
matter still plainer), the medicine which is able to benefit a
malady of the eyes only, and no other disease, one might justly say
was made only for the sake of the eyes; not for the stomach, nor
for the hands, nor any other member. Let us then transfer this
argument to the subject of grief; and we shall find, that in none
of those things which happen to us, is it of any advantage, except
to correct sin; whence it is apparent that it hath had its
existence only for the destruction of this. Let us now take a
survey of each of those evils which befall us, and let us apply
despondency as a remedy, and see what sort of advantage<note place="end" n="1250" id="xix.vii-p37.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.vii-p38"> M. what is the advantage that.</p></note> results
from it.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.vii-p39">13. Some one is mulcted in property: he
becomes sad, but this does not make good his loss. Some one hath
lost a son: he grieves, but he cannot raise the dead, nor benefit
the departed. Some one hath been scourged, beaten, and insulted; he
becomes sorrowful. This does not recall the insult. Some one falls
into sickness, and a most grievous disease; he is dejected. This
does not remove his disease, but only makes it the more grievous.
Do you see that in none of these cases does sadness answer any
useful purpose? Suppose that any one hath sinned, and is sad. He
blots out the sin; he gets free from the transgression. How is this
shewn? By the declaration of the Lord; for, speaking of a certain
one who had sinned, He said, “Because of his iniquity I made him
sad for a while; and I saw that he was grieved, and he went on
heavily; and I healed his ways.”<note place="end" n="1251" id="xix.vii-p39.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.vii-p40"> <scripRef passage="Isa. lvii. 17" id="xix.vii-p40.1" parsed="|Isa|57|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.57.17">Isa.

version seems rather to give the sense of the Hebrew, and is less

what I have said clearly shews, that neither the loss of riches,
nor insult, nor abuse, nor stripes, nor sickness, nor death, nor
any other thing of that kind can possibly be relieved by the
interference of grief, but sin only can it blot out and do away, it
is evident that this is the only reason why it hath its existence.
Let us therefore no more grieve for the loss of wealth, but let us
grieve only when we commit sin. For great in this case is the gain
that comes of sorrow. Art thou amerced? Be not dejected, for thus
thou wilt not be at all benefited. Hast thou sinned? Then be sorry:
for it is profitable; and consider the skill and wisdom of God. Sin
hath brought forth for us these two things, sorrow and death. For
“in the day thou eatest,” He saith, “thou shalt surely
die;” <pb n="376" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_376.html" id="xix.vii-Page_376" />and to the

both of these things he took away sin, and provided that the mother

only fear sin, and grieve on account of this. And these things I
speak, not anticipating any thing fearful, God forbid! but wishing

said, not that we should bear the wood upon our shoulders, but that

is, died daily, and laughed at death, and despised the present

arms; but a soldier who is afraid of death, will never perform a
noble action. Thus then neither will a Christian man, if fearful of
dangers, perform anything great or admirable; nay, besides this, he
will be apt to be easily vanquished. But not so is it with the man
who is bold and lofty minded. He remains impregnable and
unconquerable. As then the Three Children, when they feared not the
fire, escaped from the fire, so also we, if we fear not death,
shall entirely escape from death. They feared not the fire (for it
is no crime to be burnt), but they feared sin, for it is a crime to
commit impiety. Let us also imitate these and all such, and let us
not be afraid of dangers, and then we shall pass safely through

<p class="c10" id="xix.vii-p55">16. For God even preferred that His own prediction
should fall to the ground, so that the city should not fall. Or
rather, the prophecy did not even so fall to the ground. For if
indeed while the men continued in the same wickedness, the sentence
had not taken effect, some one perhaps might have brought a charge
against what was uttered. But if when they had changed, and
desisted from their iniquity, God also desisted from His <pb n="377" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_377.html" id="xix.vii-Page_377" />wrath, who shall be able any
longer to find fault with the prophecy, or to convict the things
spoken of falsehood. The same law indeed which God had laid down
from the beginning, publishing it to all men by the prophet, was on
that occasion strictly observed. What then is this law? “I shall
speak a sentence,” saith He, “concerning a nation or a kingdom,
to pluck up, and to pull down, and to destroy it; and it shall be,
that if they repent of their evil, I will also repent of the wrath
which I said I would do unto them.”<note place="end" n="1264" id="xix.vii-p55.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.vii-p56"> <scripRef passage="Jer. xviii. 7, 8" id="xix.vii-p56.1" parsed="|Jer|18|7|18|8" osisRef="Bible:Jer.18.7-Jer.18.8">Jer.

those who were converted and released from His wrath those who
desisted from their wickedness. He knew the virtue of the
barbarians; therefore He hastened the prophet thither. Thus was the
city agitated at the time, when it heard the prophet’s voice, but
instead of being injured it was benefited by fear. For that fear
was the cause of its safety. The threatening effected the
deliverance from the peril. The sentence of overthrow put a stop to
the overthrow. O strange and astonishing event! the sentence
threatening death, brought forth life! The sentence after it was
published became cancelled; the very opposite to that which takes
place among temporal judges! for in their case the proclamation of
the sentence causes it to become valid, is fully to ratify it; but
on the contrary, with God, the publication of the sentence, caused
it to be cancelled. For if it had not been published, the offenders
would not have heard; and if they had not heard, they would not

punishment, nor would they have obtained that astonishing
deliverance. For how is it less than astonishing, when the judge
declares sentence, and the condemned discharge the sentence by
their repentance! They, indeed, did not flee from the city as we
are now doing, but remaining in it they caused it to stand. It was
a snare, and they made it a fortification! It was a gulph, and a
precipice, and they turned it into a tower of safety! They had
heard that the buildings would fall, and yet they fled not from the
buildings, but they fled from their sins. They did not depart each
from his house as we do now, but each departed from his evil way;
for, said they, “why should we think the walls have brought forth
the wrath? we are the causes of the wound; we then should provide
the medicine.” Therefore they trusted for safety, not to a change
of habitations,<note place="end" n="1266" id="xix.vii-p57.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.vii-p58"> τόπων.</p></note> but of
habits.<note place="end" n="1267" id="xix.vii-p58.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.vii-p59"> τρόπων.</p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.vii-p60">17. Thus did the barbarians! and are we not
ashamed, and ought we not to hide our faces, whilst instead of
changing our habits, as they did, we change only our habitations;
privily removing our goods, and doing the deeds of men that are
drunken? Our Master is angry with us; and we, neglecting to appease
His wrath, carry about our household stuff from place to place, and
run hither and thither, seeking where we may deposit our substance;
while we ought rather to seek where we may deposit our soul in
safety; or rather, it behoveth us not to seek, but to entrust its
safety to virtue and uprightness of life. For when we were angry
and displeased with a servant, if he, instead of defending himself
against our displeasure, went down to his apartment, and collecting
together his clothes, and binding up together all his movables,
meditated a flight, we could not tamely put up with this contempt.
Let us then desist from this unseasonable endeavour, and let us
each say to God, “Whither shall I go from Thy Spirit, and whither
shall I flee from Thy presence?”<note place="end" n="1268" id="xix.vii-p60.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.vii-p61"> <scripRef passage="Ps. cxxxix. 7" id="xix.vii-p61.1" parsed="|Ps|39|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.39.7">Ps.
cxxxix. 7</scripRef>.</p></note> Let us imitate the spiritual
wisdom of the barbarians. They repented even on uncertain grounds!
For the sentence had no such clause, “If ye turn and repent, I
will set up the city;” but simply, “Yet three days, and Nineveh
shall be overthrown.”<note place="end" n="1269" id="xix.vii-p61.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.vii-p62"> <scripRef passage="Jonah iii. 9" id="xix.vii-p62.1" parsed="|Jonah|3|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Jonah.3.9">Jonah
iii. 9</scripRef>.</p></note> What then said they? “Who
knoweth whether God will repent of the evil He said He would do
unto us?” Who knoweth? They know not the end of the event, and
yet they do not neglect repentance! They are unacquainted with
God’s method of shewing mercy, and yet they change upon the
strength of uncertainties! For neither was it in their power to
look at other Ninevites who had repented and been saved; nor had
they read prophets; nor had they heard patriarchs; nor had they
enjoyed counsel, or partaken of admonition; nor had they persuaded
themselves that they should certainly propitiate God by repentance.
For the threatening did not imply this: but they were doubtful, and
hesitating concerning it; and yet they repented with all diligence.
What reason then shall we have to urge, when those, who had no
ground for confidence as to the issue, are seen to have exhibited
so great a change; but thou who hast ground of confidence in the
mercy of God, and who hast frequently received many pledges of His
care, and hast heard prophets, and apostles, and hast been
instructed by actual events; 
<pb n="378" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_378.html" id="xix.vii-Page_378" />hast yet no emulation to reach the same measure
of virtue as these did! Great assuredly was their virtue! but
greater by far was the mercy of God! and this may be seen from the
very greatness of the threat. For this reason God did not add to
the declaration, “But if ye repent. I will spare:” in order
that by setting forth a sentence without limitation, He might
increase the fear and having increased the fear, He might constrain
them more speedily to repentance.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.vii-p63">18. The prophet is indeed ashamed, foreseeing
what the issue would be, and conjecturing that what he had
prophesied, would remain unaccomplished; God however is not
ashamed, but is desirous of one thing only, viz. the salvation of
men, and corrects His own servant. For when he had entered the
ship, He straightway there raised a boisterous sea; in order that
thou mightest know that where sin is, there is a tempest; where
there is disobedience, there is the swelling of the waves.<note place="end" n="1270" id="xix.vii-p63.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.vii-p64"> κλυδώνιον.</p></note> The city
was shaken because of the sins of the Ninevites; and the ship was
shaken because of the disobedience of the prophet. The sailors
therefore threw Jonah in the deep, and the ship was preserved. Let
us then drown our sins, and our city will assuredly be safe! Flight
will certainly be no advantage to us; for it did not profit him; on
the contrary, it did him injury. He fled from the land indeed, but
he fled not from the wrath of God; he fled from the land, but he
brought the tempest after him on the sea; and so far was he from
obtaining any benefit by his flight, that he plunged those also who
received him into the extremest peril. And whilst he sat sailing in
the ship, although the sailors, the pilots, and all the necessary
apparatus of the ship were there present, he was placed in the
utmost danger. After, however, having been thrown out into the
deep, and having put away his sin by means of the punishment, he
had been conveyed into that unstable<note place="end" n="1271" id="xix.vii-p64.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.vii-p65"> ‡τερμ€τιστον, this word means “vast,”
“immeasurable,” and does not suit the sense: 
‡νερμ€τιστον is undoubtedly the
right reading, unless indeed St. Chrysostom used one for the other,
as Suidas. Hesychius gives it “without ballast,” and so
Aristotle ›ρματίζειν, but Il. i. 486, 
œρματα are props used on
shore.</p></note> vessel, I mean, the whale’s
belly, he enjoyed great security. This was for the purpose of
teaching thee, that as no ship can be of any use to him who is
living in sin, so him who has put away his sin, the sea cannot
drown, nor monsters destroy. Of a truth, the waves received, but
they did not suffocate him. The whale received him, but did not
destroy him; but both the animal and the element gave back to God
unhurt that, with which they were entrusted; and by all these
things the prophet was taught to be humane and merciful; and not to
be more cruel than wild beasts, or thoughtless sailors, or unruly
waves. For even the sailors did not immediately at first give him
up, but after much compulsion; and the sea and the monster guarded
him with great kindness; all these things being under God’s
direction.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.vii-p66">19. Therefore he came back again; he preached;
he threatened; he persuaded; he preserved; he affrighted; he
amended; he established; by one, and that the first preaching! Many
days he needed not, nor continued counsel; but speaking these
simple words only, he brought all to repentance! On this account
God did not lead him directly from the ship into the city; but the
sailors committed him to the sea; the sea to the whale; the whale
to God; God to the Ninevites; and by this long circuit he brought
back the fugitive, that he might instruct all, that it is
impossible to fly from the hands of God; that whithersoever any one
may roam, dragging his sin after him, he will have to undergo a
thousand evils; and though no mortal were present, yet on every
side the whole creation will rise up against him with the utmost
vehemence! Let us not then provide for our safety by flight, but by
a change of the moral character. Is it for remaining in the city
that God is angry with thee, that thou shouldest fly? It is because
thou hast sinned, that He is indignant. Lay aside therefore the
sin, and where the cause of thy wound lies, thence remove<note place="end" n="1272" id="xix.vii-p66.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.vii-p67"> ‡ν€στειλον, divert as a stream. The metaphor is
explained by the sequel, the “wound” meaning an incision made
for surgical purposes.</p></note> the
fountain of the evil. For the physicians too give us directions to
cure contraries by contraries. Is fever, for instance, produced by
a full diet? They subject the disease to the regimen of abstinence.
Does any one fall sick from sadness? They say that mirth is the
suitable medicine for it. Thus also it befits us to act with
respect to diseases of the soul. Hath listlessness excited the
wrath? let us shake this off by zeal, and let us manifest in our
conduct a great change. We have the fast, a very great auxiliary
and ally in our warfare; and besides the fast, we have the
impending distress, and the fear of danger. Now then, in season,
let us be at work on the soul; for we shall easily be able to
persuade it to whatever we choose; since he who is alarmed and
trembling, and set free from all luxury, and who lives in terror,
is able to practise moral wisdom without difficulty, and to receive
the seeds of virtue with much alacrity.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.vii-p68">20. Let us therefore persuade it to make <pb n="379" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_379.html" id="xix.vii-Page_379" />this first change for the
better, by the avoidance of oaths; for although I spake to you
yesterday, and the day before,<note place="end" n="1273" id="xix.vii-p68.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.vii-p69"> This passage will serve to shew, that during the
season of Lent it was the practice to have sermons daily at
Antioch. Bingham has given a variety of quotations to the same
effect. B. xiv. c. iv., sec. 7, vol. iv. p. 536, New Ed.</p></note> on this same subject; yet neither
to-day, nor to-morrow, nor the day after, will I desist giving my
counsel on this subject. And why do I say to-morrow and the day
following? Until I see that you are amended, I will not abstain
from doing so. If those, indeed, who transgress this law, are not
ashamed, far less should we who bid them not transgress it, feel
this frequency of the admonition to be a matter worthy of shame.
For to be continually reminding men of the same topics is not the
fault of the speaker, but of the hearers, needing as they do
perpetual instruction, upon simple and easily-observed precepts.
What indeed is easier than not to swear? It is only a good work of
habit. It is neither labour of the body, nor expenditure of wealth.
Art thou desirous to learn how it is possible to get the better of
this infirmity, how it is possible to be set free from this evil
habit? I will tell thee of a particular method by which if pursued
thou wilt certainly master it. If thou seest either thyself or any
other person, whether it be one of thy servants, or of thy
children, or thy wife, ensnared in this vice; when thou hast
continually reminded them of it, and they are not amended, order
them to retire to rest supperless;<note place="end" n="1274" id="xix.vii-p69.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.vii-p70"> The supper, it should be remembered, was the chief
meal of the day among the Greeks and Romans. And with those who
observed the fast strictly the only meal: see Hom. VI. [6], and
Hom. IV. 12.</p></note> and impose this sentence upon
thyself, as well as upon them, a sentence which will bring with it
no injury, but a gain. For such is the nature of spiritual acts;
they bring profit and a speedy reformation. The tongue when
constantly punished, when straitened by thirst. and pained by
hunger, receives a sufficient admonition, even whilst no one is its
monitor; and though we were the most stupid of mortals, yet when we
are thus reminded by the greatness of the punishment during a whole
day, we shall need no other counsel and exhortation.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.vii-p71">21. Ye have applauded what I have spoken. But
still shew me your applause too by deeds. Else what is the
advantage of our meeting here? Suppose a child were to go to school
every day, yet if he learnt nothing the more for it, would the
excuse satisfy us that he every day went there? Should we not
esteem it the greatest fault, that going there daily, he did it to
no purpose. Let us consider this with ourselves, and let us say to
ourselves, For so long a time have we met together at church,
having the benefit of a most solemn Communion,<note place="end" n="1275" id="xix.vii-p71.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.vii-p72"> συν€ξεως
φρικωδεστ€της. The word σύναξις
is of frequent occurrence in St. Chrysostom, but is of somewhat
ambiguous signification, and means commonly the service of the
Church; but here and in some other passages, it seems to mean the
Communion service. See a passage in Homily IX. on Penitence, where
the same expression receives a most striking commentary.</p></note> which has in it much profit; and
should we return back again just as we came, with none of our
defects corrected, of what advantage is our coming here? For most
actions are done, not for themselves, but for the effects which
follow through their means; as, for example, the sower does not sow
for the mere sake of sowing, but in order that he may reap too;
since if this were not to follow, the sowing would be a loss, the
seeds rotting without any kind of advantage. The merchant doth not
take a voyage merely for sailing’s sake, but that he may increase
his substance by going abroad; since, if this be not attained
beside, extreme mischief will result, and the voyage of merchants
were but for loss. Let us indeed consider this in relation to
ourselves. We also meet together in the church, not for the mere
purpose of spending time here, but in order that we may return
having gained a great and spiritual benefit. Should we then depart
empty, and without having received any advantage, this our
diligence becomes our condemnation! In order that this may not
occur, and extreme mischief result, on departing from this place,
let friends practise with one another; fathers with children; and
masters with servants; and train yourselves to perform the task
assigned you; so that when ye come back again, and hear us giving
you counsel on the same subjects, ye may not be put to shame by an
accusing conscience, but may rejoice and be glad, whilst ye
perceive that ye have accomplished the greatest part of the
admonition.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.vii-p73">22. Let us not moralize on these things here only.
For this temporary admonition does not suffice to extirpate the
whole evil; but at home also, let the husband hear of these things
from the wife, and the wife from the husband. And let there be a
kind of rivalry among all in endeavouring to gain precedence in the
fulfilment of this law; and let him who is in advance, and hath
amended his conduct, reproach him who is still loitering behind; to
the end that he may stir him up the more by these gibes. He who is
deficient, and hath not yet amended his conduct, let him look at
him who hath outstripped him, and strive with emulation to come up
with him quickly. If we take advice on these points, and are
anxiously concerned about <pb n="380" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_380.html" id="xix.vii-Page_380" />them,
our other affairs will speedily be well adjusted. Be thou
solicitous about God’s business, and he will take care of thine!
And do not say to me, “What if any one should impose upon us the
necessity of taking oaths? What if he should not believe us?” For
assuredly, where a law is transgressed, it is improper to make
mention of necessity; forasmuch as there is but one necessity which
cannot be dispensed with, viz. that of not offending God! This,
however, I say further; cut off in the meantime superfluous oaths,
those that are taken uselessly, and without any necessity; those to
your own family, those to your friends, those to your servants; and
should you take away these, you will have no further need of me for
the others. For the very mouth that has been well disciplined to
dread and to avoid the frequent oath, should any one constrain it a
thousand times, would never consent to relapse again into the same
habit. On the contrary, as now, with much labor and vast
importunity, by alarming, threatening, exhorting, and counselling,
we have scarcely been able to bring it over to a different habit,
so in that case, although any one were to impose ever so great
necessity, he could not possibly persuade to a transgression of
this law. And as a person would never choose to take a particular
poison, however urgent the necessity might be, so neither would he
to utter an oath!</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.vii-p74">23. Should this amendment then take place, it
will be an encouragement and inducement to the attainment of the
remaining parts of virtue. For he who has not accomplished anything
at all becomes listless, and quickly falls; but he who is conscious
with himself that he has fulfilled at least one precept, coming by
this to have a good hope, will go on with greater alacrity towards
the rest; so that, after he has reached one, he will presently come
to another; and will not halt until he has attained the crown of
all. For if with regard to wealth, the more any one obtains of it,
the more he desires, much rather may this be seen with reference to
spiritual attainments. Therefore I hasten, and am urgent that this
work may take its commencement, and that the foundation of virtue
may be laid in your souls. We pray and beseech, that ye will
remember these words, not only at the present time, but also at
home, and in the market, and wheresoever ye pass your time. Oh!
that it were possible for me familiarly to converse with you!<note place="end" n="1276" id="xix.vii-p74.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.vii-p75"> St. Chrysostom perhaps here refers to the
interruption of his private pastoral duties, which were occasioned
by the existing calamity. Possibly also to the numbers of his
congregation. See the end of the next Homily. In Hom. LXXXV. on St.
Matt. near the end, he estimates his congregation at 100,000. Ed.
Ben. p. 810.</p></note> then this
long harangue of mine would have been unnecessary. But now since
this may not be, instead of me, remember my words: and while you
are sitting at table, suppose me to enter, and to be standing
beside you, and dinning into you the things I now say to you in
this place. And wheresoever there may be any discourse concerning
me among you, above all things remember this precept, and render me
this recompense for my love toward you. If I see that you have
fulfilled it, I have received my full return, and have obtained a
sufficient recompense for my labours. In order then that ye may
both render us the more active, and that yourselves too may be in
the enjoyment of a good hope; and may provide for the
accomplishment of the remaining precepts with greater facility;
treasure up this precept in your souls with much care, and ye will
then understand the benefit of this admonition. And since a
vestment broidered with gold is a beautiful and conspicuous object,
but seems much more so to us when it is worn upon our own person;
thus also the precepts of God are beautiful when being praised, but
appear far more lovely when they are rightly practised. For now
indeed ye commend what is spoken during a brief moment of time, but
if ye reduce it to practice, you will alike commend both yourselves
and us all day long, and all your lives long. And this is not the
grand point, that we shall praise one another; but that God will
accept us; and not only accept us, but will also reward us with
those gifts that are great and unspeakable! Of which may we all be
deemed worthy, through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord
Jesus Christ, through whom, and with whom, to the Father together
with the Holy Ghost, be glory, now and always, for ever and ever.
Amen.</p>

<p class="c38" id="xix.viii-p2">This Homily is intended to shew that the fear of
Magistrates is beneficial. It also contains an account of what
occurred, during their journey, to those who were conveying the
tidings of the sedition to the Emperor. The case of Jonah is
further cited in illustration. The exhortation on the fear of death
is here continued; and it is shewn, that he who suffers unjustly,
and yet gives thanks to God, by whose permission it happens, is as
one suffering for God’s sake. Examples are again adduced from the
history of the Three Children, and the Babylonian furnace. The
Homily concludes with an address on the necessity of abstaining
from oaths.</p>

<p class="c9" id="xix.viii-p3">1. <span class="c12" id="xix.viii-p3.1">We</span> have spent many
days addressing words of comfort to your Charity. We would not,
however, on that account lay the subject aside; but as long as the
sore of despondency remains, we will apply to it the medicine of
consolation. For if in the case of bodily wounds, physicians do not
give over their fomentations, until they perceive that the pain has
subsided; much less ought this to be done in regard to the soul.
Despondency is a sore of the soul; and we must therefore foment it
continually with soothing words. For not so naturally is warm water
efficacious to soften a hard tumour of the flesh, as words of
comfort are powerful to allay the swelling passions of the soul.<note place="end" n="1277" id="xix.viii-p3.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.viii-p4"> S. Ign. ad Pol. c. 2.</p></note> Here,
there is no need of the sponge as with physician, but instead of
this we employ the tongue. No need of fire here, that we may warm
the water; but instead of fire, we make use of the grace of the
Spirit. Suffer us then to do so to-day. For if we were not to
comfort you, where else could ye obtain consolation? The judges
affright; the priests therefore must console! The rulers threaten;
therefore must the Church give comfort! Thus it happens with
respect to little children. The teachers frighten them, and send
them away weeping to their mothers; but the mothers receiving them
back to their own bosoms, keep them there, embrace them, and kiss
them, while they wipe away their tears, and relieve their sorrowing
spirits; persuading them by what they say, that it is profitable
for them to fear their teachers. Since therefore the rulers also
make you afraid, and render you anxious, the Church, which is the
common mother of us all, opening her bosom, and cradling us in her
arms, administers daily consolation; telling us that the fear of
rulers is profitable, and profitable too the consolation that comes
from hence.<note place="end" n="1278" id="xix.viii-p4.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.viii-p5"><i>i.e</i>., from the Church.</p></note> For the
fear of the former does not permit us to be relaxed by
listlessness, but the consolation of the latter does not allow us
to sink under the weight of sadness; and by both these means God
provides for our safety. He Himself hath armed magistrates with
power; that they may strike terror into the licentious; and hath
ordained His priests that they may administer consolation to those
that are in sorrow.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.viii-p6">2. And both these things are taught us by the
Scripture, and by actual experience of recent events. For if,
whilst there are magistrates and soldiers living under arms, the
madness of a few individuals, a motley crew of adventurers, hath
kindled such a fire among us, in so short a moment<note place="end" n="1279" id="xix.viii-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.viii-p7"> ῥοπῆ.</p></note> of time,
and raised such a tempest, and made us all to stand in fear of
shipwreck, suppose the fear of magistrates to be wholly taken away?
To what lengths would they not have gone in their madness? Would
they not have overthrown the city from its foundations, turning all
things upside down, and have taken our very lives? If you were to
abolish the public tribunals, you would abolish all order from our
life. And even as if you deprive the ship of its pilot, you sink
the vessel; or as, if you remove the general from the army, you
place the soldiers bound in the hands of the enemy; so if you
deprive the city of its rulers, we must lead a life less rational
than that of the brutes, biting and devouring one another; the rich
man, the poorer; the stronger man, the weaker; and the bolder man,
him who is more gentle. But now by the grace of God none of these
things happen. For they who live in a state of piety, require no
correction on the part of the magistrates; for “the law is not
made for a righteous man,”<note place="end" n="1280" id="xix.viii-p7.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.viii-p8"> <scripRef passage="1 Tim. i. 9" id="xix.viii-p8.1" parsed="|1Tim|1|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.1.9">1 Tim. i.
9</scripRef>.</p></note> saith one. But the more numerous
being viciously inclined, if they had no fear of these hanging over
them, would fill the cities with innumerable evils; which Paul
knowing, observed, “There is no power, but <pb n="382" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_382.html" id="xix.viii-Page_382" />of God, the powers that be are

ταῖς οἰκίαις τῶν ξύλων αἱ ἱμαντώσεις, literally,
“strappings of beams;” or “bondings of the timbers.”</p></note> are in
houses, that rulers are in cities; and in the same manner as if you
were to take away the former, the walls, being disunited, would
fall in upon one another of their own accord; so were you to
deprive the world of magistrates, and of the fear that comes of
them, houses at once, and cities, and nations, would fall on one
another in unrestrained confusion, there being no one to repress,
or repel, or persuade them to be peaceful, by the fear of
punishment!</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.viii-p11">3. Let us not then be grieved, beloved, by the
fear of our rulers, but let us give thanks to God that He hath
removed our listlessness, and rendered us more diligent. For tell
me, what harm hath arisen from this concern and anxiety? Is it that
we are become more grave, and gentle; more diligent, and attentive?
that we see no one intoxicated, and singing lascivious airs? Or is
it that there are continual supplications,<note place="end" n="1283" id="xix.viii-p11.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.viii-p12"> λιταὶ.</p></note> and prayers, and tears? that
unseasonable laughter, and impure words, and all dissoluteness is
banished; and that the city is now in all respects, like the
pattern of a modest and virtuous woman? Dost thou grieve, I ask,
for any of these reasons? For these things, assuredly, it were
right to rejoice, and to be thankful to God, that by the terror of
a few days He hath put an end to such stupidity!</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.viii-p13">“Very true,” saith some one, “if our danger
did not go beyond fear, we should have reaped a sufficient benefit;
but we are now in dread lest the mischief should proceed much
farther, and we should be all placed in the extremest peril.”</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.viii-p14">Nevertheless, I say, fear not. Paul comforteth

now, we have sustained a life more grievous than countless deaths;
fearing and trembling during so many days, and being suspicious of
our very shadows; and paying the punishment of Cain; and in the
midst of our sleep, starting up, through constant agony of mind. So
that if we have kindled God’s wrath, we have appeased Him in the
endurance of such a punishment. For if we have not paid the
satisfaction due to our sins, yet it hath been enough to satisfy
the mercy of God.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.viii-p17">4. But not this, but many other grounds for
confidence ought we to have. For God hath already given us not a
few pledges for favourable hopes. And first of all, those who
carried the evil tidings departing hence with the speed of wings,
supposing they should long ere this have reached the camp,<note place="end" n="1286" id="xix.viii-p17.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.viii-p18"> τὸ στρατόπεδον.
The common Lexicons quote only Can. 7, of Sardica for the use of
this word, to signify the court of an Emperor. Due Cange, <i>Gloss.
Med. Gr</i>., shews it to be common, quoting St. Basil, <scripRef passage="Ep. 127" id="xix.viii-p18.1">Ep. 127</scripRef>,

The term is accounted for by the acknowledged dependence of the
Emperors on the army, and their constantly having a strong guard
about them. Compare our expression, “head-quarters” to denote
the seat of government. Theodosius was now at
Constantinople.</p></note> are yet
delayed in the midst of their journey. So many hindrances and
impediments have arisen; and they have left their horses, and are
now proceeding in vehicles; whence their arrival must of necessity
be retarded. For since God here stirred up our priest, and common
father, and persuaded him to go forth, and undertake this embassy,
he detained the messengers for a while, when they were but half way
on their road, lest arriving before him they might kindle the fire,
and make our teacher’s efforts to mend matters useless, when the
royal ears had become inflamed. For that this hindrance on the
road, was not without God’s interposition is evident from this.
Men who had been familiar with such journeys all their lives, and
whose constant business it was to ride on horseback, now broke down
through the fatigue of this very riding; so that what hath now
happened is the reverse of what took place in the case of Jonah.
For God hastened him when unwilling, to go on his mission. But
these, who were desirous to go, He hindered. O strange and
wonderful event! He wished not to preach of an overthrow; and God
forced him to go<note place="end" n="1287" id="xix.viii-p18.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.viii-p19"> ƒν™στησεν.</p></note> against his will. These men with
much haste set forward to be the bearers of a message of overthrow,
and against their will again He has hindered them! For what reason
think you? Why, because in this case the haste was an injury; but
in the other case, haste brought gain. On this account, He hastened
him forward by means of the whale; and detained these by means of
their horses. Seest thou the wisdom of God? Through the very means
by which each party hoped to accomplish their object, through these
each received an hindrance. Jonah expected to <pb n="383" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_383.html" id="xix.viii-Page_383" />escape by the ship, and the ship
became his chain. These couriers, by means of their horses,
expected the more quickly to see the Emperor; and the horses became
the obstacles; or rather, neither the horses in one case, nor the
ship in the other, but the Providence of God everywhere directing
all things according to its own wisdom!</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.viii-p20">5. Consider also His care over us, and how He both
affrighted and consoled us. For after permitting them to set out on
the very day when all these outrages were committed, as if they
would report all that had taken place to the Emperor; He alarmed us
all at their sudden departure. But when they were gone, and two or
three days had elapsed, and we thought the journey of our Priest
would now be useless, as he would arrive when it was too late, He
delivered us from this fear, and comforted us by detaining them, as
I observed, midway; and by providing persons coming to us from
thence by the same road, to announce to us all the difficulties
they had met with on their journey, that we might thus take a
little breath, as indeed we did, and were relieved of a great part
of our anxiety. Having heard of this, we adored God who had done
it, who hath even now more tenderly than any father disposed all
things for us, delaying by some invisible power those evil
messengers, and all but saying to them, “Why do ye hasten? Why do
ye press on, when ye are going to overwhelm so great a city? For
are ye the bearers of a good message to the Emperor? Wait there
till I have made ready my servant, as an excellent physician, to
come up with you and anticipate you in your course.” But if there
was so much of providential care in the first breaking out of this
wound of iniquity, much more shall we obtain a greater freedom from
anxiety, after conversion, after repentance, after so much fear,
after tears and prayers. For Jonah was very properly constrained,
in order that he might be forcibly brought to repentance; but ye
have already given striking evidences of repentance, and
conversion. Therefore, it is necessary that you should receive
consolation, instead of a threatening messenger. For this reason
also hath He sent our common father hence, notwithstanding the many
things to hinder it. But if He had not been tender of our safety,
He would not have persuaded him to this, but would have hindered
him, however disposed he might be to undertake the journey.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.viii-p21">6. There is a third reason by which I may
possibly persuade you to have confidence; I mean, the present
sacred season,<note place="end" n="1288" id="xix.viii-p21.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.viii-p22"> Tillemont, <i>Theodos</i>. art. vi.,
mentions a law of his against holding criminal processes in Lent,
and one deferring all executions thirty days. The massacre of
Thessalonica, for which St. Ambrose caused him to do penance,
occurred after the date of these Homilies, and that event forms a
striking comment on Hom. III. 6. St. Ambrose then required him to
renew the last-mentioned law.</p></note> which
almost all, even unbelievers, respect; but to which this our
divinely-favoured Emperor has shewn such reverence and honour, as
to surpass all the Emperors who have reigned with a regard for
religion before him. As a proof of this, by sending a letter on
these days in honour of the feast, he liberated nearly all those
who were lodged in prison; and this letter our Priest when he
arrives will read to him; and remind him of his own laws, and will
say to him, “Do thou exhort thyself, and remember thine own
deeds! Thou hast an example for thy philanthropy at home! Thou
didst choose to forbear from executing a justifiable slaughter, and
wilt thou endure to perpetrate one that is unjust. Reverencing the
feast, thou didst discharge those who had been convicted and
condemned; and wilt thou, I ask, condemn the innocent, and those
who have not committed any violence, and this when the sacred
season is present? That be far from thee, O Emperor! Thou, speaking
by this Epistle to all the cities, didst say, ‘Would it were
possible for me to raise even the dead.’ This philanthropy and
these words we now stand in need of. To conquer enemies, doth not
render kings so illustrious, as to conquer wrath and anger; for in
the former case, the success is due to arms and soldiers; but here
the trophy is simply thine own, and thou hast no one to divide with
thee the glory of thy moral wisdom. Thou hast overcome barbarian
war, overcome also Imperial wrath! Let all unbelievers learn that
the fear of Christ is able to bridle every kind of authority.
Glorify thy Lord by forgiving the trespasses of thy
fellow-servants; that He also may glorify thee the more; that at
the Day of Judgment, He may bend on thee an Eye merciful and
serene, being mindful of this thy lovingkindness!” This, and much
more, he will say, and will assuredly rescue us from the
Emperor’s wrath. And not only will this fast be of the greatest
assistance to us in influencing the Emperor in our favour, but also
towards enduring what befalls us with fortitude; for we reap no
small consolation from this season. For our very meeting together
daily as we do, and having the benefit of hearing the divine
Scriptures; and beholding each other; and weeping with each other;
and praying, and receiving Benedictions,<note place="end" n="1289" id="xix.viii-p22.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.viii-p23"> εὐλογίας. This
word, rendered <i>benedictionem</i> by the Latin translator, meant
according to Bingham the very same as the Eucharist in the more
ancient writers, and is always so applied by Cyril of Alexandria,
and Chrysostom. In after times, he further observes, that this term
was applied to portions of bread blessed, but distinct from the
Eucharist (being the residue of that brought for consecration),
which was given to those who were not prepared to communicate, b.
xv., c. iv., sec. 3, vol. v., p. 155, new Ed. The term was
evidently derived from the Apostolic phraseology, τὸ ποτήριον τῆς εὐλογίας, <scripRef passage="1 Cor. x. 16" id="xix.viii-p23.1" parsed="|1Cor|10|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.10.16">1 Cor. x. 16</scripRef>. It
is used in the plural, for portions of the consecrated bread, both
at communion, and when reserved to be sent to the sick, or to other
churches.</p></note> and so 
<pb n="384" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_384.html" id="xix.viii-Page_384" />departing home, takes off the chief part of our
distress.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.viii-p24">7. Let us, therefore, not despond, nor give
ourselves up by reason of our distress; but let us wait, expecting
a favourable issue; and let us give heed to the things that are now
about to be spoken. For it is my purpose to discourse to you again
to day respecting contempt for death. I said to you, yesterday,
that we are afraid of death, not because he is really formidable;
but because the love of the kingdom hath not kindled us, nor the
fear of hell laid hold of us; and because besides this we have not
a good conscience. Are you desirous that I should speak of a fourth
reason for this unseasonable distress, one which is not less,<note place="end" n="1290" id="xix.viii-p24.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.viii-p25"> M. (and Ben. and Bas. Tr. apparently) read οὐκ žλαττον τῶν προτ™ρων ‡ληθεστ™ραν;

comparative, however, seems unusual.</p></note> and truer
than the rest? We do not live with the austerity that becometh
Christians. On the contrary, we love to follow this voluptuous and
dissolute and indolent life; therefore also it is but natural that
we cleave to present things; since if we spent this life in
fastings, vigils, and poverty of diet, cutting off all our
extravagant desires; setting a restraint upon our pleasures;
undergoing the toils of virtue; keeping the body under<note place="end" n="1291" id="xix.viii-p25.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.viii-p26"> ὑπωπι€ζων, the same word as used by St. Paul,

way, we should soon be earnestly desirous of future things, and
eager to be delivered from our present labours. And to prove that
what I say is not untrue, ascend to the tops of the mountains, and
observe the monks who are there; some in sackcloth; some in bonds;
some in fastings; some shut up<note place="end" n="1293" id="xix.viii-p27.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.viii-p28"> This word may perhaps belong to the whole series
of penances. St. Chrysostom is not recommending such austerities at
all, but urging them to imitate in some measure a life which they
already honored and esteemed holy. See on <scripRef passage="Rom. xiv. 23" id="xix.viii-p28.1" parsed="|Rom|14|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.14.23">Rom. xiv. 23</scripRef>, Hom. XXVI.

hermits. Also on <scripRef passage="Rom. viii. 11" id="xix.viii-p28.2" parsed="|Rom|8|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.8.11">Rom. viii. 11</scripRef>, Hom. XIII. Mor. Tr. p. 229.</p></note> in darkness. Thou wilt then
perceive, that all these are earnestly desiring death, and calling
it rest. For even as the pugilist is eager to leave the stadium, in
order that he may be freed from wounds; and the wrestler longs for
the theatre to break up, that he may be released from his toils; so
also he who by the aid of virtue leads a life of austerity, and
mortification, earnestly longs for death in order that he may be
freed from his present labours, and may be able to have full
assurance in regard to the crowns laid up in store, by arriving in
the still harbour, and migrating to the place where there is no
further apprehension of shipwreck. Therefore, also, hath God
provided for us a life that is naturally laborious and troublesome;
to the end that being here urged by tribulation, we may conceive an
eager longing for future blessings; for if now, whilst there are so
many sorrows, and dangers, and fears, and anxieties, surrounding us
on all sides, we thus cling to the present life; when should we
ever be desirous of the life to come, if our present existence were
altogether void of grief and misery?</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.viii-p29">8. Thus also God acted towards the Jews. For
wishing to infuse into them a desire of returning (to Canaan), and
to persuade them to hate Egypt, He permitted them to be distressed
by working in clay, and brick-making, that being oppressed by that
weight of toil and affliction, they might cry unto God respecting
their return. For if, indeed when they departed after these things
had happened, they did again remember Egypt, with their hard
slavery, and were urgent to turn back to that former tyranny; what
if they had received no such treatment from these barbarians? when
would they have ever wished to leave that strange land?<note place="end" n="1294" id="xix.viii-p29.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.viii-p30"> <scripRef passage="Numb. xi. 5, xiv. 4" id="xix.viii-p30.1" parsed="|Num|11|5|0|0;|Num|14|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Num.11.5 Bible:Num.14.4">Numb. xi.

end, therefore, that we may not be too closely attached to the
earth, and grow wretched whilst gaping after present things, and
become unmindful of futurity, God hath made our lives here full of
labour. Let us not then cherish the love of the present life beyond
what is necessary. For what doth it profit us? or what is the
advantage of being closely rivetted to the desire of this present
state? Art thou willing to learn in what respect this life is
advantageous? It is so, inasmuch as it is the ground-work and
starting point of the life to come; the wrestling-school and the
arena for crowns of victory hereafter! so that if it does not
provide these for us, it is worse than a thousand deaths. For if we
do not wish to live so as to please God, it is better to die. For
what is the gain? What have we the more? Do we not every day see
the same sun, and the same moon, the same winter, the same summer,
the same course of things? “The thing that hath been, shall be;
and that which is done, is that which shall be done.”<note place="end" n="1295" id="xix.viii-p30.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.viii-p31"> <scripRef passage="Eccles. i. 9" id="xix.viii-p31.1" parsed="|Eccl|1|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Eccl.1.9">Eccles.

thanks to God who permits it, is not inferior to him who sustains
these trials for God’s sake. The blessed Job is a proof of this,
who received so many intolerable wounds through the devil’s
plotting against him uselessly, vainly, and without cause. Yet,
nevertheless, because he bore them courageously, and gave thanks to
God who permitted them, he was invested with a perfect<note place="end" n="1298" id="xix.viii-p34.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.viii-p35"> ὁλόκληρον. He seems to mean a reward as full as

not sad then on account of death; for it is natural to die: but
grieve for sin; because it is a fault of the will. But if thou
grievest for the dead, mourn also for those who are born into the
world; for as the one thing is of nature, so is the other too of
nature. Should any one, therefore, threaten thee with death, say to
him, “I am instructed by Christ not to ‘fear them which kill
the body, but are not able to kill the soul.’”<note place="end" n="1299" id="xix.viii-p35.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.viii-p36"> <scripRef passage="Matt. x. 28" id="xix.viii-p36.1" parsed="|Matt|10|28|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.10.28">Matt. x.

Therefore we should fear none of these things which are brought on
us by the order of nature, but those which are engendered by our
own evil will; for these bring forth our penalty. But let us
continually consider this, that as regards the events which come
upon us unexpectedly we shall not mend them by grieving, and so we
shall cease to grieve.</p>

again, that if we suffer any evil unjustly, during the present
life, we discharge a multitude of sins. Therefore it is a great
advantage to have out the chastisement of our sins here, and not

them will be able to smite us; but not flying from these, though we
ascend to the very summit of the mountains, we shall there find
innumerable enemies! Let us again call to mind those three
children, who were in the midst of the furnace, yet suffered no
evil, and those who cast them into it, how they that sat around
were all consumed. What is more wonderful than this? The fire freed
those it held possession of, and violently seized those whom it did
not hold, to teach thee, that not the habitation, but the habit of
life, bringeth safety or punishment. Those within the furnace
escaped, but those without were consumed. To each alike were the

change? Thou sawest those without destroyed, and dost thou call on
those within? Whence hath it come to pass that thou art grown wise
in such matters. Thou seest how great a change took place in the
monarch! Whilst he had not yet exercised his power over them, he
blasphemed, but as soon as he had cast them into fire, he began to
shew moral wisdom. For this reason also God permitted all to take
place, whatsoever the tyrant wished, in order that He might make it
manifest, that none will be able to injure those who are kept by
Him. And what He did towards Job, He performed here. For on that
occasion also, He permitted the devil to manifest all his power;
and not till he had exhausted all his darts, and no further mode of
plotting against him remained, was the combatant led out of the
field, that the victory might be brilliant and indubitable. So here
too He did the very same thing. He willed to overthrow their city,
and God stayed him not: he willed to carry them away captive, and
He hindered him not: he willed to bind them, and He permitted; to
cast them into the furnace, and He allowed it: to heat the flame
beyond its measure, and this too He suffered; and when there was
nothing further left for the tyrant to do, and he had exhausted all
his strength, then God manifested His own power, and the patience
of the youths. Seest thou how God permitted these tribulations even
to the end, that He might shew the assailants the spiritual wisdom
of those whom they assailed, as well as His own providence. Both of
which circumstances also that man then discerned, and cried out,
“Ye servants of the most high God, come forth, and come
hither.”</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.viii-p51">12. But consider thou with me the magnanimity
of the youths; for they neither sprang out before the call, lest
some should suppose they feared the fire; nor when they were called
did they remain within, lest any one should think that they were
ambitious and contentious. “As soon,” say they, “as thou hast
learnt whose servants we are, as soon as thou hast acknowledged our
Lord, we come forth to be heralds to all who are present of the
power of God.” Or rather, not only they themselves, but even the
enemy with his own voice, yea, both orally, and by his epistle,
proclaimed to all men both the constancy of the combatants, and the
strength of Him who presided over the contest. And even as the
heralds, when they proclaim the names of the victorious combatants
in the midst of the theatre, mention also the cities to which they
belong; “such an one, of such a city!” So he too, instead of
their city, proclaimed their Lord, by saying, “Shadrach, Meshach,
and Abednego, ye servants of the most high God, come forth, and
come hither.” What is come to pass, that thou callest them the
servants of God? Were they not thy servants? “Yea,” saith he,
“but they have overthrown<note place="end" n="1312" id="xix.viii-p51.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.viii-p52"> κατ™λυσαν.</p></note> my sovereignty; they have trampled
under foot my pride. They have shown by deeds, that He is their
true Lord. If they were the servants of men, the fire would not
have feared them; the flame would not have made way for them; for
the creation knows nothing of reverencing or honoring the servants
of men.” Therefore again he saith, “Blessed be the God of
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.”</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.viii-p53"><pb n="387" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_387.html" id="xix.viii-Page_387" />13.

contest. “Blessed be God, who hath sent His angel and delivered
His servants.”<note place="end" n="1313" id="xix.viii-p53.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.viii-p54"> <scripRef passage="Dan. iii. 28" id="xix.viii-p54.1" parsed="|Dan|3|28|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Dan.3.28">Dan. iii.

speaks also of the virtue of the combatants. “Because they
trusted in Him, and have changed the king’s word, and have
yielded their bodies, that they might not worship any god except
their own God.” Could anything equal the virtue of this? Before
this, when they said, “We will not serve thy gods,” he was
inflamed more fiercely than the very furnace; but now, when by
their deeds they had taught him this, he was so far from being
indignant, that he praised and admired them, for not having obeyed
him! So good a thing is virtue, that it has even its enemies
themselves to applaud and admire it! These had fought and
conquered, but the vanquished party gave thanks, that the sight of
the fire had not terrified them, but that the hope in their Lord
had comforted them. And He names the God of the whole world after
the three youths, not at all circumscribing His sovereignty, but
inasmuch as these three youths were equivalent to the whole
world.<note place="end" n="1314" id="xix.viii-p54.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.viii-p55"> <scripRef passage="Ecclesiasticus 44.17" id="xix.viii-p55.1" parsed="|Sir|44|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Sir.44.17">Ecclus. xliv. 17</scripRef>, on <scripRef passage="Rom. i. 8" id="xix.viii-p55.2" parsed="|Rom|1|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.1.8">Rom. i. 8</scripRef>, Hom.

reason he both applauds those who had despised him, and passing by
so many governors, kings, and princes, those who had obeyed him, he
stands in admiration of the three captives and slaves, who derided
his tyranny! For they did these things, not for the sake of
contention, but for the love of wisdom; not of defiance, but of
devotion; not as being puffed up with pride, but fired with zeal.
For great indeed is the blessing of a hope in God; which then also
the barbarian learned, and making it manifest that it was from that
source they had escaped the impending peril, he exclaimed aloud:

<p class="c10" id="xix.viii-p57">14. But I say all this now, and select all the
histories that contain trials and tribulations, and the wrath of
kings, and their evil designs, in order that we may fear nothing,
save only offending God. For then also was there a furnace burning;
yet they derided it, but feared sin. For they knew that if they
were consumed in the fire, they should suffer nothing that was to
be dreaded; but that if they were guilty of impiety, they should
undergo the extremes of misery. It is the greatest punishment to
commit sin, though we may remain unpunished; as on the other hand,
it is the greatest honour and repose to live virtuously, though we
may be punished. For sins separate us from God; as He Himself
speaks; “Have not your sins separated between you and Me?”<note place="end" n="1316" id="xix.viii-p57.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.viii-p58"> <scripRef passage="Isa. lix. 2" id="xix.viii-p58.1" parsed="|Isa|59|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.59.2">Isa. lix.

gangrene, punishment is the surgeon’s knife. As then, he who hath
a gangrene, although he is not lanced, hath to sustain the malady,
and is then in the worse condition, when he is not lanced; so also
the sinner, though he be not punished, is the most wretched of men;
and is then especially wretched, when he hath no punishment, and is
suffering no distress. And as those who have a disease of the
spleen, or a dropsy, when they enjoy a plentiful table, and cool
drinks, and a variety of delicacies, and condiments, are then
especially in a most pitiable state, increasing as they do their
disease by luxury; but should they rigorously subject themselves to
hunger and thirst, according to medical laws, they might have some
hope of recovery; so also those who live in iniquity, if they are
punished, may have favourable hopes; but if, together with their
wickedness, they enjoy security and luxury, they become more
wretched than those who cram their bellies, though they are in a
state of dropsy; and so much the more, as the soul is better than
the body. If then thou seest any who are in the same sins, and some
of them struggling continually with hunger, and a thousand ills;
while others are drinking their fill, and living sumptuously, and
gormandizing; think those the better off, who endure sufferings.

misfortunes, but they also depart to the future Judgment, and that

Fathers, that the fire of the day of judgment would cause severe
suffering to some of those who would be finally saved, and that
this might be mitigated by a severe repentance, and in some degree
by suffering here, and by the prayers of others. St. Chrys. on

fire. But in <i>Or. de fun. Pulcheriæ</i>, p. 460, he says,
“Such a soul, having nothing for which to be judged, fears not
<i>Hell</i>, dreads not <i>Judgment</i>. It abides free from fear
and astonishment, no evil conscience causing a fear of <i>
Judgment</i>.” However, St. Chrys. on <scripRef passage="1 Cor. iii. 15" id="xix.viii-p60.3" parsed="|1Cor|3|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.3.15">1 Cor. iii. 15</scripRef>, Hom. IX.

in eternal torment. This last exposition is attributed to “the
Greeks” by Bellarmine, <i>de Purg</i>. lib. i. c. 5, having been
defended by them in the discussion on Purgatory preliminary to the

Let us then say to these, Nevertheless; such a man does not swear:

self-deception, let us not look at the case of those who fall, but
at those who fashion their conduct rightly; and let us endeavour to
carry along with us a memento of the present fast when it is over.
And as it often happens when we have purchased a vestment, or a
slave, or a precious vase, we recall again the time when we did so,
and say to each other, “That slave I purchased at such a
festival; that garment I bought at such a time;” so, in like
manner, if we now reduce to practice this law, we shall say, I
reformed the practice of swearing during that Lent; for till then I
was a swearer; but from barely hearing an admonition, I have
abstained from the sin.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.viii-p67">But “the custom,” it may be objected,
“is a hard thing to be reformed.” I know it is; and therefore
am urgent to throw you into another custom, which is good and
profitable. For when you say, it is difficult for me to abstain
from what is habitual; for that very reason, I say, you should make
haste to abstain, knowing for certain, that if you once<note place="end" n="1323" id="xix.viii-p67.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.viii-p68"> Implied in the aorist, 
ποιήσῃς.</p></note> make
another custom for yourself of not swearing, you will want no
labour afterwards. Which is the more difficult thing; not to swear,
or to remain the whole day without food; and to shrivel up<note place="end" n="1324" id="xix.viii-p68.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.viii-p69"> ταριχεύεσθαι, Dem. adv.
Aristogit. i. 72, of the effect of long imprisonment, lit. “to be

water-drinking, and meagre diet? It is evident that the latter
surpasses the former; yet, notwithstanding, custom has made this
matter so possible and easy of execution, that when the fast comes
round, although any one should exhort a thousand times, or as
frequently constrain and compel one to partake of wine, or taste of
any other of those things which are forbidden during fasts, yet a
man would prefer to suffer anything, rather than touch the
prohibited article of food;<note place="end" n="1325" id="xix.viii-p69.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.viii-p70"> That this strictness was not quite universal
appears from Hom. IX. 1. The feeling there referred to may have
been partly occasioned by this passage.</p></note> and that not for want of relish
for the table, nevertheless, we bear it all with fortitude, from
the habit of our conscience. And the case will be the same in
regard to oaths; and just as if now, any one were to impose ever so
great necessity, you would remain immovable, holding fast the
habit;<note place="end" n="1326" id="xix.viii-p70.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.viii-p71"> <i>i.e</i>., of fasting.</p></note> so also in

not depart from your custom.</p>

all these things with those who are in your house; and as many

with their fingers; and as some, again, when they quit the gardens
to go home, take with them branches of trees, with their fruit upon
them; and as others, moreover, from sumptuous feasts, carry away
leavings of the entertainment for their dependents; so indeed do
thou, departing from hence, take an exhortation home to thy wife,
thy children, and all thine household. For this admonition is more
profitable than the meadow, the garden, or the banquetting table.
These roses never wither; these fruits never drop off; these
dainties never corrupt. The former yield a temporary delight; but
the latter a lasting advantage, not only after this reformation has
taken place, but in the very act of reforming. For think what a
good practice this would be, having dismissed all other matters

table, in the forum, and in your other meetings. Would we give our
attention to these things, we should say nothing of a dangerous or
injurious nature, nor should we sin unwittingly. Giving our leisure
to discourse respecting these things, we should be able to withdraw
our soul even from this despondency that hangs over us, instead of
looking with so much anxiety as we do, whilst we say one to
another, “Hath the Emperor heard what hath happened? Is he
incensed? What sentence hath he pronounced?<note place="end" n="1329" id="xix.viii-p74.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.viii-p75"> ἐψηφίσατο.</p></note> Hath any one petitioned him? What?
Will he himself endure to destroy utterly a city so great and
populous?” Casting these and all such cares upon God, let us be
anxious only as to what He hath commanded! Thus shall we rid
ourselves of all these sorrows; and although ten only among us
should succeed, the ten would quickly become twenty; the twenty
fifty; the fifty a hundred; the hundred a thousand; the thousand
all the city. And just as when ten lamps are lighted, one may
easily fill the whole house with light, so also with respect to
right actions; should only ten act rightly, we shall light up a
general flame throughout the city, to shine forth, and to procure
us safety. For not so naturally does the fire, when it falls upon a
forest, kindle the neighbouring trees successively, as will the
emulation for virtue, when it seizes upon a few minds, be mighty in
its progress to diffuse itself through the whole
community.</p>

translation perhaps ought to be, “These imitators of Paul. Only
let us yield ourselves worthy of such intercession.” This
rendering is confirmed by its agreement with Hom. XLIV. on <scripRef passage="Gen. xix. 29" id="xix.viii-p78.2" parsed="|Gen|19|29|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.19.29">Gen.
xix. 29</scripRef>; Ben. iv. 448, 449. But there is a difficulty in it owing
to the reference to St. Paul’s <i>departure</i>. This may be
explained as a turn of rhetoric. The passage on <scripRef passage="Gen. xix." id="xix.viii-p78.3" parsed="|Gen|19|0|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.19">Gen. xix.</scripRef> does not
define whether saints on earth or above are spoken of; but from
others it is probable he means the latter. The close of the Homily
on St. Meletius, Ben. ii. 522, A. speaks of such intercession, and
that of Hom. <i>in SS. Bernicen and Prosd</i>. Ben. ii. 645, D. of
invoking it. The Homily quoted above, on the intercession of
Abraham, warns men against trusting to prayers of saints so as to
neglect their own life. An expression like that in the text occurs
in a Homily <i>de Sp. Sancto</i>, attributed to St. Chrys. by
Photius, Ben. iii. 799, C.; Origen on <scripRef passage="Cant. ii. 5" id="xix.viii-p78.4" parsed="|Song|2|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Song.2.5">Cant. ii. 5</scripRef>, asserts the

Hom. XXVI. 6, he asks, who doubts it? Hom. I. 7, on Ezekiel, he
invokes an angel, as holding that angels are present, though in a
rhetorical way. Lib. 2, in Job (fin.) sometimes cited as his, is
spurious, and the Com. on Lament. doubtful, and the manner of
invocation looks as if of later date. St. Cyprian, <i>Ep</i>. 57,
<i>ad Cornel. fin</i>. desires that whoever dies first may pray for
the other; and <i>de Hab. Virg. fin.</i> makes a similar request:
and so Theodosia in <i>Euseb. de Mart. Pal</i>. c. 7.</p>

<p class="MsoEndnoteText" id="xix.viii-p79">In the fourth century, the
invocation of departed saints, or prayer to God for their prayers,
becomes common. So Eusebius, on <scripRef passage="Ps. lxxviii." id="xix.viii-p79.1" parsed="|Ps|78|0|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.78">Ps. lxxviii.</scripRef> (79) takes verse 11,
<i>Preserve Thou the sons of the slain</i> (Heb. <i>of death</i>),
<i>i.e</i>., of the martyrs. At the close of his Com. on Isaiah, he
prays just as St. Chrys. in the text. St. Athanas. <i>ad
Marcellin</i>. 31, t. i. p. 1001, says we should sing the Psalms
exactly, “that the inspired writers may know their own words, and
pray with us, or rather, that the Holy Spirit who spoke in them,
hearing the words He dictated to them, may take our part”
(συναντιλ€βηται, Comp. <scripRef passage="Rom. viii. 26" id="xix.viii-p79.2" parsed="|Rom|8|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.8.26">Rom.
viii. 26</scripRef>). A direct address to the Blessed Virgin.....“Queen, and
Mother of God, intercede for us!” is quoted as his (<i>Serm. in
Annunt</i>. t. ii. p. 401), but is spurious, as is there
stated.</p>

<p class="MsoEndnoteText" id="xix.viii-p80">St. James, of Nisibis, Ser. 4,
p. 72, seems to speak of an angel presenting our prayers, which his
editor connects with Tertullian’s <i>Angelus Orationis, de
Or</i>. xii. and 
<scripRef passage="Tob. xii. 12" id="xix.viii-p80.1" parsed="|Tob|12|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Tob.12.12">Tob. xii. 12</scripRef>. St. Hilary, on <scripRef passage="Ps. cxxiv." id="xix.viii-p80.2" parsed="|Ps|24|0|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.24">Ps.
cxxiv.</scripRef> (125) 2, takes the <i>hills</i> (as others constantly
elsewhere), for the saints and angels. On <scripRef passage="Matt. xxv." id="xix.viii-p80.3" parsed="|Matt|25|0|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.25">Matt. xxv.</scripRef> p. 736, he
says, “none shall be helped by another’s works and merits,
because every one must buy oil for his own lamp.” This seems to
imply the existence of the same tendency which St. Chrysostom
reproves, as quoted above on <scripRef passage="Gen. xix." id="xix.viii-p80.4" parsed="|Gen|19|0|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.19">Gen. xix.</scripRef> The Martyr Justina, early in
this century, is said by St. Greg. Naz. <i>Or</i>. xviii. p. 279
(Ben. Or. xxiv. 11, p. 443 d.), to have implored the aid of the
Virgin Mary.</p>

<p class="MsoEndnoteText" id="xix.viii-p81">In the latter part of the
century, instances are more frequent. St. Cyril of Jerusalem, <i>
Cat. Myst</i>. v. (6), says, “Then we commemorate also those who
have fallen asleep before us, first, patriachs, prophets, apostles,
martyrs, that at their prayers and intervention God would receive
our petition.” St. Basil, Hom. on the Forty Martyrs, c. 8, t. 2,
p. 155, speaks strongly of the value of their intercession, and
recommends asking it. “Here is found a pious woman praying for
her children, the return of her husband, his recovery when sick:
let your prayers be made with the martyrs!” To Julian the
Apostate, <scripRef passage="Ep. 360" id="xix.viii-p81.1">Ep. 360</scripRef>, al. 205, Ben. iii. 462. “I also receive the
holy apostles, prophets, and martyrs, and call on them to
supplication unto God, that through them, that is, through their
mediation, the merciful God may become propitious to me, and a
ransom of my sins may be made and granted.” To St. Ambrose, <scripRef passage="Ep. 197" id="xix.viii-p81.2">Ep.
197</scripRef>, al. 55, Ben. iii. 288, he speaks of the relics of a martyr as
protection to those who kept them. St. Ephraim, in <i>Martyres</i>,
t. iii. Gr. Lat. p. 251, has, “Victorious Martyrs, willing
sufferers for the love of your God and Saviour, ye that have
boldness of speech toward the Lord Himself; intreat, holy as ye
are, for us that are worthless, and sinners, and full of
listlessness, that the grace of Christ may come upon us.” Some
prayers to the Blessed Virgin, calling her the only hope of
sinners, and giving her the titles of our Lord, are ascribed to
him. Such would stand alone in this age, and long after. But one
which has been long known in Latin (ed. Voss, p. 543), has been
generally thought spurious. The last Roman Edition contains more,
but even the <span class="c12" id="xix.viii-p81.3">mss</span>. from which they are
taken seem to ascribe them but doubtfully to him (“Prayers
collected from Holy Scripture, but most of them from St.
Ephraim,” &amp;c.), especially as others precede these. He,
however, used invocation freely, though some allowance must be made
for his rich imagination, and his fondness for apostrophe. Thus he
apostrophises Faith, <i>adv. Scrut. Ser</i>. vi. Gr. Lat. iii. 160,
161. “O Faith! I pray Thee adapt Thy vastness to our littleness!
for while we may not see and measure thee, love can neither rest
nor be silent!” “Come hither, O Faith, Gift of God to the Holy
Church, and rest in this bosom!” Several spurious passages, as
from the Christus Patiens attributed to St. Greg. Naz. l. 2582 (but
rejected and objected to by the Ben. editor), are examined by Mr.
Palmer, Letter v. to Dr. Wiseman. The real practice of St. Greg.
Naz. appears in his funeral oration on St. Basil, <i>Or</i>. xx.
fin. p. 373 (Ben. xliii. 82, p. 831). “But do thou, O divine and
sacred head, look on us from above, and either remove by the
intercessions the thorn in the flesh that chastises us, or persuade
us to bear it with fortitude,” &amp;c. <i>Or</i>. vi. <i>ad Greg.
Nyss</i>. p. 140 (Ben. xi. 5, p. 245), he says, that martyrs are
“Mediators for attaining a divine state” (θ™ωσις). St. Chrysostom is of the same
date. St. Greg. Nyss. on St. Theodorus, speaks repeatedly of asking
his intercession. “To touch his relics, if any chance give one
the opportunity…Then, shedding on them the tear of piety and
affection, as though to the martyr, appearing in full presence,
they present their entreaty for intercession; beseeching him, as an
attendant* upon God, and invoking him as one who obtains favors at
will,” t. iii. p. 580, and so in other parts of the oration; and
in p. 586, he begs him, if need be, to call his brother-martyrs to
his aid. And in the close of his life of St. Ephraim, he both
invokes him, “Remember us all, asking remission for our sins;”
and speaks of a person having invoked his help, in circumstances of
danger, with success. St. Ambrose, <i>de Vid</i>. c. 9, says,
“The angels are to be entreated for us, who are given us for our
guard; the martyrs are to be entreated, whose patronage we may in a
manner claim by the pledge of their bodies. They can pray for our
sins, who have washed in their own blood their own sins, if such
they had.” These are most of the authors alleged down to the end
of the fourth century, but in most of the later of them other
passages of the same kind appear. Thus the practice of direct
invocation seems to have come in by degrees, and that chiefly in
the course of this century. Some passages relating merely to the
intercession of the saints have been passed over, as they would
rather confuse the view of the subject of <i>seeking</i> it.
Bellarmine, <i>De Sanctis</i>, l. i. c. 19, and Coccius, <i>
Thesaur</i>. l. v., art. 4, give collections of passages. See on
Fleury, Book 19, c. 31, Tr. p. 202, note k.</p>

discoursed unto your Charity in many words, and upon many subjects;
and if out of this variety, it be not possible for you to retain
all, I wish more particularly to recall to memory the observation,
that God hath implanted the affection grief in our natures for no
other reason but because of sin, and He hath made this evident from
actual experience. For whilst we are grieved and distressed through
the loss of wealth; or by reason of sickness, and death, and the
other evils that befall us, we not only reap no consolation from
our sorrow, but we also increase the force of these calamities. But
if we are in pain and sorrow<note place="end" n="1332" id="xix.ix-p3.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.ix-p4"> St. Greg. Nyss. <i>de Beat</i>. iii. t. i.

weight of sin; we make that little which is great; and very often
we blot it all out entirely. Ye should continually remember this, I
repeat, in order that ye may mourn for sin only, and for nothing
besides; and the additional fact, that sin, though it brought death
and sadness into our life, is again destroyed<note place="end" n="1333" id="xix.ix-p4.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.ix-p5"> Or. <i>in funere Pulcheriæ</i>, t. iii.

recently made evident. Therefore, let us fear nothing so much as
sin and transgression. Let us not fear punishment, and then we
shall escape<note place="end" n="1334" id="xix.ix-p5.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.ix-p6"> διαφευξόμεθα</p></note>
punishment. Even as the Three Children were not afraid of the
furnace, and so escaped from the furnace. Such indeed it becomes
the servants of God to be. For if those who were brought up under

did, now when death is only a name, devoid of reality. For death is
nothing more than a sleep, a journey, a migration, a rest, a
tranquil haven; an escape from trouble, and a freedom from the
cares of this present life!</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.ix-p10">2. But here let us dismiss the subject of
consolation; it is the fifth day we are engaged in speaking words
of comfort to your Charity, and we might now seem to be
troublesome. For what hath been already said is sufficient <pb n="391" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_391.html" id="xix.ix-Page_391" />for those who give heed; but to
those who are pusillanimous it will be no gain, even though we were
to add to what we have said. It is now time to direct our teaching
to the exposition of the Scriptures. For as, if we had said nothing
in reference to the present calamity, one might have condemned us
for cruelty, and a want of humanity; so, were we always discoursing
of this, we might justly be condemned for pusillanimity. Commending
then your hearts to God, who is able to speak<note place="end" n="1338" id="xix.ix-p10.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.ix-p11"> See <scripRef passage="Isa. xl. 2" id="xix.ix-p11.1" parsed="|Isa|40|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.40.2">Isa.
xl. 2</scripRef>, Heb. and LXX.</p></note> into your minds, and to expel all
grief from within, let us now take up our accustomed manner of
instruction; and that especially since every exposition of
Scripture is matter of comfort and relief. So that, although we may
seem to be desisting from the topic of consolation, we shall again
light upon the same subject by means of Scriptural exposition. For
that all Scripture furnishes consolation to those who give
attention to it, I will make manifest to you from its own
evidence.<note place="end" n="1339" id="xix.ix-p11.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.ix-p12"> αὐτόθεν.</p></note> For I
shall not go about among the Scripture narratives to search out
certain arguments consolatory; but in order that I may make the
proof of the matter which I have undertaken plainer, we will take
in hand the book which has to day been read to us; and bringing
forward, if you will, the introduction and commencement of it,
which may especially seem to present no trace of consolation, but
to be altogether foreign to topics of comfort, I will make that
which I affirm evident.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.ix-p13">3. What then is this introduction? “In the
beginning God made the heaven and the earth, and the earth was
invisible, and unformed,<note place="end" n="1340" id="xix.ix-p13.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.ix-p14"> Or, <i>unfurnished</i>, E.V., <i>without

words seem to some of you incapable of affording consolation under
distress? Is it not an historical narrative, and an instruction
about the creation?</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.ix-p16">Would you then that I show the consolation
that is hidden in this saying? Arouse yourselves then, and attend
with earnestness to the things which are about to be spoken. For
when thou hearest that God made the heaven, the earth, the sea, the
air, the waters, the multitude of stars, the two great lights, the
plants, the quadrupeds, the swimming and the flying animals, and
all things without exception which thou seest, for thee, and for
thy safety and honour; dost thou not straightway take comfort and
receive this as the strongest proof of the love of God, when thou
thinkest that He produced such a world as this, so fair, so vast
and wonderful, for such a puny being as thyself! When therefore
thou hearest that, “In the beginning God made the heaven and the
earth,” run not hastily over the declaration; but traverse in thy
mind the breadth of the earth; and reflect how He hath spread out<note place="end" n="1342" id="xix.ix-p16.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.ix-p17"> ‡νῆκεν, “sent up,” <i>i.e</i>.,

marvellous thing, that He gave us not such a world as this in
payment for services done; or as a recompense for good works; but
at the very time He formed us, He honoured our race with this
kingdom. For He said, “Let us make man after our image, and after
our likeness.”<note place="end" n="1344" id="xix.ix-p18.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.ix-p19"> <scripRef passage="Gen. i. 26" id="xix.ix-p19.1" parsed="|Gen|1|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.1.26">Gen. i.

implies, an <i>intrinsic</i> resemblance. See St. Cyr. <i>Cat</i>.
xii. (3), and xiv. (5); St. Aug. <i>De C. D</i>. xi. 26, xii. 23;
<i>Conf</i>. xiii. 12; St. Greg. Nyss. on the text, t. ii. p. 22
sqq.</p></note> is that
which is meant; and as there is no one in heaven superior to God,
so let there be none upon earth superior to man. This then is one,
and the first respect, in which He did him honour; by making him
after His own image; and secondly, by providing us with this
principality, not as a payment for services, but making it entirely
the gift of His own love toward man; and thirdly, in that He
conferred it upon us as a thing of nature. For of governments there
are some natural, and others which are elective;—natural as of
the lion over the quadrupeds, or as that of the eagle over the
birds; elective, as that of an Emperor over us; for he doth not
reign over his fellow-servants by any natural authority. Therefore
it is that he oftentimes loses his sovereignty. For such are things
which are not naturally inherent;<note place="end" n="1346" id="xix.ix-p20.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.ix-p21"> So “nature” was usually understood.
Arist. Eth. ii. 1. “Nothing that is by nature is made otherwise
by habit; <i>e.g</i>., a stone tends downwards by nature, and
cannot be habituated to tend upwards.”</p></note> they readily admit of change and
transposition. But not so with the lion; he rules by nature over
the quadrupeds, as the eagle doth over birds. The character of
sovereignty is, therefore, constantly allotted to his race; and no
lion hath ever been seen deprived of it. Such a kind of sovereignty
God bestowed upon us from the beginning, and set us over all
things. And not only in this respect did He confer honour upon our
nature,<note place="end" n="1347" id="xix.ix-p21.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.ix-p22"> Or, kind.</p></note> but also,
by the very eminence of the spot in which we <pb n="392" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_392.html" id="xix.ix-Page_392" />were placed, fixing upon Paradise as
our choice dwelling, and bestowing the gift of reason, and an
immortal soul.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.ix-p23">4. But I would not speak of these things: for
I say that such was the abundance of God’s care, that we may know
His goodness, and His love towards man, not only from the way in
which He hath honoured, but also from the way in which He hath
punished us. And this, I especially exhort you to consider with
attention, that God is alike good, not only whilst He is treating
us with honour and beneficence, but also whilst He is punishing and
chastising. And whether we should have to carry on our contest and
combat against the heathen, or against the heretics, respecting the
lovingkindness and goodness of God, we shall make His goodness
evident, not only from the cases in which He bestows honour, but
also from the cases in which He inflicts punishment. For if He is
good only whilst honouring us, and not good whilst punishing us, He
were but half good. But this is not the case. God forbid! Among men
this may probably happen, when they inflict punishments in anger
and passion; but God being free from passion, whether He exercise
kindness, or whether He punish, He is alike good. Nor less does the
threat of hell serve to show His goodness, than the promise of the
kingdom.<note place="end" n="1348" id="xix.ix-p23.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.ix-p24"> <scripRef passage="Gal. iii. 24" id="xix.ix-p24.1" parsed="|Gal|3|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gal.3.24">Gal. iii.
24</scripRef>.</p></note> But how? I
answer. If He had not threatened hell, if He had not prepared
punishment, there are not many who would have attained the
kingdom.<note place="end" n="1349" id="xix.ix-p24.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.ix-p25"> <scripRef passage="1 Tim. i. 9" id="xix.ix-p25.1" parsed="|1Tim|1|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.1.9">1 Tim. i.
9</scripRef>. St. Greg. Nyss.
on the Beatitudes, <i>Or</i>. 3, t. i. p. 781, explains <i>Blessed
are they that mourn</i>; first, of those whom the fear of hell
causes to mourn for their sins; secondly, of those who mourn for
their present exclusion from the good things they hope for
hereafter. See on <scripRef passage="Rom. xiv. 13" id="xix.ix-p25.2" parsed="|Rom|14|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.14.13">Rom. xiv. 13</scripRef>, Hom. XXV.</p></note> For the
promise of good things doth not so strongly induce the multitude to
virtue; as doth the threat of evil things compel by fear, and
arouse them to the care of the soul. So that, although hell be the
opposite of the kingdom of heaven, yet each hath respect to the
same end—the salvation of men; the one alluring to itself, the
other driving them towards its opposite, and by the operation of

<p class="c10" id="xix.ix-p26">5. I do not enlarge upon this subject without
reason; but because there are many who often, when famines, and
droughts, and wars take place, or when the wrath of an Emperor
overtakes them, or when any other unexpected events of this kind
happen, deceive the simpler class by saying, that these things are
unworthy of the Providence of God.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.ix-p27">I am therefore compelled to dwell on this part
of my discourse, that we may not be beguiled by words, but that we
may plainly perceive, that whether He brings upon us a famine, or a
war, or any calamity, whatsoever, He doth it out of His exceeding
great care and kindness. For even those fathers, who especially
love their offspring, will forbid them the table, and inflict
stripes, and punish them by disgrace, and in endless other ways of
this kind correct their children when they are disorderly; yet are
they nevertheless fathers, not only while doing them honour, but
when acting thus; yea, they are preeminently fathers when they act
thus.<note place="end" n="1350" id="xix.ix-p27.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.ix-p28"> <scripRef passage="Heb. xii. 9" id="xix.ix-p28.1" parsed="|Heb|12|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Heb.12.9">Heb. xii.

men, who are frequently carried away beyond what is meet by the
force of angry feelings, are yet held to punish those whom they
love, not from cruelty and inhumanity, but from a kind care and
regard; much rather is it proper to be thus minded concerning God;
who in the exceeding abundance of His goodness, far transcends
every degree of paternal fondness. And that you may not suppose
that what I say is a mere conjecture, let us, I pray you, direct
our discourse to the Scripture itself. When man, then, had been
deceived and beguiled by the wicked demon, let us observe how God
treated him, after his committing so great a sin. Did He then
altogether destroy him? Yet the reason of the thing in justice
demanded this, that one who had displayed nothing that was good,
but, after enjoying so much favour, had waxed wanton even from the
very first, should be made away with, and utterly destroyed; yet
God acted not so; neither did He regard with disgust and aversion
him who had been so ungrateful towards his Benefactor, but He comes
to him as a physician cometh to a sick man.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.ix-p29">6. Do not, O beloved, pass over unthinkingly,
what has just been said! but consider what an act it was, not to
send an angel, or archangel, or any other of his fellow-servants,
but that the Lord Himself should have descended to him who had
fallen from the right way, and should have raised him when thus
cast down; and should have approached him, One to one,<note place="end" n="1351" id="xix.ix-p29.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.ix-p30"> μόνον πρὸς μόνον.
There being no third party present.</p></note> as a
friend comes to a friend when he is unfortunate, and is plunged in
great distress! For that He acted thus out of His great kindness,
the very words too which He spake to him evidently show His
ineffable affection. And why do I say, <i>all</i> the words? The
first utterance signifies at once His tenderness. For He said not,
what it was probable a person treated so contemptuously would say,
“O wicked, yea most wicked man! When thou hadst enjoyed so great
favour from Me, and hadst been honoured with such a sovereignty,
being exalted above all the crea<pb n="393" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_393.html" id="xix.ix-Page_393" />tures upon the earth for no
merit of thine own; and having received in actual deeds the pledges
of My care, and a true manifestation of My Providence, didst thou
esteem a wicked and pestiferous demon, the enemy of thy salvation,
to be worthy of more credit than thy Lord and Benefactor? What
proof did he give of regard for thee, like that which I have done?
Did I not make for thee the heaven, the earth, the sea, the sun,
the moon, and all the stars? For truly none of the angels needed
this work of creation; but for thee, and for thy recreation, I made
so great and excellent a world; and didst thou esteem mere words
alone, a false engagement, and a promise full of deceit, as more
worthy to be believed than the kindness and providence that was
manifested by deeds; that thou gavest thyself over to him, and
didst trample My laws under foot!” These words, and more of this
kind, one who had been treated contemptuously would probably say.
But God acted not so; but quite in the contrary manner. For by His
first word He at once raised him up from his dejection, and gave
the fearful and trembling man confidence, by being the first
Himself to call him, or rather, not by merely calling him first,
but by addressing him by his own familiar appellation, and saying,
“Adam, where art thou?” Thus He shewed His tenderness, and the
great regard He had for him. For ye must all know, that this is a
mark of intimate friendship.<note place="end" n="1352" id="xix.ix-p30.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.ix-p31"> Thus Thetis, <i>Il</i>. i. 361, and

dead are wont to do, continually repeating their names. And so, on
the other hand, those who entertain hatred and enmity against any,
cannot bear to mention the very names of those who have aggrieved
them. Saul, for instance, though he had sustained no injury from
David, but had wronged him exceedingly, since he abhorred and hated
him, could not endure to mention his proper name; but when all were
seated together, not seeing David to be present, what said he? He
said not, “Where is David? but, ‘Where is the son of
Jesse?’”<note place="end" n="1353" id="xix.ix-p31.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.ix-p32"> <scripRef passage="1 Kings xx. 27" id="xix.ix-p32.1" parsed="|1Kgs|20|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Kgs.20.27">1 Kings

him by his father’s name. And again, the Jews did the same with
respect to Christ, for since they abhorred and hated Him, they did

that St. Chrysostom supposed the term Christ to have been one of
the familiar names by which our Saviour was known. But the term
Jesus of Nazareth seems to have been His more general and
distinctive appellation; though it by no means follows that He was
not as familiarly known by the title of Christ among His followers,
and addressed as such, especially after Peter’s confession. (See
<scripRef passage="John 4.22; Matt. 27.17,63" id="xix.ix-p33.1" parsed="|John|4|22|0|0;|Matt|27|17|0|0;|Matt|27|63|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.4.22 Bible:Matt.27.17 Bible:Matt.27.63">John iv. 22; Matt. xxvii. 17, contrasted with

<p class="c10" id="xix.ix-p35">7. But God, willing to show even by this that
sin had not quenched His tenderness, nor disobedience taken away
His favor toward him, and that He still exercised His Providence

ignorant of the place where he was, but because the mouth of those
who have sinned is closed up; sin turning the tongue backward, and
conscience taking hold of it; so that such persons remain
speechless, held fast in silence as by a kind of chain. And God
wishing therefore to invite him to freedom of utterance, and to
give him confidence, and to lead him to make an apology for his
offences, in order that he might obtain some forgiveness, was
Himself the first to call; cutting off much of Adam’s distress by
the familiar appellation, and dispelling his fear, and opening by
this address the mouth that was shut. Hence also it was that he
said, “Adam, where art thou?” “I left thee,” saith he,
“in one situation, and I find thee in another. I left thee in
confidence and glory; and I now find thee in disgrace and
silence!” And observe the care of God in this instance. He called
not Eve;—He called not the serpent,—but him who had sinned in
the lightest degree of all, he brings first to the tribunal, in
order that beginning from him who was able to find some degree of
excuse, He might pass a more merciful sentence, even against her
who had sinned the most. And judges, indeed, do not deign to make
inquiry in their own person of their fellow-servants, and those who
are partakers of a common nature with them, but putting forward
some one of their attendants to intervene, they instruct him to
convey their own questions to the criminal; and through him they
say and hear whatever they wish, when they examine the offenders.<note place="end" n="1357" id="xix.ix-p36.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.ix-p37"> What it was to be brought to the bar in those days

wonderful, but also that he corrects the crimes that had been

consider how they may make them better, but how they may make them

demonstrates the care of God, what if we should read through this
whole judgment, and unfold its entire records? Seest thou how all
Scripture is consolation and comfort? But of these records we will
speak at a befitting season; before that, however, it is necessary
to state at what time this Book was given; for these things were

generations afterwards; and it were worth while to enquire for what
reason this delay took place, and why at length they were given to
the Jews only, and not to all men; and why written in the Hebrew
tongue; and why in the wilderness of Sinai? For the Apostle doth
not mention the place merely in a cursory manner; but shews that in
that circumstance too there was a great subject of contemplation
for us, when he saith to us: “For these are two covenants, the
one from Mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage.”<note place="end" n="1361" id="xix.ix-p41.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.ix-p42"> <scripRef passage="Gal. iv. 24" id="xix.ix-p42.1" parsed="|Gal|4|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gal.4.24">Gal. iv.

our purpose to enquire into. But I see that the time doth not
permit us to launch our discourse upon so wide a sea; wherefore
prudently reserving these to a fit season, we would again address
you on the subject of abstinence from oaths; and we would entreat
your Charity to use much diligence respecting this matter. For what
is it but an absurdity, that not even a servant dares to call his
master by name, nor to mention him unceremoniously, and casually,
but that he should everywhere bandy about the name of the Lord of
Angels familiarly with much irreverence! And if it be necessary to
take the book of the Gospel, thou receivest it with hands that have
been first washed; and fearfully and tremblingly, with much
reverence and devotion; and dost thou unceremoniously bandy about
upon thy tongue the Lord of the Gospel? Dost thou desire to learn
how the Powers above pronounce that Name; with what awe, with what
terror, with what wonder? “I saw the Lord,” saith the prophet,
“sitting upon a throne, high, and lifted up; around Him stood the
Seraphim; and one cried unto another, and said, Holy, Holy, Holy,
Lord God of Sabaoth; the whole earth is full of His glory!”<note place="end" n="1362" id="xix.ix-p43.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.ix-p44"> <scripRef passage="Is. vi. 3" id="xix.ix-p44.1" parsed="|Isa|6|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.6.3">Is. vi.

thou, with what dread, with what awe, they pronounce that Name,
whilst glorifying and praising Him? But thou, in thy prayers and
supplications, callest upon Him with much listlessness; when it
would become thee to be full of awe, and to be watchful and sober!
But in oaths, where it is wholly unsuitable that this wonderful
Name should be introduced, there thou makest a long string of
divers forms of imprecation! What pardon then, or what excuse shall
we have, howsoever we may plead this “custom”? It is said, that
a certain heathen orator, by a kind of foolish habit, was
continually moving his right shoulder as he went along.<note place="end" n="1363" id="xix.ix-p44.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.ix-p45"> Demosthenes. Libanius says that it was in
speaking he did this, and that he cured himself by hanging a sword
before his shoulder in his private practice. Life of Dem. in <i>

on St. Matt. Hom. XVII. Ben. p. 232a., 
βαδίζων may possibly be applied to the course of a
speech.</p></note> He
conquered this habit, however, by fastening sharp knives on each
side over his shoulders, so that the fear of being cut controlled
the member in its unseasonable movement by fear of the wound! Do
thou too, then, act thus with regard to thy tongue, and instead of
the knife, suspend over it the fear of God’s chastisement, and
thou wilt assuredly get the better! For it seems impossible,
utterly impossible, that those should ever be overcome, who are
solicitous and earnest about this, and really make it their
business.</p>

so despisest Him as to swear even by His glory. “But what shall I
do,” saith one, “with those who impose necessity on me?” What
kind of necessity can there be, O man? Let all men understand that
thou wilt choose to suffer anything rather than transgress the law
of God; and they will abstain from compelling thee. For as a proof
that it is not an oath which rendereth a man worthy of credit, but
the testimony of his life, the uprightness of his conversation, and
his good reputation, many have often split their throats with
swearing, and yet have been able to convince no one; whereas others
by a mere expression of assent, have been esteemed more
deserving <pb n="395" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_395.html" id="xix.ix-Page_395" />of belief than
they who swore never so much. Knowing, therefore, all these things,
and placing before our eyes the punishment that is in store for
those who swear, as well as for those who swear falsely, let us
abstain from this evil custom, that advancing from hence to the
correction of what remains, we may enjoy the blessedness of the
life to come, which God grant that we may all be found worthy to
obtain, by the grace and love toward man of our Lord Jesus Christ,
through Whom and with Whom to the Father with the Holy Ghost be
glory, and power, and honour, now and ever, and world without end.

<p class="c38" id="xix.x-p2">An exhortation to virtue—and particularly upon the
passage, “God was walking in Paradise in the cool of the
day:”—and again on the subject of abstaining from oaths.</p>

<p class="c9" id="xix.x-p3"><span class="c12" id="xix.x-p3.1">Ye</span> have lately heard,
how all Scripture bringeth consolation and comfort, although it be
an historical narrative. For instance, “In the beginning, God
created the heaven and the earth,”<note place="end" n="1366" id="xix.x-p3.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.x-p4"> <scripRef passage="Gen. i. 1" id="xix.x-p4.1" parsed="|Gen|1|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.1.1">Gen. i.
1</scripRef>.</p></note> was an historical declaration; but
it was shewn in our discourse, that this sentence was one pregnant
with comfort; as, for example, that God made us a twofold table,<note place="end" n="1367" id="xix.x-p4.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.x-p5"> τρ€πεζαν, <i>
i.e</i>., of refreshment, as “for thee and for thy recreation,”
Hom. VII. (3). What he says presently of the trees has not occurred
in these Homilies.</p></note> by
spreading out the sea and the land at the same time; by kindling
above the twofold lights, the sun and moon; by determining the
twofold seasons of their course, the day and night, the one for
labour, and the other for rest. For the night ministers to us no
less benefit than the day. But as I said with reference to trees,
those which are barren, rival in their utility those which bear
fruit; since we are thus not necessitated to touch those trees
which are pleasant for food, for the purposes of building. The wild
and untamed animals are also subservient to our need, in no less a
degree than the tame animals; by driving us together, through the
fear of them, into cities; making us more cautious, and binding us
to one another; and by exercising the strength of some, and freeing
others from their sicknesses; for the physicians concoct many
medicines out of these;<note place="end" n="1368" id="xix.x-p5.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.x-p6"> Viz. the wild animals: l. xxviii. of Pliny’s
Natural History is devoted to “medicines from animals.”</p></note> and by reminding us of our ancient
sin. For when I hear it said, “The fear of you, and the dread of
you, shall be upon all the wild beasts of the earth:”<note place="end" n="1369" id="xix.x-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.x-p7"> <scripRef passage="Gen. ix. 2" id="xix.x-p7.1" parsed="|Gen|9|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.9.2">Gen. ix.
2</scripRef>.</p></note> and then
observe, that this honour was afterwards curtailed, I am reminded
of sin, which hath dissipated the fear of us, and undermined our
authority. Thus I become a better and a wiser<note place="end" n="1370" id="xix.x-p7.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.x-p8"> Or, more sober, 
σωφρον™στερος.</p></note> man, whilst I learn the harm that
sin hath occasioned us. As then, what I said was, that the things
alluded to, and others of a similar kind, which God, who is the
Maker, knoweth of, contribute not a little to our present life; so
now also I say, that the night no less than the day brings along
with it its advantage, being a rest from labours, and a medicine
for disease. Often, indeed, physicians, though exerting themselves
in many ways, and preparing an endless variety of remedies, are not
able to deliver the man who is labouring under infirmity. But sleep
coming upon him of its own accord hath entirely removed the
disease, and freed them<note place="end" n="1371" id="xix.x-p8.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.x-p9"> The physicians.</p></note> from an infinite deal of trouble.
Night, again, is not only a medicine for bodily labours, but also
for mental diseases, in giving rest to anguished souls. Ofttimes it
happeneth that some one hath lost a son;<note place="end" n="1372" id="xix.x-p9.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.x-p10"> Comp. Apoll. <i>Rhod. Arg</i>. iii.

relief from the miseries of the day time.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.x-p17">2. And now, I pray you, let us proceed to the
subject which hath given rise to these observations. For well I
know, that ye are all eagerly awaiting this matter; and that each
one of you is in pain till he learn on what account this Book was
not given from the beginning. But even now I do not see that the
<pb n="396" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_396.html" id="xix.x-Page_396" />time is fit for a
discourse on this subject. And why so? Because the week hath nearly
arrived at its close with us, and I fear to touch upon a subject,
the exposition of which I should presently afterwards be obliged to
cut short. For the subject requires of us several days in
succession, and a continuous effort of memory: wherefore we must
again defer it.<note place="end" n="1374" id="xix.x-p17.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.x-p18"> Tillemont places this Homily on Friday, but the
reference to the last is “lately,” not “yesterday,” so that

it not amiss! we will assuredly pay you the debt with interest; for
thus it is expedient both for you, and for us who are to discharge
it. Meanwhile, however, let us now speak on that subject which we
left out yesterday. And what was it we left out yesterday? “God
was walking,” it says, “in Paradise in the cool of the
day.”<note place="end" n="1375" id="xix.x-p18.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.x-p19"> <scripRef passage="Gen. iii. 8" id="xix.x-p19.1" parsed="|Gen|3|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.3.8">Gen. iii.

here meant, I ask? “God was walking!” God was not walking; for
how should He do this who is everywhere present and filleth all
things? But He caused a perception of this sort in Adam, in order
that he might collect<note place="end" n="1376" id="xix.x-p19.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.x-p20"> συστείλῃ. See <scripRef passage="Rom. xii. 1" id="xix.x-p20.1" parsed="|Rom|12|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.12.1">Rom. xii. 1</scripRef>, Hom. XX., where it is used of
reverence.</p></note> himself; that he might not be
careless; that in flying and in hiding himself, he might present
beforehand some portion of the excuse, even before any words had
passed. For even as those who are about to be led to the tribunal,
to sustain the charges respecting the crimes they have committed,
present themselves before those who are to try them with a squalid,
begrimed, sad, and subdued visage, in order that from their
appearance, they may incline them to loving-kindness, mercy, and
forgiveness, so also did it happen in the case of Adam. For it was
necessary that he should be led to this Tribunal in a subdued
state. Therefore God took him beforehand, and humbled him. But that
some one was walking there, he perceived; but whence came he to
suppose that God was walking there? Such is the habitual custom of
those who have committed sin. They are suspicious of all things;
they tremble at shadows; they are in terror at every sound, and
they imagine that every one is approaching them in a hostile
manner. Often therefore the guilty, when they observe people
running on another business, suppose that they are come against
them; and when others are conversing one with another on quite a
different subject, they that are conscious of sin suppose they are
conversing about them.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.x-p21">3. For such is the nature of sin, that it
betrays whilst no one finds fault; it condemns whilst no one
accuses; it makes the sinner a timid being; one that trembles at a

soul clad in rags, squalid, begrimed, and in a more wretched
condition than that of any criminal; and seeing him the captive and
slave of his passions, he despised his power. For he seemed to see
a king but in a scene, 
<pb n="397" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_397.html" id="xix.x-Page_397" />and not a real one. For what was the
advantage of outward abundance, when the poverty within was so
great? And what harm could outward poverty do, when there was such
a treasure of wealth within? Such a lion also was the blessed Paul;
for when he had entered into the prison, and only raised his voice,
he shook all the foundations; he gnawed in pieces<note place="end" n="1385" id="xix.x-p29.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.x-p30"> κατ™φαγεν.</p></note> the
fetters, employing not his teeth, but words; on which account it
were fitting to call such men not merely lions, but something more
than lions; for a lion ofttimes, after he hath fallen into a net,
is taken; but the Saints when they are bound, become still more
powerful; just as this blessed man did then in the prison, having
loosed the prisoners, shaken the walls, and bound the keeper, and
overcome him by the word of godliness. The lion uttereth his voice,
and putteth all the wild beasts to flight. The Saint uttereth his
voice, and driveth away the demons on every side! The weapons of
the lion are a hairy mane, pointed claws, and sharp teeth. The
weapons of the righteous man are spiritual wisdom, temperance,
patience, contempt of all present things. Whoever hath these
weapons shall not only be able to deride wicked men, but even the
adverse powers themselves.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.x-p31">4. Study then, O man, the life according to
God, and no one shall conquer thee at any time; and although thou
mayest be accounted the most insignificant of men, thou shalt be
more powerful than all. On the other hand, if thou art indifferent
about virtue of soul, though thou wert the most powerful of men,
thou wilt easily be worsted by all that assail thee. And the
examples already quoted proved this. But if thou art desirous, I
will also endeavour to teach thee by actual facts<note place="end" n="1386" id="xix.x-p31.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.x-p32"> He seems to mean “by experience,” <i>

unconquerableness of the righteous, and the vulnerable condition of
sinners. Hear then how the prophet intimates both these

earth.”<note place="end" n="1387" id="xix.x-p32.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.x-p33"> <scripRef passage="Ps. i. 5" id="xix.x-p33.1" parsed="|Ps|1|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.1.5">Ps. i.

as chaff lies exposed to the gusts of wind, and is easily caught up
and swept along, so is also the sinner driven about by every
temptation; for whilst he is at war with himself, and bears the
warfare about with him, what hope of safety does he possess;
betrayed as he is at home, and carrying with him that conscience,
which is a constant enemy? Such, however, is not the nature of the
righteous man. But what manner of man is he? Hear the same prophet,
saying, “They that trust in the Lord are as Mount Zion.”<note place="end" n="1388" id="xix.x-p33.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.x-p34"> <scripRef passage="Ps. cxxiv. 1" id="xix.x-p34.1" parsed="|Ps|24|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.24.1">Ps.

then, “As Mount Zion?” “He shall not be shaken,” saith he,
“for ever.” For whatever engines thou bringest up, whatever
darts thou hurlest, desiring to overturn a mountain, thou wilt
never be able to prevail; for how canst thou? thou wilt break in
pieces all thine engines, and exhaust thine own strength. Such also
is the righteous man. Whatever blows he may receive, he suffereth
no evil therefrom; but destroyeth the power of those who take
counsel against him, and not of men only, but of demons. Thou hast
heard often what engines the Devil brought up against Job; but not
only did he fail to overthrow that mountain, but drew back
exhausted, his darts broken to pieces, and his engines rendered
useless, by that assault!</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.x-p35">5. Knowing these things, let us take heed to our
life; and let us not be earnest as to the goods that perish;
neither as to the glory that goeth out; nor as to that body which
groweth old; nor as to that beauty which is fading; nor as to that
pleasure which is fleeting; but let us expend all our care about
the soul; and let us provide for the welfare of this in every way.
For to cure the body, when diseased, is not an easy matter to every
one; but to cure a sick soul is easy to all; and the sickness of
the body requires medicines, as well as money, for its healing; but
the healing of the soul is a thing that is easy to procure, and
devoid of expense. And the nature of the flesh is with much labour
delivered from those wounds which are troublesome; for very often
the knife must be applied, and medicines that are bitter; but with
respect to the soul there is nothing of this kind. It suffices only
to exercise the will, and the desire, and all things are
accomplished. And this hath been the work of God’s providence.
For inasmuch as from bodily sickness no great injury could arise,
(for though we were not diseased, yet death would in any case come,
and destroy and dissolve the body); but everything depends upon the
health of our souls; this being by far the more precious and
necessary, He hath made the medicining of it easy, and void of
expense or pain. What excuse therefore, or what pardon shall we
obtain, if when the body is sick, and money must be expended on its
behalf, and physicians called in, and much anguish endured, we make
this so much a matter of our care (though what might result from
that sickness could be no great 
<pb n="398" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_398.html" id="xix.x-Page_398" />injury to us), and yet treat the soul with
neglect? And this, when we are neither called upon to pay down
money; nor to give others any trouble; nor to sustain any
sufferings; but without any of all these things, by only choosing
and willing, have it in our power to accomplish the entire
amendment of it; and knowing assuredly that if we fail to do this,
we shall sustain the extreme sentence, and punishments, and
penalties, which are inexorable! For tell me, if any one promised
to teach thee the healing art in a short space of time, without
money or labour, wouldest thou not think him a benefactor? Wouldest
thou not submit both to do and to suffer all things, whatsoever he
who promised these things commanded? Behold, now, it is permitted
thee without labour to find a medicine for wounds, not of the body,
but of the soul, and to restore it to a state of health, without
any suffering! Let us not be indifferent to the matter! For pray
what is the pain of laying aside anger against one who hath
aggrieved thee? It is a pain, indeed, to remember injuries, and not
to be reconciled! What labour is it to pray, and to ask for a
thousand good things from God, who is ready to give? What labour is
it, not to speak evil of any one? What difficulty is there in being
delivered from envy and ill-will? What trouble is it to love
one’s neighbour? What suffering is it not to utter shameful
words, nor to revile, nor to insult another? What fatigue is it not
to swear? for again I return to this same admonition. The labour of
swearing is indeed exceedingly great. Oftentimes, whilst under the
influence of anger or wrath, we have sworn, perhaps, that we would
never be reconciled to those who have injured us. Yet afterwards,
when our wrath was quenched, and our anger allayed, desiring to be
reconciled, and restrained by the obligation of these oaths, we
have suffered the same anguish, as if we were in a snare, and held
fast by indissoluble bonds. Of which fact the Devil being aware,
and understanding clearly that anger is a fire; that it is easily
extinguished, and that when it is extinguished, then reconciliation
and love follows; wishing this fire to remain unquenched, he often
binds us by an oath; so that although the anger should cease, the
obligation of the oath remaining may keep up the fire within us;
and that one of these two things may take place, either that being
reconciled we are forsworn, or that not being reconciled we subject
ourselves to the penalties of cherishing malice.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.x-p36">6. Knowing these things then, let us avoid
oaths; and let our mouth continually practise the saying,
“Believe me;”<note place="end" n="1389" id="xix.x-p36.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.x-p37"> <i>i.e</i>., instead of any stronger
asseverations.</p></note> and this will be to us a
foundation for all pious behaviour;<note place="end" n="1390" id="xix.x-p37.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.x-p38"> εὐλαβείας.</p></note> for the tongue, when it has been
disciplined to use this one expression, is ashamed, and would blush
to utter words that are disgraceful and ugly; and should it at any
time be drawn away by habit, it will be checked again, by having
many accusers. For when any one observes him who is not a swearer
giving utterance to foul words, he will take his advantage over
him, and ridicule, and exclaim tauntingly, “Thou who sayest in
all affairs, ‘Believe me,’ and venturest not to utter an oath,
dost thou disgrace thy tongue with these shameful expressions?”
So that being forcibly urged by those who are with us, even if
unwilling, we shall return again to a pious behaviour. “But
what,” says one, “if it be necessary to take an oath?” Where
there is a transgression of the law, there is no such thing as
necessity. “Is it possible then,” it is replied, “not to
swear at all?” What sayest thou? Hath God commanded, and darest
thou to ask if it be possible for His law to be kept? Why, truly it
is a thing impossible that His law should not be kept; and I am
desirous to persuade you from present circumstances of this; that
so far from its being impossible not to swear, it is impossible to
swear.<note place="end" n="1391" id="xix.x-p38.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.x-p39"> That is, assuming men to act as reasonably in
their relations to God, as they do in their relations to man.</p></note> For

sedition, and before alluded to, Hom. III. 18.</p></note> such as it might have seemed
beyond the power of many to do; yet the greater part of the sum has
been collected; and you may hear the tax gatherers saying, “Why
delay, man? Why put us off from day to day? It is not possible to
avoid it. It is the law of the Emperor, which admits of no
delay.” What sayest thou, I ask? The Emperor hath commanded thee
to bring in thy money, and it is impossible not to bring it in! God
hath commanded thee to avoid oaths! and how sayest thou, it is
impossible to avoid them!</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.x-p41">7. I am now for the sixth day admonishing you

meaning to abstain from the subject, that ye may be on your guard.
There will no longer be any excuse or allowance for you; for of
right, indeed, if nothing had been said on this matter, it ought to
have been amended of yourselves, for it is not a thing of an
intricate <pb n="399" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_399.html" id="xix.x-Page_399" />nature, or
that requires great preparation. But since ye have enjoyed the
advantage of so much admonition and counsel, what excuse will ye
have to offer, when ye stand accused before that dread tribunal,
and are required to give account of this transgression. It is
impossible to invent any excuse; but of necessity you must either
go hence amended, or, if you have not amended, be punished, and
abide the extremest penalty! Thinking, therefore, upon all these
things, and departing hence with much anxiety about them, exhort ye
one another, that the things spoken of during so many days may be
kept with all watchfulness in your minds, so that whilst we are
silent, ye instructing, edifying, exhorting one another, may
exhibit great improvement; and having fulfilled all the other
precepts, may enjoy eternal crowns; which God grant we may all
obtain, through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus
Christ, by whom and with whom be glory, to the Father, together
with the Holy Ghost, for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

after the last; it is difficult to find any especial reason for the
circumstance here referred to; there was the same impediment when
the following Homily was delivered. Perhaps the most probable
account is, that some persons began the fast with a strictness from
which they afterwards fell off. The meal spoken of was an early
dinner. Eumæus takes his ˆριστον at daybreak, Od. xvi. 2. But Athenæus,
l. i. c. 9 and 10, says that in his day such a meal was called
‡κρ€τισμα,
and the δεῖπνον of the ancients, at
mid-day, ˆριστον(quoted by Perizonius on <i>
Ælian</i>. V. H. ix. 19).</p></note> who were
here when I made the 
<pb n="400" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_400.html" id="xix.xi-Page_400" />promise. What, I would ask, can be the
cause of this? What hath repelled them from our table? He that hath
partaken of a bodily meal, it would seem, has thought it an
indignity after receiving material food, to come to the hearing of
the divine oracles. But not rightly do they think thus. For if this
were improper, Christ would not have gone through His large and
long discourses after that mystic supper; and if this had been
unsuitable, He would not, when He had fed the multitude in the
desert, have communicated His discourses to them after that meal.
For (if one must say something startling on this point), the
hearing of the divine oracles at that time is especially
profitable. For when thou hast made up thy mind that after eating
and drinking thou must repair also to the assembly, thou wilt
assuredly be careful, though perchance with reluctance, of the duty
of sobriety; and wilt neither be led away at any time into excess
of wine, or gluttony. For the thought, and the expectation of
entering the church, schools thee to partake of food and drink with
becoming decency; lest, after thou hast entered there, and joined
thy brethren, thou shouldest appear ridiculous to all present, by
smelling of wine, and unmannerly eructation.<note place="end" n="1400" id="xix.xi-p10.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xi-p11"> πολλ€κις. But Sav. and
M. πολλῆς, making the sense, “thou wilt

you who are now present, but to the absent; that they may learn
them through your means. For it is not having eaten that hinders
one’s hearing, but listlessness. But thou whilst deeming it to be
a condemnation not to fast, then addest another fault, which is far
greater and heavier, in not being a partaker of this sacred food;<note place="end" n="1401" id="xix.xi-p11.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xi-p12"> <i>i.e</i>., the oracles of Scripture explained at
church. (See Hom. II. 12.) The Holy Communion was always received
fasting.</p></note> and having
nourished the body, thou consumest the soul with famine. Yet what
kind of apology hast thou for doing this? For in the matter of
fasting thou hast, perhaps, bodily weakness to plead, but what hast
thou to say with respect to hearing? For surely weakness of body is
no impediment to thy partaking of the divine oracles! If I had
said, “Let no one who has breakfasted<note place="end" n="1402" id="xix.xi-p12.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xi-p13"> ἠριστηκὼς.</p></note> mix with us;” “let no one who
has eaten be a hearer,” thou wouldest have had some kind of
excuse; but now, when we would fain drag, entice, and beseech you
to come, what apology can ye have for turning away from us? The
unfit hearer is not he that hath eaten and drunk; but he who gives
no heed to what is said, who yawns, and is slack in attention,
having his body here, but his mind wandering elsewhere, and such a
one, though he may be fasting, is an unprofitable hearer. On the
other hand, the man who is in earnest, who is watchful and keeps
his mind in a state of attention, though he may have eaten and
drunk, will be our most suitable hearer of all. For this rule,
indeed, very properly prevails with relation to the secular
tribunals and councils. Inasmuch as they know not how to be
spiritually wise, therefore they eat not to nourishment, but to
bursting; and they drink often to excess. For this reason, as they
render themselves unfit for the management of their affairs, they
shut up the court-houses and council-chambers in the evening and at
midday.<note place="end" n="1403" id="xix.xi-p13.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xi-p14"> A canon of Isaac Lingonensis (in the eighth

there is nothing of this sort,—God forbid! But he who has eaten

body when it has become weakened.</p>

now to deal with our subject; although our mind holds back and

not come. And just as an affectionate mother when she is about to
spread out her table, grieves and laments when all her children are
not there, thus also do I now suffer; and when I think of the
absence of our brethren, I am reluctant to discharge my debt. But
ye have it in your power to rid me of this tardiness. For if ye
promise me that ye will convey to them an exact report of all I
say, we shall readily pay you down the whole;<note place="end" n="1404" id="xix.xi-p15.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xi-p16"> <i>i.e</i>, the promise of explaining that subject
which had been proposed in the two foregoing Homilies; namely, the
reason why the gift of Holy Scripture was so long delayed.</p></note> for thus the instructions,
charitably afforded on your part, will make up to them for their
absence; and ye will hear me the more attentively, knowing that you
must necessarily give an account of these things to others. In
order then that our subject may be made the clearer, let us take it
up and repeat it from the beginning. We were enquiring, then, the
other day, “On what account the Scriptures were delivered after
so many years. For this Book was delivered neither in the time of
Adam, nor of Noah, nor of Abraham, but in that of Moses. And I hear
many who say, that if the Book was profitable, it ought to
<pb n="401" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_401.html" id="xix.xi-Page_401" />have been delivered from
the very beginning; but if it was useless, it ought not to have
been delivered afterwards. But this is an obsolete argument; for it
is not quite true that anything which is profitable ought to have
been delivered from the beginning, nor if anything was delivered
from the beginning, is it quite necessary that the same should
continue afterwards.<note place="end" n="1405" id="xix.xi-p16.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xi-p17"> See Butler’s <i>Analogy</i>, p. ii. c. 6,
where the somewhat similar objection, “that Christianity is not
universal,” is discussed.</p></note> For example; Milk is useful, yet
it is not always given; but it is given to us only when we are
children; and solid food is useful; but no one ever gives it us in
the beginning of our life, but when we have passed out of the age
of childhood. Again, the summer season is useful; but it does not
show itself constantly; and the winter season is advantageous; yet
this too makes room for others. What then? Do they say that the
Scriptures are not useful? I reply; they are most useful and most
necessary. And if so useful, for what reason then, say they, were
they not delivered to us from the beginning? It was because God was
desirous of instructing the nature of man, not by letters, but by
things.<note place="end" n="1406" id="xix.xi-p17.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xi-p18"> An enlarged view of this principle is given
in Butler’s <i>Analogy</i>, p. ii. c. 7, applying it further to
the facts recorded in Holy Scripture. “The general design of
Scripture, which contains in it this revelation, thus considered as
historical, may be said to be, to give us an account of the world,
in this one single view, <i>as God’s world</i>.”</p></note> But what
does the expression “by things” signify? By means of the
Creation itself.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xi-p19">4. Observe then, how the Apostle, alighting
upon this same topic, and directing himself to those very Greeks
who said, that they had not from the beginning learnt the knowledge
of God from the Scriptures, frames his answer. Having said that,
“the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness
and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in
unrighteousness;”<note place="end" n="1407" id="xix.xi-p19.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xi-p20"> <scripRef passage="Rom. i. 18" id="xix.xi-p20.1" parsed="|Rom|1|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.1.18">Rom. i.

objection; and that many would still enquire, from whence the
Gentiles knew the truth of God, he goes on to add, “Because that
which may be known of God is manifest in them.” But how is it
manifest in them? How were they able to know God, and who hath
shewed? Declare this. “God,” saith he, “hath shewed it unto
them.” In what manner? By the sending of what kind of prophet?
what evangelist? what kind of teacher? if the holy Scriptures were
not yet given. “The invisible things of Him,” says he, “from
the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the
things that are made, even His eternal Power and Godhead.”<note place="end" n="1408" id="xix.xi-p20.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xi-p21"> <scripRef passage="Rom. i. 20" id="xix.xi-p21.1" parsed="|Rom|1|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.1.20">Rom. i.

he means is just this, He hath placed His Creation in the midst,

tell me, do they declare it? Voice they have none; mouth they

means of the spectacle itself. For when thou seest the beauty, the
breadth, the height, the position, the form, the stability thereof
during so long a period; hearing as it were a voice, and being
instructed by the spectacle, thou adorest Him who created a body so
fair and strange! The heavens may be silent, but the sight of them
emits a voice, that is louder than a trumpet’s sound; instructing
us not by the ear, but through the medium of the eyes; for the
latter is a sense which is more sure and more distinct than the
former.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xi-p24">5. For if God had given instruction by means of
books, and of letters, he who knew letters would have learnt what
was written; but the illiterate man would have gone away without
receiving any benefit from this source, unless some one else had
introduced him to it; and the wealthy man would have purchased the
Bible, but the poor man would not have been able to obtain it.
Again, he who knew the language that was expressed by the letters,
might have known what was therein contained; but the Scythian, and
the Barbarian, and the Indian, and the Egyptian, and all those who
were excluded from that language, would have gone away without
receiving any instruction. This however cannot be said with respect
to the heavens; but the Scythian, and Barbarian, and Indian, and
Egyptian, and every man that walks upon the earth, shall hear this
voice; for not by means of the ears, but through the sight, it
reaches our understanding. And of the things that are seen, there
is one uniform perception; and there is no difference, as is the
case with respect to languages. Upon this volume the unlearned, as
well as the wise man, shall be alike able to look; the poor man as
well as the rich man; and wherever any one may chance to come,
there looking upwards towards the heavens, he will receive a
sufficient lesson from the view of them: and the 
<pb n="402" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_402.html" id="xix.xi-Page_402" />prophet himself intimated and indicated
this fact, that the creation utters this voice so as to be
intelligible to barbarians, and to Greeks, and to all mankind
without exception, when he spoke on this wise; “There is no
speech, nor language, where there voice is not heard.”<note place="end" n="1411" id="xix.xi-p24.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xi-p25"> <scripRef passage="Ps. xix. 3" id="xix.xi-p25.1" parsed="|Ps|19|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.19.3">Ps. xix.

means is to this effect, that there is no nation or tongue which is
unable to understand this language; but that such is their
utterance, that it may be heard of all mankind. And that not merely
of the heavens, but of the day and night. But how of the day and
night? The heavens, indeed, by their beauty and magnitude, and by
all the rest, astonish the beholder, and transport him to an
admiration of the Creator; but as to the day and night, what can
these show us of the same kind? Nothing certainly of the same kind,
but other things which are not inferior to them; as for example;
the harmony, and the order which they so accurately observe. For
when thou considerest how they distribute between them the whole
year, and mutually divide the length of the whole space, even as if
it were by a beam and scales, thou wilt be astonished at Him who
hath ordered them! For just as certain sisters dividing their
father’s inheritance among themselves with much affection, and
not insulting one another in the smallest degree, even so too the
day and the night distribute the year with such an equality of
parts, with the utmost accuracy;<note place="end" n="1412" id="xix.xi-p25.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xi-p26"> The diurnal motion of the earth, or, as they
called it, of the heavens, was taken by Plato for the very type of
stability. The exactness of its rate is far greater than the
ancients had means to appreciate, as is proved by constant
observations, as well as by the oldest eclipses.</p></note> and keep to their own boundaries,
and never push one another aside. Never hath the day been long in
winter; and in like manner never hath the night been long in
summer, whilst so many generations have passed away; but during so
great an interval and length of time one hath not defrauded the
other even in the smallest degree; not of half an hour’s space,
no, nor of the twinkling of an eye!</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xi-p27">6. Therefore also the Psalmist,<note place="end" n="1413" id="xix.xi-p27.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xi-p28"> ψαλμῳδὸς: St. Chrys.
usually says “the prophet.”</p></note> struck
with astonishment at the equality of this distribution, exclaimed,
“Night unto night sheweth knowledge.” If thou knowest how to
meditate wisely on these matters, thou wilt admire the Being who
fixed these immoveable boundaries even from the beginning. Let the
avaricious hear these things; and those who are coveting the wealth
of others; and let them imitate the equality of the day and night.
Let those who are puffed up and high-minded also hear; and those
who are unwilling to concede the first places to others! The day
gives place to the night, and does not invade the territory of
others! But thou, whilst always enjoying honour, canst thou not
bear to share it with thy brethren? Consider also with me the
wisdom of the Lawgiver. In winter He hath ordered that the night
should be long; when the germs<note place="end" n="1414" id="xix.xi-p28.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xi-p29"> σπ™ρματα. He seems to
mean the young blade. These remarks are adapted to a climate in
which the harvest is over before midsummer.</p></note> are tender, and require more
coolness; and are unable to sustain the hotter rays of the sun; but
when they are somewhat grown, the day again increases with them,
and becomes then the longest, when the fruit has now attained
ripeness. And this is a beneficial arrangement not only for seeds,
but for our bodies. For since during winter, the sailor, and the
pilot, and the traveller, and the soldier, and the farmer, sit down
for the most part at home, fettered by the frost; and the season is
one of idleness; God hath appointed that the greater part of this
time should be consumed in night, in order that the length of the
day might not be superfluous, when men were unable to do anything.
Who can describe the perfect order of the seasons; and how these,
like some virgins dancing in a circle, succeed one another with the
happiest harmony; and how those who are in the middle cease not to
pass over to the opposite ones with a gradual and noiseless
transition? Therefore, neither are we overtaken by the summer
immediately after winter; nor by the winter immediately after the
summer; but mid-way the spring is interposed; that while we gently
and gradually take up one season after the other, we may have our
bodies hardened to encounter the summer heat without uneasiness.
For since sudden changes to opposite extremes are productive of the
worst injury and disease, God hath contrived that after winter we
should take up the spring, and after the spring the summer; and
after the summer the autumn; and thus transport us to winter, so
that these changes from seasons which are opposite, should come
upon us harmlessly and by degrees, through the aid of intermediate
ones. Who then is so wretched and pitiable, that beholding the
heavens; and beholding sea, and land; and beholding this exact
adjustment of the seasons, and the unfailing order of day and
night, he can think that these things happen of their own accord,
instead of adoring Him who hath arranged them all with a
corresponding wisdom!</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xi-p30">7. But I have yet somewhat more to say on this head.
For not only, indeed, does the magnitude and beauty of the
creation, but <pb n="403" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_403.html" id="xix.xi-Page_403" />also the
very manner of it, display a God who is the artificer of the
universe. For since we were not present at the beginning, whilst he
was engaged in the work of forming and creating all things; nor had
we been present, could we have known how they came into being,<note place="end" n="1415" id="xix.xi-p30.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xi-p31"> See <scripRef passage="Job xxxviii. 4" id="xix.xi-p31.1" parsed="|Job|38|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Job.38.4">Job

that disposed them being invisible; He hath made the mode of this
creation to become our best teacher, by compounding all things in a
manner which transcends the course of nature. Perhaps what I have
said, is not sufficiently clear. Therefore it is necessary that I
should again repeat it in a clearer manner. All men, then, must
admit that it is the course of nature for water to be supported on
the earth, and not the earth on the waters. For the earth being a
certain dense, hard, unyielding, and solid substance, is easily
able to support the nature of water; but the water, which is fluid,
and rare, and soft, and diffusive, and giving way to all it meets
with, must be unable to support any solid body, though it were of
the lightest kind. Often indeed when a small pebble fails upon it,
it yields, and makes way, and sends it down to the bottom. When
therefore thou beholdest not a small pebble, but the whole earth
borne upon the waters, and not submerged, admire the power of Him
who wrought these marvellous things in a supernatural manner! And
whence does this appear, that the earth is borne upon the waters?
The prophet declares this when he says, “He hath founded it upon
the seas, and prepared it upon the floods.”<note place="end" n="1416" id="xix.xi-p31.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xi-p32"> <scripRef passage="Ps. xxiv. 2" id="xix.xi-p32.1" parsed="|Ps|24|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.24.2">Ps. xxiv.

the variety of opinions that anciently prevailed respecting the
earth’s form and situation, one of the principal was, that the
heavens and earth above this ocean was the only visible universe;
and that all beneath the ocean was Hades, or the invisible world.
Hence when the sun set, he was said, <i>tingere se oceano</i>; and
when any went to Hades, they must first pass the ocean. Of this
opinion were not only the ancient poets, but some of the Christian
Fathers, particularly Lactantius, and St. Augustin, and others, who
thought their opinion was favoured by the Psalmist, in <scripRef passage="Ps. 24.2; 136.6" id="xix.xi-p33.2" parsed="|Ps|24|2|0|0;|Ps|136|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.24.2 Bible:Ps.136.6">Ps.

St. Bas. <i>in Hex</i>. i. c. 9, explains the “founding on the

various opinions as to its shape, and some who thought it to be
180,000 stadia round. See St. Greg. Naz. <i>Or</i>. xxviii. al.
xxxiv. c. 28, and Philoponus <i>de Mund. Cr.</i> iii. 6–13;
Galland, xii. p. 525.</p></note> What sayest thou? The water is not
able to support a small pebble on its surface, and yet bears up the
earth, great as it is; and mountains, and hills, and cities, and
plants, and men, and brutes; and it is not submerged! What do I
say? Is not submerged? How comes it to pass, that since the water
has been in close contact with it below, during so long a period,
it has not been dissolved, and the whole of it become mud? For the
substance of wood, when soaked in water but a little time, is
rotted and dissolved; and why do I say of wood? What can be firmer
than iron? yet often this is softened, when it remains a long time
in water; and well it may. For it derives its substance from the
earth. Therefore many run-away servants, when they make their
escape, dragging their shackles and chains along with them, go to
brooks of water, and thrust their shackled feet therein, and after
making the iron softer by this means, they easily break it by
striking it with a stone. Iron, forsooth, is softened, and wood is
rotted, and stones are worn away by the nature of water; yet so
great a mass as the earth hath remained such a length of time lying
upon the waters, without being either submerged, or dissolved, and
destroyed!<note place="end" n="1418" id="xix.xi-p33.3"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xi-p34"> This line of argument, from arrangements

For he that said, “He hath laid the foundation of it upon the

the same thing as hanging upon nothing. Where then is it suspended
and placed? Hear the same one saying, “In His hands are the

supports the body of the earth! But if thou believest not what I

and although you force and constrain it never so much, it cannot
submit to have its course directed downwards. For often, when we
are carrying a lighted torch, although we incline its head
downwards, we cannot compel the force of the flame to direct
<pb n="404" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_404.html" id="xix.xi-Page_404" />itself to the ground; but
still it turns upward, and passes from below toward that which is
above. But with respect to the sun, God hath made it quite the
contrary. For He hath turned his beams toward the earth, and made
his light to direct itself downward, all but saying to him by the
very shape (of the heavens), “Look downward.—Shine upon men,
for thou wert made for them!” The light, indeed, of a candle
cannot be made to submit to this; but this star, great and
marvellous as it is, bends downward, and looks toward the earth,
which is contrary to the nature of fire; owing to the power of Him
who hath commanded it. Wouldest thou have me speak of another thing
of the like kind? Waters embrace the back of the visible heaven<note place="end" n="1424" id="xix.xi-p40.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xi-p41"> In accordance with the notions of his age, St.
Chrysostom supposed that the firmament was something solid; and it
seems to have been entirely a notion of modern times, that the
visible heavens are formed of a subtle ether. Thus Homer terms them
χ€λκεον οὐρανὸν, and χαλκοβατῆ δώματα; and sometimes σιδήρειον οὐρανόν. The notion of St.
Chrysostom seems to have been similar. He supposes a solid
spherical arch, which he terms the visible heaven, which divided
the waters above from those below it. See 
<scripRef passage="Gen. i. 7" id="xix.xi-p41.1" parsed="|Gen|1|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.1.7">Gen. i. 7</scripRef>. A similar idea seems to
have prevailed among those who translated the Bible into English,
from the use of the word <i>firmament</i>, which was however a mere
copying of the Vulgate, and the Greek

by Drusius in his <i>Loca Difficiliora Pentateuchi</i>, and in
Sylvester’s translation of Du Bartas’s <i>Weeks and

parts; and yet they neither flow down, nor are moved out of their

down again to the earth, and point out the marvel? Seest thou not
this sea abounding with waves, and fierce winds; yet this sea,
spacious, and large, and furious as it is, is walled in with a
feeble sand! Mark also the wisdom of God, He permitted it not to be
at rest, nor tranquil, lest thou shouldest suppose its good order
to be of mere natural regulation; but remaining within its limits,
it lifts up its voice, and is in tumult, and roars aloud, and
raises its waves to a prodigious height. But when it comes to the
shores, and beholds the sand, it breaks up, and returns back again
within itself; teaching thee, by both these things, that it is not
the work of nature that it remains within its boundaries, but the
work of Him whose power restrains it! For this cause accordingly He
hath made the wall feeble; and hath not encompassed these shores
with wood, or stone, or mountains, lest thou shouldest impute the
regulation of the elements to such things. And, therefore, God
Himself, upbraiding the Jews with this very circumstance, said,
“Fear ye not Me, which have placed the sand for the bound of the
sea that it cannot pass it.”<note place="end" n="1428" id="xix.xi-p45.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xi-p46"> <scripRef passage="Jer. v. 22" id="xix.xi-p46.1" parsed="|Jer|5|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Jer.5.22">Jer. v.

this only, that He hath made a great and admirable world; and that
He hath compacted it in a way above the usual course of nature; but
that He hath also constituted it out of opposite things; such as
hot and cold, dry and moist, fire and water, earth and air, and
that these contrary elements, of which this whole universe
consists, though continually at strife one with another, are not
consumed of one another. The fire hath not overrun and burnt up all
things; the water hath not overflowed and drowned the whole earth.
With respect to our bodies, however, these effects really take
place; and upon the increase of the bile, fever is generated; and
the whole animal frame sustains an injury; and when there is a
superabundance of phlegm, many diseases are produced which destroy
the animal. But in the case of the universe, nothing of this kind
happens; but each thing remains held as it were by a kind of bridle
and band; preserving, by the will of the Creator, its own
boundaries; and their strife becomes a source of peace to the
whole. Are not these things evident even to a blind man? and are
not even the simple easily able to comprehend, that they were made,
and are upheld, by some Providence? For who is so silly and
senseless, that beholding such a mass of substances, such beauty,
such combination, the continual strife of such vast elements, their
opposition, and yet durability, would not reason with himself and
say, “If there were not some Providence to uphold the mass of
these bodies, not permitting the universe to fall to pieces, it
could not remain; it could not have been lasting. So perfect is the
order of the seasons, such the harmony of the day and night, so
many the kinds of brute animals, and plants, and seeds, and herbs,
that preserve their course, and yet, to the present day, none has
ever fallen into decay or sudden dissolution.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xi-p47">10. We might continue to speak not only of these
things, but also of many others, which are even more profound; and
might moralise even upon the Creation itself; but <pb n="405" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_405.html" id="xix.xi-Page_405" />reserving these subjects for

indeed, that the abstruseness of these speculations has seemed
strange to your ears; but if we be a little vigilant, and accustom

Meanwhile, it is necessary farther to say this to your Charity.
Even as God hath given us glory by means of this great creation, so
let us also glorify Him by a pure conversation! “The heavens
declare the glory of God,” though only seen; and we therefore
should declare God’s glory<note place="end" n="1431" id="xix.xi-p49.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xi-p50"> See on <scripRef passage="Rom. xi. 6" id="xix.xi-p50.1" parsed="|Rom|11|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.11.6">Rom. xi. 6</scripRef>, Hom. XVIII.</p></note> not only in speaking, but in

an unbeliever beholds thee, who art a believer, subdued, modest,
and orderly in manners, he will wonder and say, “Truly great is
the God of the Christians! What manner of men hath He formed? What,
and from what hath He made them? Hath He turned them from men into
angels? If any one treats them contemptuously, they revile not! If
any one beats them, they are not enraged! If any one does them an
injury, they pray for him who has put them in pain! They have no
enemy! They know nothing of cherishing malice! They are guiltless
of vain babbling! They have not learnt to utter a falsehood! They
cannot endure a false oath, or rather, they swear not at all, but
would prefer to have their tongue cut out, rather than to let an
oath proceed out of their mouth!” Such are the things which we
should give them cause to say of us; and we should exterminate our
evil habit of oaths, and pay at least as much honour to God, as we
do to our more valuable garments. For how truly absurd is it, that
when we have one garment better than the rest, we do not suffer
ourselves to be continually wearing it; and yet everywhere we
draggle about the name of God without concern, or ceremony! Let us
not, I earnestly pray and beseech you, let us not thus despise our
own salvation; but the care which we have used respecting this
precept from the beginning, let us carry on even to the end. For I
thus continually exhort you on the subject of oaths, not as though
condemning you of listlessness, but inasmuch as I have seen that ye
are for the most part reformed, I press you, and am urgent, that
the whole work should be finished off, and come to its perfection.
Even so act the spectators of public games. They excite those who
are near the prize, with the more vehemence. Let us, then, by no
means become weary; for we have nearly reached the completion of
this amendment; and the difficulty was at the beginning. But now
that the greater part of the evil habit has been cut away, and less
remains to correct, no labour is necessary, but we only need a
moderate degree of watchfulness, and diligence for some short time,
in order that we ourselves being amended, may also become
instructors to others; and that we may behold the Holy Passover
with much confidence, and that with much pleasure we may reap a
double or treble measure of the customary gladness of the festival.
For not so much does it delight us to be delivered from the toil
and fatigue of fasting, as to meet that holy season with an
illustrious and well-earned crown; a crown indeed that is never to
fade!</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xi-p52">11. But in order that the amendment may take
place the more quickly, do this which I tell thee. Inscribe upon
the wall of thy house, and upon the wall of thy heart, that
“flying sickle;”<note place="end" n="1433" id="xix.xi-p52.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xi-p53"> Flying hook, or sickle. See

follows the Hebrew as well as the Vulgate, the Targum, and the
Syriac. (See St. Jerome on the place, who adds Aquila, Theodotion,
and Symmachus.) The Septuagint, which St. Chrysostom usually
follows, instead of הלגִמ, probably
read לנמ, which signifies a reap-hook, or
sickle; in this, as in some other instances, the final letter
having been dropped through the carelessness of transcribers. See
Homily XV., conclusion.</p></note> and think that it is flying forth
on occasion of the curse, and constantly remember it. And if thou
observest another person swearing, restrain, forbid, and be careful
for him, and be careful for thine own domestics. For if we would
look to this, that we might not merely correct ourselves, but also
bring others to the same point, we shall ourselves quickly arrive
at the goal; since while we undertake to instruct others, we shall
be ashamed and blush, should we in our own case seem to leave those
things unperformed, which we enjoin upon them. There is no need to
say more; for much has been already spoken on these matters; and
these things are now said only by way of remembrance. But may God,
who is more sparing of our souls than we are, make us perfect in
this, and every good work; that so having completed the whole fruit
of righteousness, we may be found worthy of the kingdom of heaven,
through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ,
through Whom, and with Whom, to the Father, with the Holy Ghost, be
glory, for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p class="c9" id="xix.xii-p3">1. I <span class="c12" id="xix.xii-p3.1">joy,</span> and rejoice
with you all, that ye have actually put in practice that admonition
of ours, which we lately made with respect to those who were
absent, for the reason that they were not fasting. For I think that
many of those who have dined<note place="end" n="1434" id="xix.xii-p3.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xii-p4"> ἠριστηκότων. Suidas, however, places this meal
about the third hour.</p></note> are to-day present; and go to fill
up this goodly assemblage; and that this is the fact, I conjecture
from the more brilliant spectacle that I see around me, and the
greater concourse of hearers. Not in vain, it seems, did I lately<note place="end" n="1435" id="xix.xii-p4.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xii-p5"> πρώην. Montfaucon
assumes that this word is never applied to the preceding day: if
so, τὴν ἐπιοῦσαν, Hom. IX. sec.
10, cannot be the morrow, unless some accident delayed the delivery
of this Homily. It may be the next <i>Synaxis</i>.</p></note> spend so
many words on their account, appealing to your Charity, to draw
them to their Mother;<note place="end" n="1436" id="xix.xii-p5.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xii-p6"> See Hom. IV. 1.</p></note> and to persuade them that it is
lawful, even after bodily nourishment, to partake also of that
which is spiritual. And in which case, beloved, I ask, did ye act
for the better; at the time of the last assembly when after your
meal ye turned to your slumbers; or now, when after the meal ye
have presented yourselves at the hearing of the divine laws? Was it
best when ye loitered about in the forum, and took part in meetings
which were no wise profitable; or now, when ye stand with your own
brethren, and hear the prophetic oracles? It is no disgrace,
beloved, to have eaten, but after eating to remain at home, and so
to be deprived of this sacred banquet. For whilst thou remainest at
home, thou wilt be more slothful and supine; but coming here thou
wilt shake off all slumber and listlessness; and laying aside not
only listlessness,<note place="end" n="1437" id="xix.xii-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xii-p7"> There is a play on the words 
‡θυμία and 
ῥ‹θυμία which it seems impossible to preserve.</p></note> but also all sadness, thou wilt be
more at ease, and in better heart in all the events that may
happen.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xii-p8">2. What need then is there to say more? Stand only
nigh the man who fasts, and thou wilt straightway partake of his
good odour; for fasting is a spiritual perfume; and through the
eyes, the tongue, and every part, it manifests the good disposition
of the soul. I have said this, not for the purpose of condemning
those who have dined, but that I may shew the advantage of fasting.
I do not, however, call mere abstinence from meats, fasting; but
even before this, abstinence from sin; since he who, after he has
taken a meal, has come hither with suitable sobriety, is not very
far behind the man who fasts; even as he who continues fasting, if
he does not give earnest and diligent heed to what is spoken, will
derive no great benefit from his fast. He who eats, and yet takes a
part in the sacred assembly with suitable earnestness, is in much
better case than he who eats not at all, and remains absent. This
abstinence will by no means be able to benefit us as much as the
participation in spiritual instruction conveyeth to us benefit and
advantage. Where indeed, besides, wilt thou hear the things upon
which thou meditatest here? Wert thou to go to the bench of
justice? quarrels and contentions are there! or into the
council-chamber? there is anxious thought about political matters!
or to thine home? solicitude on the subject of thy private affairs
afflicts thee in every direction! or wert thou to go to the
conferences and debates of the forum? every thing there is earthly
and corruptible! For all the words that pass among those assembled
there, are concerning merchandize, or taxes, or the sumptuous
table, or the sale of lands, or other contracts, or wills, or
inheritances, or some other things of that kind. And shouldest thou
enter even into the royal halls, there again thou wouldest hear in
the same way all discoursing of wealth, or power, or of the glory
which is held in honour here, but of nothing that is spiritual. But
here on the contrary everything relates to heaven, and heavenly
things; to our soul, to our life, the purpose for which we were
born, and why we spend an allotted time upon earth, and on what
terms we migrate from hence, and into what condition we shall enter
after these things, and why our body is of clay, what also is the
nature of death, what, in short, the present life is, and what the
future. The discourses that are here made by us contain nothing at
all of an earthly kind, but are all in reference to spiritual
things. Thus, then, it is that we shall have made great provision
for our salvation, and shall depart hence with a good hope.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xii-p9">3. Since, therefore, we did not scatter the seed in
vain, but ye hunted out all who were 
<pb n="407" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_407.html" id="xix.xii-Page_407" />absent, as I exhorted you; suffer us now to
return you a recompense; and having reminded you of a few things
that were said before, to repay you again what remains. What then
were those matters that were before treated of? We were enquiring
how, and in what manner, before the giving of the Scriptures, God
ordered His dispensation toward us; and we said, that by means of
the creation He instructed our race, stretching out the heavens,
and there openly unfolding a vast volume, useful alike to the
simple and the wise, to the poor and to the rich, to Scythians and
to barbarians, and to all in general who dwell upon the earth; a
volume which is much larger than the multitude of those instructed
by it. We discoursed also at length concerning the night, and the
day, and the order of these, as well as of the harmony which is
strictly preserved by them; and much was said respecting the
measured dance of the seasons of the year, and of their equality.
For just as the day defraudeth not the night even of half an hour
throughout the whole year, so also do these distribute all the days
among themselves equally. But, as I said before, not only does the
greatness and beauty of the creation shew forth the Divine
Architect, but the very manner likewise in which it is compacted
together, and the method of operation, transcending as it does, the
ordinary course of nature. For it would have been in accordance
with nature for water to be borne upon the earth; but now we see,
on the contrary, that the earth is supported by the waters. It
would have been in accordance with nature that fire should tend
upwards; but now on the contrary we see the beams of the sun
directed towards the earth; and the waters to be above the heavens,
yet not falling away;<note place="end" n="1438" id="xix.xii-p9.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xii-p10"> οὐ διολισθαίνοντα.</p></note> and the sun running below them,
yet not quenched by the waters, nor dispelling their moisture.
Besides these things we said that this whole universe consists of
four elements, these being adverse to and at strife with one
another; yet one does not consume the other, although they are
mutually destructive. Whence it is evident that some invisible
power bridles them, and the will of God becomes their
bond.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xii-p11">4. To-day, I wish to dwell a little more on
this subject. Arouse yourselves, however, and give earnest heed
unto us! And that the wonder may appear more clearly, I will draw
the lesson concerning these things from our own bodies. This body
of ours, so short, and small, consists of four elements; viz. of
what is warm, that is, of blood; of what is dry, that is, of yellow
bile; of what is moist, that is, of phlegm; of what is cold, that
is, of black bile. And let no one think this subject foreign to
that which we have in hand. “For He that is spiritual judgeth all
things; yet He Himself is judged of no man.”<note place="end" n="1439" id="xix.xii-p11.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xii-p12"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. ii. 15" id="xix.xii-p12.1" parsed="|1Cor|2|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.2.15">1 Cor.
ii. 15</scripRef>.</p></note> Thus also Paul touched upon
principles of agriculture, whilst discoursing to us of the
Resurrection; and said, “Thou fool; that which thou sowest is not
quickened, except it die.”<note place="end" n="1440" id="xix.xii-p12.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xii-p13"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. xv. 38" id="xix.xii-p13.1" parsed="|1Cor|15|38|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.15.38">1 Cor.
xv. 38</scripRef>.</p></note> But if that blessed man brought
forward questions of agriculture, neither should any one blame us
if we handle matters pertaining to medical science. For our
discourse is now respecting the Creation of God; and this
ground-work of ideas will be necessary for our purpose. As,
therefore, I said before, this body of ours consists of four
elements; and if either revolts against the whole, death is the
result of this revolt. As for instance, by a superabundance “of
bile” fever is produced; and should this proceed beyond a certain
measure, it effects a rapid dissolution. Again, when there is an
excess of the cold element, paralyses, agues, apoplexies, and an
infinite number of other maladies are generated. And every form of
disease is the effect of an excess of these elements; when either
of them overpassing its own bounds, acts the part of a tyrant
against the rest, and mars the symmetry of the whole. Interrogate
then him who says, that all things are spontaneous and
self-produced. If this little and diminutive body, having the
advantage of medicines, and of medical skill, and of a soul within
which regulates it, and of much moral wisdom, as well as
innumerable other helps, be not always able to continue in a state
of order, but often perishes, and is destroyed, when some
disturbance takes place within it; how could a world like this,
containing substances of such vast bulk and compounded of those
same elements, remain during so long a time without any
disturbance, unless it enjoyed the advantage of a manifold
providence? Neither would it be reasonable to suppose that this
body, which has the benefit of superintendence both without and
within, should scarcely be sufficient for its own preservation; and
that a world such as this is, enjoying no such superintendence,
should during so many years suffer nothing of that sort which our
body suffers. For how, I ask, is it that not one of these elements
hath gone beyond its own boundaries, nor swallowed up all the rest?
Who hath brought them together from the beginning? Who hath bound?
Who hath bridled? Who 
<pb n="408" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_408.html" id="xix.xii-Page_408" />hath held them together during so long a period?
For if the body of the world were simple and uniform, what I speak
of would not have been so impossible. But when there hath been such
a strife between the elements, even from the beginning; who so
senseless as to think that these things would have come together,
and remained together when united, without One to effect this
conjunction? For if we who are evil-affected towards one another
not by nature, but by will, cannot come spontaneously to an
agreement as long as we remain at variance, and hold ourselves
ungraciously towards one another; if we have yet need of some one
else to bring us into a state of conjunction; and after this
conjunction further to clench us, and persuade us to abide by our
reconciliation, and not again to be at variance; how could the
elements, which neither partake of sense nor reason, and which are
naturally adverse, and inimical to each other, have come together,
and agreed and remained with one another, if there were not some
ineffable Power which effected this conjunction; and after this
conjunction, always restrained them by the same bond?</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xii-p14">5. Dost thou not perceive how this body wastes
away, withers, and perishes after the secession of the soul, and
each of the elements thereof returns to its own appointed place?<note place="end" n="1441" id="xix.xii-p14.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xii-p15"> λῆξιν. See on <scripRef passage="Rom. iii. 11" id="xix.xii-p15.1" parsed="|Rom|3|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.3.11">Rom. iii.
11</scripRef>, Hom. VII.</p></note> This very
same thing, indeed, would also happen to the world, if the Power
which always governs it had left it devoid of Its own providence.
For if a ship does not hold together without a pilot, but soon
founders, how could the world have held together so long a time if
there was no one governing its course? And that I may not enlarge,
suppose the world to be a ship; the earth to be placed below as the
keel; the sky to be the sail; men to be the passengers;<note place="end" n="1442" id="xix.xii-p15.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xii-p16"> ἐπιβ€τας. Usually soldiers on ship-board;

foundering! But the world, though subsisting now five thousand
years, and many more, hath suffered nothing of the kind. But why do
I talk of a ship? Suppose one hath pitched a small hut in the
vineyards; and when the fruit is gathered, leaves it vacant; it
stands, however, scarce two or three days, but soon goes to pieces,
and tumbles down! Could not a hut, forsooth, stand without
superintendence? How then could the workmanship of a world, so fair
and marvellous; the laws of the night and day; the interchanging
dances of the seasons; the course of nature chequered and varied as
it is in every way throughout the earth, the sea, the sky; in
plants, and in animals that fly, swim, walk, creep; and in the race
of men, far more dignified than any of these, continue yet
unbroken, during so long a period, without some kind of providence?
But in addition to what has been said, follow me whilst I enumerate
the meadows, the gardens, the various tribes of flowers; all sorts
of herbs, and their uses;<note place="end" n="1444" id="xix.xii-p17.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xii-p18"> χρ™ιας: others read

are barren; the nature of metals,—and of animals,—in the sea,
or on the land; of those that swim, and those that traverse the
air; the mountains, the forests, the groves; the meadow below, and
the meadow above; for there is a meadow on the earth, and a meadow
too in the sky; the various flowers of the stars; the rose below,
and the rainbow above! Would you have me point out also the meadow
of birds? Consider the variegated body of the peacock, surpassing
every dye, and the fowls of purple plumage.<note place="end" n="1445" id="xix.xii-p18.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xii-p19"> τοὺς πορφυρίζοντας

mentions a bird called Porphyrio, more esteemed even than the

the sky; how it has been preserved so long without being dimmed;
and remains as bright and clear as if it had been only fabricated
to-day; moreover, the power of the earth, how its womb has not
become effete by bringing forth during so long a time! Contemplate
with me the fountains; how they burst forth and fail not, since the
time they were begotten, to flow forth continually throughout the
day and night! Contemplate with me the sea, receiving so many
rivers, yet never exceeding its measure! But how long shall we
pursue things unattainable! It is fit, indeed, that over every one
of these which has been spoken of, we should say, “O Lord, how
hast Thou magnified Thy works; in wisdom hast Thou made them
all.”<note place="end" n="1446" id="xix.xii-p19.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xii-p20"> <scripRef passage="Ps. civ. 24" id="xix.xii-p20.1" parsed="|Ps|4|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.4.24">Ps. civ.

<p class="c10" id="xix.xii-p21">6. But what is the sapient argument of the
unbelievers, when we go over all these particulars with them; the
magnitude, the beauty of the creation, the prodigality, the
munificence everywhere displayed? This very thing, say they, is the
worst fault, that God hath made the world so beautiful and so vast.
For if He had not made it beautiful and vast, we should not have
made a god of it; but now being struck with its grandeur, and <pb n="409" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_409.html" id="xix.xii-Page_409" />marvelling at its beauty, we
have thought it to be a deity.<note place="end" n="1447" id="xix.xii-p21.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xii-p22"> See the argument of Balbus (the Stoic), Cic.
<i>de Nat. Deor</i>. l. 2, c. 17, 34, &amp;c. Seneca, <i>Nat.

Mundus</i>, or <i>Fatum</i>, or <i>Providentia</i>, or <i>
Natura</i>.</p></note> But such an argument is good for
nothing. For that neither the magnitude, nor beauty of the world is
the cause of this impiety, but their own want of understanding, is
what we are prepared to show, proved by the case of ourselves, who
have never been so affected. Why then have “we” not made a
deity of it? Do we not see it with the same eyes as themselves? Do
we not enjoy the same advantage from the creation with themselves?
Do we not possess the same soul? Have we not the same body? Do we
not tread the same earth? How comes it that this beauty and
magnitude hath not persuaded us to think the same as they do? But
this will be evident not from this proof only, but from another
besides. For as a proof that it is not for its beauty they have
made a deity of it, but by reason of their own folly, why do they
adore the ape, the crocodile, the dog, and the vilest of animals?
Truly, “they became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish
heart was darkened. Professing themselves to be wise, they became
fools.”<note place="end" n="1448" id="xix.xii-p22.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xii-p23"> <scripRef passage="Rom. i. 21, 22" id="xix.xii-p23.1" parsed="|Rom|1|21|1|22" osisRef="Bible:Rom.1.21-Rom.1.22">Rom. i.

<p class="c10" id="xix.xii-p24">7. Nevertheless, we will not frame our answer
from these things only, but will also say something yet further.
For God, foreseeing these things of old, destroyed, in His wisdom,
this plea of theirs. On this account He made the world not only
wonderful and vast, but also corruptible and perishable; and placed
therein many evidences of its weakness; and what He did with
respect to the Apostles,<note place="end" n="1449" id="xix.xii-p24.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xii-p25"> See Hom. I. 15.</p></note> He did with respect to the whole
world. What then did He with respect to the Apostles? Since they
used to perform many great and astonishing signs and wonders, He
suffered them constantly to be scourged, to be expelled, to inhabit
the dungeon, to encounter bodily infirmities, to be in continual
tribulations, lest the greatness of their miracles should make them
to be accounted as gods amongst mankind. Therefore when He had
bestowed so great favour upon them, He suffered their bodies to be
mortal, and in many cases obnoxious to disease; and did not remove
their infirmity, that He might give full proof of their nature. And
this is not merely my assertion, but that of Paul himself, who

vessels?” In this body, he means, which is mortal and perishable.
For just as the earthen vessel is formed from clay and fire, so
also the body of these saints being clay, and receiving the energy
of the spiritual fire, becomes an earthen vessel. But for what
reason was it thus constituted, and so great a treasure, and such a
plentitude of graces entrusted to a mortal and corruptible body?
“That the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of
us.” For when thou seest the Apostles raising the dead, yet
themselves sick, and unable to remove their own infirmities, thou
mayest clearly perceive, that the resurrection of the dead man was
not effected by the power of him who raised him, but by the energy
of the Spirit. For in proof, that they were frequently sick, hear
what Paul saith respecting Timothy, “Use a little wine for thy
stomach’s sake, and thine often infirmities.”<note place="end" n="1452" id="xix.xii-p27.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xii-p28"> <scripRef passage="1 Tim. v. 23" id="xix.xii-p28.1" parsed="|1Tim|5|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.5.23">1 Tim. v.

to what extent of impiety might not men have proceeded, when they
beheld their miracles? As then in this case, because of the
greatness of these signs, He suffered their nature to remain in a
state of infirmity, and permitted those repeated trials, in order
that they might not be thought to be gods, thus likewise He did
with respect to the creation, a thing nearly parallel to this. For
He fashioned it beautiful and vast; but on the other hand
corruptible.</p>

sends forth his rays under the East; and adorning the heaven as it
were with a saffron-coloured veil, and making the clouds like
roses, and running unimpeded all the day; he meets no obstacle to
interrupt his course. Beholdest thou, then, his beauty? Beholdest
thou his greatness? Look also at the proof of his weakness! For a
certain wise man, to make this plain, said, “What is brighter
than the sun, yet the light thereof suffers eclipse.”<note place="end" n="1463" id="xix.xii-p39.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xii-p40"> <scripRef passage="Ecclesiasticus 17.31" id="xix.xii-p40.1" parsed="|Sir|17|31|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Sir.17.31">Ecclus. xvii. 31</scripRef>.</p></note> Nor is it
only from this circumstance that his infirmity is to be perceived,
but also in the concourse of the clouds. Often, at least, when a
cloud passes underneath him, though emitting his beams, and
endeavouring to pierce through it, he has not strength to do so;
the cloud being too dense, and not suffering him to penetrate
through it. “He nourishes the seeds, however,”<note place="end" n="1464" id="xix.xii-p40.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xii-p41"> See Plin. ii. 6.</p></note> replies
some one—Yes—still he does not nourish them by himself, but
requires the assistance of the earth, and of the dew, and of the
rains, and of the winds, and the right distribution of the seasons.
And unless all these things concur, the sun’s aid is but
superfluous. But this would not seem to be like a deity, to stand
in need of the assistance of others, for that which he wishes to
do; for it is a special attribute of God to want nothing; He
Himself at least did not in this manner bring forth the seeds from
the ground; He only commanded, and they all shot forth. And again,
that thou mayest learn that it is not the nature of the elements,
but His command which effects all things; He both brought into
being these very elements which before were not; and without the
need of any aid, He brought down the manna for the Jews. For it is
said, “He gave them bread from heaven.”<note place="end" n="1465" id="xix.xii-p41.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xii-p42"> <scripRef passage="Ps. lxxviii. 24" id="xix.xii-p42.1" parsed="|Ps|78|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.78.24">Ps.

the perfection of fruits, the sun requires the aid of other
elements for their sustenance; when he himself requires the
assistance of many things for his sustenance, and would not himself
be sufficient for himself. For in order that he may proceed on his
way, he needs the heaven as a kind of pavement spread out
underneath him; and that he may shine, he needs the clearness and
rarity of the air; since if even this become unusually dense, he is
not able to show his light; and, on the other hand, he requires
coolness and moisture, lest his rays should be intolerable to all,
and burn up everything. When, therefore, other elements overrule
him, and correct his weakness (overrule as for example, clouds, and
walls, and certain other bodies that intercept his light:—or
correct his excess, as the dews, and fountains, and cool air), how
can such a one be a Deity? For God must be independent, and not
stand in need of assistance, be the source of all good things to
all, and be hindered by nothing; even as Paul, as well as the
prophet Isaiah, saith of God; the latter<note place="end" n="1466" id="xix.xii-p42.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xii-p43"> St. Chrysostom here seems to have quoted from

independence of help, and shewing that both these things especially
belong to God; to stand in need of nothing, and of Himself to
supply all things to all; speaks on this wise, “God that made the

giving to all life and all things.”<note place="end" n="1470" id="xix.xii-p46.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xii-p47"> <scripRef passage="Acts xvii. 25" id="xix.xii-p47.1" parsed="|Acts|17|25|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.17.25">Acts

Chrysostom quotes from memory, as the first clause shows.</p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xii-p48">9. It would indeed be easy for us to take a survey
of the other elements, the heaven, the air, the earth, the sea, and
to shew the imbecility of these, and how each requires the
assistance of his neighbour, and without this assistance, is lost
and destroyed. For as it regards the earth, if the fountains fail
it, and the moisture infused from the sea and the rivers, it
quickly perishes by being parched. The remaining elements too stand
in need of one another, the air of the sun, as well as the sun of
the air. But not to protract this discourse; in what has been said,
having given a sufficient supply of reasons to start from for those
who are willing to receive them, we shall be content. For if the
sun, which is the most surprising part of the whole creation, hath
been proved to be so feeble and needy, how much more the other
parts of the universe? What then I have advanced (offering these
things for the consideration of the studious), I will myself again
shew you in discourse from the Scriptures; and prove, <pb n="411" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_411.html" id="xix.xii-Page_411" />that not only the sun, but also the
whole universe is thus corruptible. For since the elements are
mutually destructive, and when much cold intervenes, it chastens
the force of the sun’s rays; and on the other hand, the heat
prevailing, consumes the cold; and since the elements are both the
causes and subjects of contrary qualities, and dispositions, in one
another; it is very evident that these things offer a proof of
great corruptibility; and of the fact, that all these things which
are visible, are a corporeal substance.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xii-p49">10. But since this subject is too lofty for
our simplicity, permit me now to lead you to the sweet fountain of
the Scriptures, that we may refresh your ears. For we will not
discourse to you of the heaven and the earth separately, but will
exhibit the Apostle declaring this very thing to us concerning the
whole creation, in these plain terms, that the whole creation is
now in bondage to corruption; and why it is thus in bondage, and at
what time it shall be delivered from it, and unto what condition it
shall be translated. For after he had said, “The sufferings of
this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that
shall be revealed in us;” he goes on to add; “For the earnest
expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the
sons of God. For the creature was made subject to vanity, not
willingly, but by reason of Him who hath subjected the same in
hope.”<note place="end" n="1471" id="xix.xii-p49.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xii-p50"> <scripRef passage="Rom. viii. 21" id="xix.xii-p50.1" parsed="|Rom|8|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.8.21">Rom.
viii. 21</scripRef>.</p></note> But what
he intends is to this effect; “The creature,” he says, “was
made corruptible;” for this is implied in the expression,
“being made subject to vanity.” For it was made corruptible by
the command of God. But God so commanded it for the sake of our
race; for since it was to nurture a corruptible man, it was
necessary itself should also be of the same character; for of
course corruptible bodies were not to dwell in an incorruptible
creation. But, nevertheless, he tells us, it will not remain so.
“The creature<note place="end" n="1472" id="xix.xii-p50.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xii-p51"> κτίσις, rendered
here <i>creature</i>, would be in modern English, <i>creation</i>.
“Creature” is used by Wiclif even for the act of
creating, <scripRef passage="Rom. i. 20" id="xix.xii-p51.1" parsed="|Rom|1|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.1.20">Rom. i.
20</scripRef>. “Creation”
properly means the act, “creature” an instance or effect of it,
general or particular, but of late the latter only.</p></note> also
itself shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption;” and
afterwards, for the purpose of shewing when this event shall take
place, and through whom, he adds, “Into the glorious liberty of
the sons of God.” For when we are raised, his meaning is, and
assume incorruptible bodies; then also this body of the heaven, the
earth, and the whole creation, shall be incorruptible, and
imperishable. When, therefore, thou beholdest the sun arising,
admire the Creator; when thou beholdest him hiding himself and
disappearing, learn the weakness of his nature, that thou mayest
not adore him as a Deity! For God hath not only implanted in the
nature of the elements this proof of their weakness, but hath also
bidden His servants, that were but men, command them; so that
although thou shouldest not know their servitude from their aspect,
thou mayest learn, from those who have commanded them, that they
are all thy fellow-servants. Therefore it was, that Joshua, the son
of Nave,<note place="end" n="1473" id="xix.xii-p51.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xii-p52"> Instead of Joshua, the son of <i>Nun</i>,
the Greek Fathers, following the Septuagint, read <i>of Nave</i>; a
mistake which originated evidently from the final n or ן of the Hebrew, so closely corresponding with
the ו or v.</p></note> said,
“Let the sun stand still in Gibeon, and the moon over against the
valley of Ajalon.” And again the prophet Isaiah made the sun to
retrace his steps, under the reign of Hezekiah; and Moses gave
orders to the air, and the sea, the earth, and the rocks. Elisha
changed the nature of the waters; the Three Children triumphed over
the fire. Thou seest how God hath provided for us on either hand;
leading us by the beauty of the elements to the knowledge of His
divinity; and, by their feebleness, not permitting us to lapse into
the worship of them.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xii-p53">11. For the sake of all these things then, let
us glorify Him, our Guardian; not only by words, but also by deeds;
and let us shew forth an excellent conversation, not only in
general, but in particular with regard to abstinence from oaths.
For not every sin brings the same penalty; but those which are
easiest to be amended, bring upon us the greatest punishment: which
indeed Solomon intimated, when he said, “It is not wonderful if
any one be taken stealing; for he stealeth that he may satisfy his
soul that is hungry; but the adulterer, by the lack of
understanding, destroyeth his own soul.”<note place="end" n="1474" id="xix.xii-p53.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xii-p54"> <scripRef passage="Prov. vi. 30, 32" id="xix.xii-p54.1" parsed="|Prov|6|30|0|0;|Prov|6|32|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Prov.6.30 Bible:Prov.6.32">Prov. vi.
30, 32</scripRef>, LXX.</p></note> But what he means is to this
effect. The thief is a grievous offender, but not so grievous a one
as the adulterer: for the former, though it be a sorry reason for
his conduct, yet at the same time has to plead the necessity
arising from indigence; but the latter, when no necessity compels
him, by his mere madness rushes into the gulph of iniquity. This
also may be said with regard to those who swear. For they have not
any pretext to allege, but merely their contempt.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xii-p55">12. I know, indeed, that I may seem to be too
tedious and burdensome; and that I may be thought to give annoyance
by continuing this admonition. But nevertheless, I do not desist,
in order that ye may even be shamed by my shamelessness to abstain
from the cus<pb n="412" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_412.html" id="xix.xii-Page_412" />tom of oaths. For
if that unmerciful and cruel judge, paying respect to the
importunity of the widow, changed his custom, much more will ye do
this; and especially when he who is exhorting you, doth it not for
himself, but for your salvation. Or rather, indeed, I cannot deny
that I do this for myself; for I consider your benefit as my own
success. But I could wish that you, even as I labour, and weary
myself for your safety, would in like manner make your own souls a
matter of anxiety to yourselves; and then assuredly this work of
reformation would be perfected. And what need is there to multiply
words? For if there were no hell, neither punishment for the
contumacious, nor reward for the obedient; and I had come to you,
and asked this in the way of a favour, would ye not have consented?
would ye not have granted my petition, when I asked so trifling a
favour? But when it is God who asks this favour, and for the sake
of yourselves, who are to grant it, and not for Himself, Who is to
receive it; who is there so ungracious, who is there so miserable
and wretched, that he will not grant this favour to God, when He
asks it; and especially when he himself who grants it, is in future
to enjoy the benefit of it? Considering these things then, repeat
over to yourselves, when ye depart hence, all that has been said;
and correct in every way those who take no heed to it; to the end
that we may receive the recompense of other men’s good actions,
as well as our own, through the grace and lovingkindness of our
Lord Jesus Christ, by Whom, and with Whom be glory to the Father,
with the Holy Ghost, for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

condition, indeed, on former days was nothing better than that of
those who are tossed up and down in the midst of the deep; and
expecting shipwreck every hour. We were scared all day long by
innumerable rumours, and disturbed and agitated on every side; and
were every day busy and curious to know who had come from the

<p class="c10" id="xix.xiii-p6">2. For this cause yourselves too kept silence

the soul when once it is filled with despondency, is not apt to

sitting <pb n="413" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_413.html" id="xix.xiii-Page_413" />down upon
the dunghill, and covered with sores, they rent their garments, and
groaned and sat down by him in silence; making it manifest that
nothing is so suitable to the afflicted at first, as quiet and
silence. For the calamity was too great for consolation. Therefore
also the Jews, whilst they were in bondage to work in clay and the
brick-making, when they saw Moses come to them, were not able to
give heed to his words, by reason of their failure of spirit, and
their affliction. And what marvel is it that faint-hearted men have
felt this, when we find that the Disciples also fell into the same
infirmity. For after that mystic Supper, when Christ took<note place="end" n="1478" id="xix.xiii-p7.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xiii-p8"> Or, “had” (λαβῶν,

evils they should in a little while afterwards encounter, the wars,
and the persecutions, and the universal enmity, the stripes, the
prisons, the tribunals, the appearance before magistrates; then,
their souls oppressed as by a heavy burthen with the dread of the
things He had spoken, and with the sadness of these approaching
events, remained henceforth in a state of stupor. Christ,
therefore, perceiving their consternation, reproved it by saying,
“I go to My Father, and no one among you asketh Me, Whither goest
Thou? But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath
filled your hearts.” For this reason also we were silent for some
time past, awaiting the present opportunity. For if a person who is
about to ask a favour of any one, though the request be a
reasonable one, waits a fitting occasion to propose it, that he may
find him who is to grant the petition in a mild and well-disposed
frame of mind; and that receiving assistance from the favourable
opportunity, he may obtain the benefit; how much rather is it
necessary that the speaker should seek a fit season, so that he may
address his discourse to an auditor well affected, and free from
all care and despondency; which accordingly we have
done.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xiii-p9">3. Inasmuch, then, as ye have now shaken off
despondency, we are desirous to recall you to the recollection of
former matters; so that our discourse may be rendered the clearer
to you. For what we said of the creation, that God not only made it
beautiful, and wonderful, and vast, but also weak and corruptible;
and moreover that He hath established divers proofs of this;
ordering both these circumstances for our advantage; leading us on
by its beauty to admiration of Him who framed it: and by its
weakness leading us away from the worship of the creature; this we
may see, take place also in the case of the body. For with respect
to this too there are many among the enemies to the truth, as well
as among those who belong to our own ranks, who make it a subject
of enquiry, why it was created corruptible and frail? Many also of
the Greeks and heretics affirm, that it was not even created by
God.<note place="end" n="1479" id="xix.xiii-p9.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xiii-p10"> Plato, in his <i>Timæus</i>, 40, d. 42e.,
makes the human <i>body</i> the work of (good) demons, or created
gods, because it would have been of a more perfect nature if the
Supreme God had made it. Of heretics who held such opinions as are
here mentioned, see 
<scripRef passage="Rom. viii. 5-7" id="xix.xiii-p10.1" parsed="|Rom|8|5|8|7" osisRef="Bible:Rom.8.5-Rom.8.7">Rom. viii. 5–7</scripRef>, Hom. XIII. Valentinus,
Marcion, Basilides, and other early heretics of the Gnostic school,
held matter to be evil, and the world made by evil beings.</p></note> For they
declare it to be unworthy of God’s creative art, and enlarge upon
its impurities, its sweat, its tears, its labours, and sufferings,
and all the other incidents of the body. But, for my part, when
such things are talked of, I would first make this reply. Tell me
not of man, fallen, degraded and condemned. But if thou wouldest
learn what manner of body God formed us with at the first, let us
go to Paradise, and survey the Man that was created at the
beginning. For that body was not thus corruptible and mortal; but
like as some statue of gold just brought from the furnace, that
shines splendidly, so that frame was free from all corruption.
Labour did not trouble it, nor sweat deface it. Cares did not
conspire against it; nor sorrows besiege it; nor was there any
other affection of that kind to distress it. But when man did not
bear his felicity with moderation, but threw contempt upon his
Benefactor, and thought a deceiving demon more worthy of credit
than God who cared for him, and who had raised him to honour, and
when he expected to become himself a god, and conceived thoughts
above his proper dignity, then,—then indeed it was that God, to
humble him by decisive acts, made him mortal, as well as
corruptible; and fettered him with such varied necessities; not
from hatred or aversion, but in care for him, and to repress at the
very outset that evil and destructive pride; and instead of
permitting it to proceed any further, He admonished Him by actual
experience, that he was mortal and corruptible; thus to convince
him that he must never again think or dream of such things as he
had done. For the devil’s suggestion, was, “Ye shall be as
gods.”<note place="end" n="1480" id="xix.xiii-p10.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xiii-p11"> <scripRef passage="Gen. iii. 5" id="xix.xiii-p11.1" parsed="|Gen|3|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.3.5">Gen. iii.
5</scripRef>.</p></note> Desiring
then utterly to eradicate this idea, God made the body subject to
much suffering and disease; to instruct him by its very nature that
he must never again entertain such a thought. And that <pb n="414" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_414.html" id="xix.xiii-Page_414" />this is true, is really most
evident from what befel him; for after such an expectation, he was
condemned to this punishment. Consider also with me the wisdom<note place="end" n="1481" id="xix.xiii-p11.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xiii-p12"> σύνεσιν.</p></note> of God in
this matter. He did not allow him to be the first to die, but
permitted his son to suffer this death; in order that seeing before
his eyes the body corrupting and decaying, he might receive a
striking lesson of wisdom<note place="end" n="1482" id="xix.xiii-p12.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xiii-p13"> φιλοσοφία.</p></note> from that spectacle; and learn
what had come to pass, and be duly chastened before he departed
hence.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xiii-p14">4. Really then, as I said, this point is
apparent from what has already taken place; but it will be made no
less clear from what yet remains to be stated. For if whilst we are
fettered with such necessities of the body; and whilst it is the
lot of all men to die, to suffer corruption, to moulder in the
sight of all, and to dissolve into dust, so that the Gentile
philosophers made one and the same comprehensive definition of the
human race (for when asked what man was, they answered, he is an
animal, rational and mortal); if, forsooth, whilst all admitted
this, there were some who dared in the opinion of the multitude to
immortalize themselves; and notwithstanding that the very sense of
sight bore witness to their mortality, were ambitious to be called
gods, and were honoured as such; to what a length of impiety would
not many men have proceeded, if death had not gone on teaching all
men the mortality and corruptibility of our nature? Hear, for
instance, what the prophet says of a barbarian king, when seized
with this frenzy. “I will exalt,” saith he, “my throne above
the stars of heaven; and I will be like unto the Most High.”<note place="end" n="1483" id="xix.xiii-p14.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xiii-p15"> <scripRef passage="Isa. xiv. 13, 14" id="xix.xiii-p15.1" parsed="|Isa|14|13|14|14" osisRef="Bible:Isa.14.13-Isa.14.14">Isa. xiv.
13, 14</scripRef>.</p></note>
Afterwards, deriding him, and speaking of his death, he says,
“Corruption is under thee, and the worm is thy covering;”<note place="end" n="1484" id="xix.xiii-p15.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xiii-p16"> <scripRef passage="Isa. xiv. 11" id="xix.xiii-p16.1" parsed="|Isa|14|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.14.11">Isa. xiv.

meaning is, “Dost thou dare, O man, whom such an end is awaiting,
to entertain such imaginations?” Again, of another, I mean the
king of the Tyrians, when he conceived the like aims, and was
ambitious to be considered as a God, he says, “Thou art not a
God, but a man, and they that pierce thee shall say so.”<note place="end" n="1485" id="xix.xiii-p16.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xiii-p17"> <scripRef passage="Ezek. xxviii. 9" id="xix.xiii-p17.1" parsed="|Ezek|28|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ezek.28.9">Ezek.
xxviii. 9</scripRef>.</p></note> Thus God,
in making this body of ours as it is, hath from the beginning
utterly taken away all occasion of idolatry.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xiii-p18">5. But why dost thou marvel if this hath happened in
respect to the body, when even with respect to the soul it is
plain, that a similar thing hath taken place. For God made it not
mortal, but permitted it to be immortal; He constituted it however
subject to forgetfulness, to ignorance, to sadness, and to care;
and this, lest regarding its own nobility of birth, it might take
up a conceit too high for its proper dignity. For if, even while
the case stands thus, some have dared to aver, that it is of the
Divine essence; to what a pitch of frenzy would they not have
reached, if it had been devoid of these imperfections? What,
however, I affirmed respecting the creation, I affirm also
respecting the body, that both these things alike excite my
admiration of God; that He hath made it corruptible; and that in
its very corruptibility, He hath manifested His own power and
wisdom. For that He could have made it of some better material, He
hath evidenced from the celestial and the solar substance. For He
that made those such as they are, could have made this also like
them, had He thought proper to do so. But the cause of its
imperfection is what I before adverted to. This circumstance by no
means lowers the admiration due to the Creator’s workmanship, but
rather increases it; for the meanness of the substance, manifests
the resource and adaptiveness of His art; since He hath introduced
such a harmony of parts in clay and ashes, and senses so various
and manifold and capable of such spiritual wisdom.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xiii-p19">6. In proportion, therefore, as thou findest fault
with the meanness of the substance, be so much the more astonished
at the greatness of the art displayed. For this reason also, I do
not so much admire the statuary who forms a beautiful figure out of
gold, as him who, by the resources of art, is able, even in
crumbling clay, to exhibit a marvellous and inimitable mould of
beauty. In the former case, the material gives some aid to the
artist, but in the latter, there is a naked display of his art.
Wouldest thou learn then, how great the wisdom of the Creator is,
consider what it is that is made out of clay? What else is there
but brick and tile? Nevertheless, God, the Supreme Artist, from the
same material of which only the brick and tile is formed, hath been
able to make an eye so beautiful, as to astonish all who behold it,
and to implant in it such power, that it can at once survey the
high aerial expanse, and by the aid of a small pupil embrace the
mountains, forests, hills, the ocean, yea, the heaven, by so small
a thing! Tell me not then of tears and rheums, for these things are
the fruit of thy sin; but consider its beauty, and visual power;
and how it is that whilst it ranges over such an expanse of air, it
experiences no weariness or distress! The feet indeed become tired
and weakened even after going but a small distance; but the eye, in
travers<pb n="415" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_415.html" id="xix.xiii-Page_415" />ing a space so lofty and
so wide, is not sensible of any infirmity. For since this is the
most necessary to us of all our members, He has not suffered it to
be oppressed with fatigue; in order that the service it renders us
might be free and unfettered.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xiii-p20">7. But rather, I should say, what language is fully
adequate to set forth the whole excellency of this member? And why
do I speak of the pupil and the visual faculty? for if you were to
investigate that which seems the meanest of all the members, I mean
the eyelashes, you would behold even in these the manifold wisdom
of God the Creator! For as it is with respect to the ears of corn;
the beards, standing forth as a sort of spears, repel the birds,
and do not suffer them to settle upon the fruits, and to break the
stalk, which is too tender to bear them; so also is it with regard
to the eyes. The hairs of the eyelids are ranged in front, and
answer the purpose of beards and spears; keeping dust and light
substances at a distance from the eyes, and any thing that might
incommode the sight; and not permitting the eyelids to be annoyed.
Another instance of wisdom, no less remarkable, is to be observed
in eyebrows. Who can help being struck by their position? For they
do not project to an immoderate degree, so as to obscure the sight;
nor do they retire farther back than is fitting; but in the same
manner as the eaves of a house, they stand out above, receiving the
perspiration as it descends from the forehead, and not permitting
it to annoy the eyes. For this purpose too there is a growth of
hair upon them, which serves by its roughness to stay what descends
from above, and affords the exact protection that is needed, and
contributes also much appearance of beauty to the eyes. Nor is this
the only matter of wonder! There is another thing also which is
equally so. How is it, I ask, that the hairs of the head increase,
and are cut off; but those of the eyebrows, not so? For not even
this has happened undesignedly, or by chance, but in order that
they might not darken the sight too much by becoming very long; an
inconvenience from which those suffer who have arrived at extreme
old age.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xiii-p21">8. And who could possibly trace out all the
wisdom which is manifested by means of the brain! For, in the first
place, He made it soft, since it serves as a fountain to all the
senses. Next, in order that it might not suffer injury owing to its
peculiar nature, He fortified it on every side with bones. Further;
that it might not suffer from friction, by the hardness of the
bones, He interposed a middle membrane: and not only a single one,
but also a second; the former being spread out on the under side of
the skull, but the latter enveloping the upper substance of the
brain, and the first being the harder of the two. And this was
done, both for the cause that has been mentioned, and in order that
the brain might not be the first to receive the blows inflicted
upon the head; but that these membranes first encountering them,
might free it from all injury, and preserve it unwounded. Moreover,
that the bone which covers the brain is not a single and continuous
one, but has many sutures on every side, is a circumstance which
contributes much to its security. For a ventilation of the vapours
that surround it may easily take place outward through these
sutures, so as to prevent it from being suffocated;<note place="end" n="1486" id="xix.xiii-p21.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xiii-p22"> This is an unfounded notion. What follows is true,
since a fracture usually stops at a suture (or joining) of the
skull, as a crack in glass does at a cross cut of the diamond.
τὸ βρ™γμα, above, is strictly the
parietal bone. See also Hom. V. fin. on Ep. to Heb.</p></note> and if a
blow should be inflicted upon it, on any particular point, the
damage does not extend to the whole. For if the bone had been one
and continuous, the stroke even when it fell upon one part, only,
would have injured the whole; but now, by its being divided into
many parts, this can never happen. For if one part should chance to
be wounded, only the bone that is situated near that part receives
injury, but all the rest remain unhurt; the continuity of the
stroke being intercepted by the division of the bones, and being
unable to extend itself to the adjacent parts. By reason of this
God hath constructed a covering for the brain of many bones; and
just as when one builds a house, he lays on a roof, and tiles upon
the upper part, so God hath placed these bones above upon the head,
and hath provided that the hairs should shoot forth, and serve as a
kind of cap for it.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xiii-p23">9. The very same thing also He hath done with
regard to the heart. For inasmuch as the heart has preeminence over
all the members in our body, and that the supreme power over our
whole life is entrusted to it, and death happens when it receives
but a slight blow; He hath fenced it about on every side with stiff
and hard bones, surrounding it by the protection of the
breast-bone<note place="end" n="1487" id="xix.xiii-p23.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xiii-p24"> θώρακος.</p></note> before,
and the blade-bones<note place="end" n="1488" id="xix.xiii-p24.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xiii-p25"> ὠμοπλ€ταις.</p></note> behind. And what He did with
respect to the membranes of the brain, He hath done in this
instance also. For in order that it might not be rubbed and pained
in striking against the hard bones which encompass it, in the
throbbing and quick pulsation to which it is subject in anger and
similar affections, He both interposed many membranes there, and
placed the lungs by <pb n="416" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_416.html" id="xix.xiii-Page_416" />the
side of it to act the part of a soft bed to these pulsations, so
that the heart may break its force on these without sustaining
injury or distress.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xiii-p26">But why do I speak of the heart, and of the brain,
when if any one will investigate even the very nails, he will see
the manifold wisdom of God displayed in these; as well by their
form, as by their substance and position. I might also have
mentioned why our fingers are not all equal, and many other
particulars besides; but to those who are inclined to attend, the
wisdom of God Who created us, will be sufficiently clear from what
has been said. Wherefore, leaving this department to be
investigated with diligence by those who are desirous of the task,
I shall turn myself to another objection.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xiii-p27">10. There are many forsooth, who, besides what
has been already referred to, bring forward this objection. If man
be the king of the brutes, why have many animals an advantage over
him in strength, agility, and fleetness? For the horse is swifter,
the ox is more enduring, the eagle is lighter, and the lion
stronger, than man. What then have we to reply to this argument?
Thus much; that from that circumstance we may especially discern
the wisdom of God and the honour which He has put upon us. A horse,
it is true, is swifter than man, but for making dispatch on a
journey, the man is better fitted than the horse. For a horse,
though the very swiftest and strongest that may be, can scarcely
travel two hundred stadia in a day;<note place="end" n="1489" id="xix.xiii-p27.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xiii-p28"> He must mean for a continuance, as the stadium was
rather less than our furlong. The word harnessing, ὑποζεύξας, seems to
imply a vehicle. It is very likely that the persons mentioned had
not the advantage of relays of draught horses. Some read here “a
thousand,” for “two thousand;” see note of Ducæus.</p></note> but a man, harnessing a number of
horses in succession, will be able to accomplish a distance of two
thousand stadia. Thus, the advantage which swiftness affords to the
horse, intelligence and art afford to the man in a much greater
excess. The man, it is true, has not feet so strong as the other,
but then he has those of the other which serve him as well as his
own. For not one of the brutes has ever been able to subjugate
another to his own use; but man has the range of them all; and by
that variety of skill which is given him of God, makes each of the
animals subservient to the employment best suited to him. For if
the feet of men had been as strong as those of horses, they would
have been useless for other purposes, for difficult ground, for the
summits of mountains, for climbing trees; for the hoof is usually
an impediment to treading in such places. So that although the feet
of men are softer than theirs, they are still adapted to more
various uses, and are not the worse for their want of strength,
while they have the power of the horse ministering to their aid,
and at the same time they have the advantage over him in variety of
tread. Again, the eagle has his light pinion; but I have reason and
art, by which I am enabled to bring down and master all the winged
animals. But if thou wouldest see my pinion too, I have one much
lighter than he; one which can soar, not merely ten or twenty
stadia, or even as high as heaven, but above heaven itself, and
above the heaven of heavens; even to “where Christ sitteth at the
right hand of God!”<note place="end" n="1490" id="xix.xiii-p28.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xiii-p29"> <scripRef passage="Col. iii. 1" id="xix.xiii-p29.1" parsed="|Col|3|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Col.3.1">Col. iii.
1</scripRef>. So again Hom. XV. (3).
Compare the lines in one of Wesley’s hymns,</p>

<p class="MsoEndnoteTextc52" id="xix.xiii-p30">“And on the eagle wings of
love,</p>

<p class="MsoEndnoteText" id="xix.xiii-p31">To joys celestial rise.”</p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xiii-p32">11. Again, the irrational animals have their weapons
in their own body; thus, the ox has his horns; the wild boar his
tusks; the lion his claws. But God hath not furnished the nature of
my body with weapons, but hath made these to be extraneous to it,
for the purpose of shewing that man is a gentle animal; and that I
have not always occasion to use my weapons, for from time to time I
lay these aside, and from time to time resume them. In order then
that I might be free and unfettered in this matter, not being at
all times compelled to carry my weapons, He hath made these to be
separate from my nature. For it is not only in our possessing a
rational nature that we surpass the brutes, but we also excel them
in body. For God has made this to correspond with the soul’s
nobility, and fitted to execute its commands. He has not, indeed,
made the body such as it is, without reason; but such as it ought
to be, as having to minister to a rational soul; so that if it were
not such as it is, the operations of the soul would be greatly
impeded: and this is manifest from diseases. For if this nice
adjustment of the body be diverted from its proper condition in
ever so small a degree, many of the soul’s energies are impeded;
as, for instance, if the brain should become too hot, or too cold.
So that from the body it is easy to see much of the Divine
Providence, not only because He made it at first better than it is
at present; nor because even now He hath changed it for a useful
purpose, but also because He will raise it again to much greater
glory.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xiii-p33">12. But, if thou art desirous to learn in a
different way what wisdom God hath shewn respecting the body, I
will mention that by which Paul seems most especially to be
constantly struck. But what is this? That He 
<pb n="417" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_417.html" id="xix.xiii-Page_417" />hath made the members to excel one another,
though not in the same things? Some He hath appointed to surpass
the rest in beauty, and some in strength. Thus, the eye is
beautiful, but the feet are stronger. The head is honourable, but
it cannot say to the feet, “I have no need of you.”<note place="end" n="1491" id="xix.xiii-p33.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xiii-p34"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. xii. 21" id="xix.xiii-p34.1" parsed="|1Cor|12|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.12.21">1 Cor.
xii. 21</scripRef>.</p></note> And this
may be seen too with regard to irrational animals; and the same in
all the relations of life. The king, for instance, has need of his
subjects, and the subjects of the king; just as the head has need
of the feet. And again, as to brutes; some are more powerful than
the rest; and some more beautiful. Some there are that delight us;
some that nourish; and some that clothe us. Thus the peacock
delights; and fowls and swine nourish; sheep and goats provide us
clothing; and the ox and ass share our labours. There are also
others which provide us with none of these, but which call our
powers into active exercise. Thus the wild animals increase the
strength of the hunters; and instruct our race by the fear which
they inspire, and render us more cautious; and for medical
purposes, they supply no small contributions from their bodies.<note place="end" n="1492" id="xix.xiii-p34.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xiii-p35"> See Hom. VIII. 1.</p></note> So that if
any one say to thee, “How art thou a lord of the brutes, whilst
afraid of the lion?” Answer him, “Things were not ordered in
this manner at the beginning, when I was in favour with God, when I
dwelt in Paradise. But when I had offended my Master, I fell under
the power of those who were my servants! Yet not even now entirely;
since I possess an art by which I overcome the wild animals.” So
also it happens in great houses; the sons, while they are yet under
age, are afraid of many of the servants; but when they have done
amiss, their dread is greatly heightened. And this we may say also
of serpents, and scorpions, and vipers; that they are formidable to
us by reason of sin.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xiii-p36">13. And not only as it regards our body, and
the various states of life, is this diversity observable; nor is it
confined to brutes; but it may be seen also in trees; and the
meanest of them may be observed to have an excellence above those
which are greater; so that all things are not alike in all, that
all may be necessary to us; and that we may perceive the manifold
wisdom of the Lord. Do not then lay blame on God on account of the
body’s corruptibleness, but for this the rather do Him homage,
and admire Him for His wisdom and His tender care; His wisdom, that
in so corruptible a body He hath been able to display such harmony;
His tender care that for the benefit of the soul He hath made it
corruptible, that He might repress her vanity, and subdue her
pride! Why then did He not make it thus from the beginning, asks
some one? It was, I reply, to justify Himself before thee by these
very works; and as much as to say by the result itself, “I called
thee to greater honour, but thou didst constitute thyself unworthy
of the gift, banishing thyself from Paradise! Nevertheless, I will
not even now despise thee, but I will correct thy sin, and bring
thee back<note place="end" n="1493" id="xix.xiii-p36.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xiii-p37"> Or, take thee up.</p></note> to heaven.
Therefore for thine own sake, I have permitted thee so long to
decay and suffer corruption, that in the fulness of time the
discipline of thy humility might be established; and that thou
mightest never more resume thy former conceit.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xiii-p38">14. For all these things then let us give
thanks to God who loveth man; and for His tender care over us,
render Him a recompense, that will also be profitable to ourselves;
and as regards the commandment which I so frequently discourse of
to you, let us use our utmost diligence! For I will not desist from
the exhortation until ye are amended: seeing that what we aim at is
not that we may address you seldom or frequently, but that we may
continue speaking till we have persuaded you. To the Jews when God
said by the prophet, “If ye fast for strife and debate, to what
purpose do ye fast for me?”<note place="end" n="1494" id="xix.xiii-p38.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xiii-p39"> <scripRef passage="Isa. lviii. 4, 5" id="xix.xiii-p39.1" parsed="|Isa|58|4|58|5" osisRef="Bible:Isa.58.4-Isa.58.5">Isa.
lviii. 4, 5</scripRef>.</p></note> And by us He saith to you, “If
ye fast unto oaths and perjuries, to what purpose do ye fast? For
how shall we behold the sacred Passover? How shall we receive the
holy Sacrifice? How shall we be partakers of those wonderful
mysteries by means of the same tongue with which we have trampled
upon God’s law, the same tongue with which we have contaminated
the soul? For if no one would dare to receive the royal purple with
filthy hands, how shall we receive the Lord’s Body with a tongue
that has become polluted! For the oath is of the wicked one, but
the Sacrifice is of the Lord. “What communion then hath light

<p class="c38" id="xix.xiv-p2">Thanksgiving to God for the pardon granted to the
offenders against the Emperor. Physical discourse on the Creation.
Proof that God, in creating man, implanted in him a natural law.
Duty of avoiding oaths with the utmost diligence.</p>

<p class="c9" id="xix.xiv-p3">1. <span class="c12" id="xix.xiv-p3.1">Yesterday</span> I said
“Blessed be God!” and to-day again I say the very same thing.
For although the evils we dreaded have passed away, we should not
suffer the memory of them to disappear; not indeed that we may
grieve, but that we may give thanks. For if the memory of these
terrors abide with us, we shall never be overtaken by the actual
experience of such terrors. For what need have we of the
experience, whilst our memory acts the part of a monitor? Seeing
then that God hath not permitted us to be overwhelmed in the flood
of those troubles when upon us, let us not permit ourselves to
become careless when these are passed away. Then, when we were sad,
He consoled us, let us give thanks to Him now that we are joyful.
In our agony He comforted us, and did not forsake us; therefore let
us not betray ourselves in prosperity by declining into sloth.
“Forget not,” saith one, “the time of famine in the day of
plenty.”<note place="end" n="1497" id="xix.xiv-p3.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xiv-p4"> <scripRef passage="Ecclesiasticus 18.25" id="xix.xiv-p4.1" parsed="|Sir|18|25|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Sir.18.25">Ecclus. xviii. 25</scripRef>.</p></note> Therefore
let us be mindful of the time of temptation in the day of relief;
and with respect to our sins let us also act in the same manner. If
thou hast sinned, and God hath pardoned thy sin, receive thy
pardon, and give thanks; but be not forgetful of the sin; not that
thou shouldest fret thyself with the thought of it, but that thou
mayest school thy soul, not to grow wanton, and relapse again into
the same snares.<note place="end" n="1498" id="xix.xiv-p4.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xiv-p5"> See on <scripRef passage="Heb. vi. 4" id="xix.xiv-p5.1" parsed="|Heb|6|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Heb.6.4">Heb. vi. 4</scripRef>, Hom. IX. (4).</p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xiv-p6">2. Thus also Paul did; for having said, “He
counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry,” he goes on to
add, “who was before a blasphemer, a persecutor, and
injurious.”<note place="end" n="1499" id="xix.xiv-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xiv-p7"> <scripRef passage="1 Tim. i. 12, 13" id="xix.xiv-p7.1" parsed="|1Tim|1|12|1|13" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.1.12-1Tim.1.13">1 Tim. i.

life of the servant,” saith he, “be openly exposed, so that the
lovingkindness of the Master be apparent. For although I have
received the remission of sins, I do not reject the memory of those
sins.” And this not only manifested the lovingkindness of the
Lord, but made the man himself the more illustrious. For when thou
hast learnt who he was before, then thou wilt be the more
astonished at him; and when thou seest out of what he came to be
what he was, then thou wilt commend him the more; and if thou hast
greatly sinned, yet upon being changed thou wilt conceive
favourable hopes from this instance. For in addition to what has
been said, such an example comforts those who are in despair, and
causes them again to stand erect. The same thing also will be the
case with regard to our city; for all the events that have happened
serve to shew your virtue, who by means of repentance have
prevailed to ward off such wrath, whilst at the same time they
proclaim the lovingkindness of God, who has removed the cloud that
was so threatening, in consequence of a small change of conduct,
and so raises up again all those who are sunk in despair, when they
learn, from our case, that 
<pb n="419" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_419.html" id="xix.xiv-Page_419" />he who looks upward for the Divine help, is not
to be overwhelmed, though innumerable waves should encompass him on
all sides.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xiv-p8">3. For who hath seen, who hath ever heard of
sufferings such as were ours? We were every day in expectation that
our city would be overturned from its foundations together with its
inhabitants. But when the Devil was hoping to sink the vessel, then
God produced a perfect calm. Let us not then be unmindful of the
greatness of these terrors, in order that we may remember the
magnitude of the benefits received from God. He who knows not the
nature of the disease will not understand the physician’s art.
Let us tell these things also to our children; and transmit them to
the remotest generations, that all may learn how the Devil had
endeavoured to destroy the very foundation of the city; and how God
was able visibly to raise it up again, when it was fallen and
prostrate; and did not permit even the least injury to befall it,
but took away the fear; and dispelled with much speed the peril it
had been placed in. For even through the past week we were all
expecting that our substance would be confiscated; and that
soldiers would have been let loose upon us; and we were dreaming of
a thousand other horrors. But lo! all these things have passed
away, even like a cloud or a flitting shadow; and we have been
punished only in the expectation of what is dreadful; or rather we
have not been punished, but we have been disciplined, and have
become better; God having softened the heart of the Emperor. Let us
then always and every day say, “Blessed be God!” and with
greater zeal let us give heed to our assembling, and let us hasten
to the church, from whence we have reaped this benefit. For ye know
whither ye fled at the first; whither ye flocked together; and from
what quarter our safety came. Let us then hold fast by this sacred
anchor; and as in the season of danger it did not betray us, so now
let us not leave it in the season of relief; but let us await with
exact attention the stated assemblies and prayers; and let us every
day give a hearing to the divine oracles. And the leisure which we
spent in busily running about after those who came from the
court,<note place="end" n="1500" id="xix.xiv-p8.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xiv-p9"> στρατοπ™δον.</p></note> whilst we
were labouring under anxiety in respect to the evils that
threatened us; this let us consume wholly in hearing the divine
laws, instead of unseasonable and senseless pastimes; lest we
should again reduce ourselves to the necessity of that sort of
occupation.<note place="end" n="1501" id="xix.xiv-p9.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xiv-p10"> That is, of being busy about the news from the
court and the Emperor, upon which the fate of the city
depended.</p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xiv-p11">4. On the three foregoing days, then, we have
investigated one method of acquiring the knowledge of God, and have
brought it to a conclusion; explaining how “the heavens declare
the glory of God;”<note place="end" n="1502" id="xix.xiv-p11.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xiv-p12"> <scripRef passage="Ps. xix. 1" id="xix.xiv-p12.1" parsed="|Ps|19|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.19.1">Ps. xix.

which is said by Paul; viz. “That the invisible things of Him
from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood
by the things that are made.”<note place="end" n="1503" id="xix.xiv-p12.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xiv-p13"> <scripRef passage="Rom. i. 20" id="xix.xiv-p13.1" parsed="|Rom|1|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.1.20">Rom. i.

creation of the world, and how by heaven, and earth, the sea, the
Creator is glorified. But to-day, after briefly philosophising on
that same subject, we will proceed to another topic. For He not
only made it,<note place="end" n="1504" id="xix.xiv-p13.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xiv-p14"> αὐτὴν, <i>
i.e</i>., τὴν κτίσιν, the
Creation.</p></note> but
provided also that when it was made, it should carry on its
operations; not permitting it to be all immoveable, nor commanding
it to be all in a state of motion. The heaven, for instance, hath
remained immoveable, according as the prophet says, “He placed
the heaven as a vault, and stretched it out as a tent over the
earth.”<note place="end" n="1505" id="xix.xiv-p14.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xiv-p15"> <scripRef passage="Isa. xl. 42" id="xix.xiv-p15.1" parsed="|Isa|40|42|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.40.42">Isa. xl.
42</scripRef>.</p></note> But, on
the other hand, the sun with the rest of the stars, runs on his
course through every day.<note place="end" n="1506" id="xix.xiv-p15.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xiv-p16"> Hom. IX. (3) (4), and notes. St. Chrys. on
<scripRef passage="Hebr. viii. 1" id="xix.xiv-p16.1" parsed="|Heb|8|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Heb.8.1">Hebr. viii. 1</scripRef>, Hom. XIV. (1), denies that the Heaven is either
moveable or spherical. Plato, and most others, thought that the
fixed stars moved with the whole solid firmament, but Philoponus
argues that a sphere moving round its axis has motion of
translation, and may be called fixed. See Mont. pref. to <i>Cosmas
Ægypt</i>., in Coll. <i>Nov. Patr</i>. t. ii.</p></note> And again, the earth is fixed, but
the waters are continually in motion; and not the waters only, but
the clouds, and the frequent and successive showers, which return
at their proper season. The nature of the clouds is one, but the
things which are produced out of them are different. For the rain,
indeed, becomes wine in the grape, but oil in the olive. And in
other plants is changed into their juices; and the womb of the
earth is one, and yet bears different fruits. The heat, too, of the
sun-beams is one, but it ripens all things differently; bringing
some to maturity more slowly, and others more quickly. Who then but
must feel astonishment and admiration at these things?</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xiv-p17">5. Nay, this is not the only wonder, that He
hath formed it with this great variety and diversity; but farther,
that He hath spread it before all in common; the rich and the poor,
sinners as well as the righteous. Even as Christ also declared:
“He maketh His sun to rise upon the evil and the good, and
sendeth His rain upon the just and unjust.”<note place="end" n="1507" id="xix.xiv-p17.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xiv-p18"> <scripRef passage="Matt. v. 45" id="xix.xiv-p18.1" parsed="|Matt|5|45|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.45">Matt. v.

world with various animals, and implanted divers dispositions in
the creatures, He commanded us to imitate some of these, and to
avoid others. For example; the ant is industrious, and
per<pb n="420" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_420.html" id="xix.xiv-Page_420" />forms a
laborious task. By giving heed then, thou wilt receive the
strongest admonition from this animal not to indulge in sloth, nor
to shun labour and toil. Therefore also the Scripture has sent the
sluggard to the ant, saying, “Go to the ant, thou sluggard,
emulate his ways, and be wiser than he.”<note place="end" n="1508" id="xix.xiv-p18.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xiv-p19"> <scripRef passage="Prov. vi. 6" id="xix.xiv-p19.1" parsed="|Prov|6|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Prov.6.6">Prov. vi.

This also we do in our families, when those who are older, and who
are considered superior, have done amiss, we bid them to attend to
thoughtful children. We say, “Mark such an one, who is less than
you, how earnest and watchful he is.” Do thou then likewise
receive from this animal the best exhortation to industry; and
marvel at thy Lord, not only because He hath made heaven and the
sun, but because He hath also made the ant. For although the animal
be small, it affords much proof of the greatness of God’s wisdom.
Consider then how prudent the ant is, and consider how God hath
implanted in so small a body, such an unceasing desire of working!
But whilst from this animal thou learnest industry; take from the
bee at once a lesson of neatness, industry, and social concord! For
it is not more for herself<note place="end" n="1510" id="xix.xiv-p20.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xiv-p21"> See Wordsworth’s <i>Vernal Ode</i>, <i>
Poems</i>, vol. 3. He however only speaks of her as “a statist
prudent to confer—upon the public weal.”</p></note> than for us, that the bee labours,
and toils every day; which is indeed a thing especially proper for
a Christian; not to seek his own things, but the things of others.
As then she traverses all the meadows that she may prepare a
banquet for another, so also, O man, do thou likewise; and if thou
hast accumulated wealth, expend it upon others; if thou hast the
faculty of teaching,<note place="end" n="1511" id="xix.xiv-p21.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xiv-p22"> λόγους διδασκαλίας, v.

7</scripRef>.</p></note> do not bury the talent, but bring
it out publicly for the sake of those who need it! Or if thou hast
any other advantage, become useful to those who require the benefit
of thy labours! Seest thou not that for this reason, especially,
the bee is more honoured than the other animals; not because she
labours, but because she labours for others? For the spider also
labours, and toils, and spreads out his fine textures over the
walls, surpassing the utmost skill of woman; but the creature is
without estimation, since his work is in no way profitable to us;
such are they that labour and toil, but for themselves! Imitate too
the simplicity of the dove! Imitate the ass in his love to his
master, and the ox also! Imitate the birds in their freedom from
anxiety! For great, great indeed is the advantage that may be
gained from irrational creatures for the correction of
manners.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xiv-p23">6. From these animals Christ also instructs
us, when He says, “Be ye wise as serpents, and harmless as
doves.”<note place="end" n="1512" id="xix.xiv-p23.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xiv-p24"> <scripRef passage="Matt. x. 16" id="xix.xiv-p24.1" parsed="|Matt|10|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.10.16">Matt. x.

animals, and such as these, learn to achieve virtue, and be

dog is devoid of shame. Hate, therefore, this kind of wickedness.
The fox also is crafty, and fraudulent. Emulate not this vice; but
as the bee, in flying over the meadows, does not choose every sort
of flower;<note place="end" n="1517" id="xix.xiv-p28.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xiv-p29"> π€ντα.</p></note> but
selecting that which is useful, leaves the rest; so also do thou;
and whilst surveying the whole race of irrational animals, if any
thing profitable may be drawn from these, accept it; the advantages
which they have naturally, make it thy business to practise of
thine own free choice. For in this respect also thou hast been
honoured of God; that what they have as natural advantages He hath
permitted thee to achieve of thy own free choice, in order that
thou mayest also receive a reward. For good works with them spring
not from free will, and reason, but from nature only. In other
words, the bee makes honey, not because it has learnt this by
reason and reflection, but because it is instructed by nature.
Because if the work had not been natural, and allotted to the race,
some of them assuredly would have been unskilled in their art;
whereas from the time that the world was first made, even to the
present day, no one hath observed bees resting from labour, and not
making honey. For such natural characteristics are common to the
whole race. But those things which depend on our free choice are
not common; for labour is necessary that they may be
accomplished.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xiv-p30">7. Take then all the best things, and clothe thyself
with them; for thou art indeed king of the irrationals; but kings,
if there be any <pb n="421" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_421.html" id="xix.xiv-Page_421" />thing
excellent possessed by their subjects, be it gold or silver, or
precious stones, or sumptuous vestments, usually possess the same
in greater abundance. From the creation also, learn to admire thy
Lord! And if any of the things thou seest exceed thy comprehension,
and thou art not able to find the reason thereof, yet for this
glorify the Creator, that the wisdom of these works surpasses thine
understanding. Say not, wherefore is this? or, to what end? for
everything is useful, even if we know not the reason of it. As
therefore, if thou goest into a surgery, and seest many instruments
lying before thee, thou wonderest at the variety of the implements
though ignorant of their use; so also act with respect to the
creation. Although thou seest many of the animals, and of the
herbs, and plants, and other things, of which thou knowest not the
use, admire the variety of these; and feel astonishment for this
reason at the perfect workmanship of God; that He hath neither made
all things manifest to thee, nor permitted all things to be
unknown. For He hath not permitted all things to be unknown, lest
thou shouldest say, that the things that exist are not of
providence. He hath not permitted all things to be known to thee,
lest the greatness of thy knowledge should excite thee to pride.
Thus at least it was that the evil demon precipitated<note place="end" n="1518" id="xix.xiv-p30.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xiv-p31"> ἐξετραχήλισεν (a word used of a horse who throws

uses it of elevating with pride, which may be intended here. As

man headlong and by means of the hope of greater knowledge,
deprived him of that he already possessed. Therefore also, a
certain wise man exhorts, saying, “Seek not out the things that
are too hard for thee; neither search the things that are too deep
for thee. But what is commanded thee, think thereupon with
reverence; for the greater part of His works are done in
secret.”<note place="end" n="1519" id="xix.xiv-p31.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xiv-p32"> <scripRef passage="Ecclesiasticus 3.21-23" id="xix.xiv-p32.1" parsed="|Sir|3|21|3|23" osisRef="Bible:Sir.3.21-Sir.3.23">Ecclus. iii. 21, 22,

“More things are shewed unto thee than men understand.” But
this he speaks for the purpose of consoling the man who is sad and
vexed, because he does not know all things; for even those things
he observes, which thou art permitted to know, greatly surpass
thine understanding; for thou couldest not have found them by
thyself, but thou hast been taught them of God. Wherefore be
content with the wealth given thee, and do not seek more; but for
what thou hast received give thanks; and do not be angry on account
of those things which thou hast not received. And, for what thou
knowest, give glory, and do not stumble at those things of which
thou art ignorant. For God hath made both alike profitably; and
hath revealed some things, but hidden others, providing for thy
safety.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xiv-p33">8. One mode, then, of knowing God, is that by the
creation, which I have spoken of, and which might occupy many days.
For in order that we might go over the formation of man only with
exactness, (and I speak of exactness such as is possible to us, not
of real exactness; since many as are the reasons we have already
given for the works of creation, many more of these there are,
ineffable, which God who made them knoweth, for of course we do not
know them all); in order then, I say, that we might take an exact
survey of the whole modelling of man; and that we might discover
the skill there is in every member; and examine the distribution
and situation of the sinews, the veins, and the arteries, and the
moulding of every other part; not even a whole year would suffice
for such a disquisition.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xiv-p34">9. For this reason, here dismissing this
subject; and having given to the laborious and studious an
opportunity, by what has been said, of going over likewise the
other parts of Creation; we shall now direct our discourse to
another point which is itself also demonstrative of God’s
providence. What then is this second point? It is, that when God
formed man, he implanted within him from the beginning a natural
law. And what then was this natural law? He gave utterance to
conscience within us; and made the knowledge of good things, and of
those which are the contrary, to be self-taught. For we have no
need to learn that fornication is an evil thing, and that chastity
is a good thing, but we know this from the first. And that you may

add, “since murder is an evil thing,” but simply said, “Thou
shall not kill;” for He merely prohibited the sin, without
teaching. How was it then when He said, “Thou shalt not kill,”
that He did not add, “because murder is a wicked thing.” The
reason was, that conscience had taught this beforehand; and He
speaks thus, as to those who know and understand the point.
Wherefore when He speaks to us of another commandment, not known to
us by the dictate of consciences He not only prohibits, but adds
the reason. When, for instance, He gave commandment <pb n="422" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_422.html" id="xix.xiv-Page_422" />respecting the Sabbath; “On
the seventh day thou shalt do no work;” He subjoined also the
reason for this cessation. What was this? “Because on the seventh
day God rested from all His works which He had begun to make.”<note place="end" n="1522" id="xix.xiv-p36.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xiv-p37"> <scripRef passage="Exod. xx. 10" id="xix.xiv-p37.1" parsed="|Exod|20|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Exod.20.10">Exod. xx.

purpose then I ask did He add a reason respecting the Sabbath, but
did no such thing in regard to murder? Because this commandment was
not one of the leading ones. It was not one of those which were
accurately defined of our conscience, but a kind of partial and
temporary one; and for this reason it was abolished afterwards.<note place="end" n="1524" id="xix.xiv-p38.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xiv-p39"> κατελύθη μετὰ

offered us instruction typically (αἰνιγματωδῶς), teaching us to dedicate

which are necessary and uphold our life, are the following; “Thou
shalt not kill; Thou shalt not commit adultery; Thou shalt not

enters into any instruction on the matter, but is content with the
bare prohibition.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xiv-p40">10. And not only from thence, but from another
consideration also, I will endeavour to shew you how man was
self-taught with respect to the knowledge of virtue. Adam sinned
the first sin; and after the sin straightway hid himself; but if he
had not known he had been doing something wrong, why did he hide
himself? For then there were neither letters, nor law, nor Moses.
Whence then doth he recognise the sin, and hide himself? Yet not
only does he so hide himself, but when called to account, he
endeavours to lay the blame on another, saying, “The woman, whom
Thou gavest me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.” And that
woman again transfers the accusation to another, viz. the serpent.
Observe also the wisdom of God; for when Adam said, “I heard Thy
voice, and I was afraid, for I was naked, and I hid myself,”<note place="end" n="1525" id="xix.xiv-p40.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xiv-p41"> <scripRef passage="Gen. iii. 10, 11, 12" id="xix.xiv-p41.1" parsed="|Gen|3|10|3|12" osisRef="Bible:Gen.3.10-Gen.3.12">Gen. iii.
10, 11, 12</scripRef>.</p></note> God does
not at once convict him of what he had done, nor say, “Why hast
thou eaten of the tree?” But how? “Who told thee,” He asks,
“that thou wast naked, unless thou hast eaten of that Tree of
which alone I commanded thee not to eat?” He did not keep
silence, nor did He openly convict him. He did not keep silence,
that He might call him forth to the confession of his crime. He did
not convict him openly, lest the whole might come from Himself, and
the man should so be deprived of that pardon which is granted us
from confession.<note place="end" n="1526" id="xix.xiv-p41.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xiv-p42"> See Hom. VIII. 2. He does not mean that this of
itself merits pardon; indeed the word is rather “allowance,” or
indulgence (συγγνώμη); but that it
is a condition of pardon, and a great means of recovery. See on
<scripRef passage="Heb. vi. 5" id="xix.xiv-p42.1" parsed="|Heb|6|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Heb.6.5">Heb. vi. 5</scripRef>, and Hooker, b. vi. c. iv. 16, where “Hom. <i>de Pœn.

openly the cause from whence this knowledge sprung, but he carried
on the discourse in the form of interrogation, leaving the man
himself to come to the confession.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xiv-p43">11. Again, in the case of Cain and Abel, the
same proceeding is observable. For, in the first place, they set
apart the fruits of their own labours to God. For we would shew not
from his sin only, but also from his virtue, that man was capable
of knowing both these things. Wherefore that man knew sin to be an
evil thing, Adam manifested; and that he knew that virtue was a
good thing, Abel again made evident. For without having learnt it
from any one, without having heard any law promulgated respecting
the first fruits, but having been taught from within, and from his
conscience, he presented that sacrifice. On this account I do not
carry the argument down to a later period; but I bring it to bear
upon the time of these earlier men, when there were as yet no
letters, as yet no<note place="end" n="1527" id="xix.xiv-p43.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xiv-p44"> Sav. rep. as yet.</p></note> law, nor as yet prophets and
judges; but Adam only existed with his children; in order that thou
mayest learn, that the knowledge of good and evil had been
previously implanted in their natures. For from whence did Abel
learn that to offer sacrifice was a good thing;<note place="end" n="1528" id="xix.xiv-p44.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xiv-p45"> See Davison’s “Inquiry into the Origin
and Intent of Primitive Sacrifice,” reprinted in his Remains,
where this view is maintained as at least probable, and freed from
some objections. Archbishop Magee, in his work on the Atonement,
vol. i. no. 41, vol. ii. no. 54, 58, &amp;c., maintains the
original, divine institution. It is difficult now to judge what may
have been likely to seem reasonable and natural to our first
parents, who had a stronger apprehension of natural things, as well
as a more sensible communion with God, than we. It may be observed,
that such a view does not interfere with the strictly typical
character of the sacrifice, because man is made in the image of
God, and many things which he does of mere nature, as well as moral
actions not specially enjoined, are typical, and represented as
typical in Holy Scripture. And again, sacrifice, if it originated
in God’s gift of reason, was certainly sanctioned, and endowed
with an atoning power, by His special laws. The prevailing neglect
of our Eucharistic oblation as such, and separating in thought our
partaking of the sacrifice of our Lord from the sacrament of the
altar, tend to obscure men’s views on this subject. It is,
however, difficult to conceive how the sacrifice of <i>animals</i>
should have occurred to man, without some divine indication beyond
the permission to use them for food. St. Chrys. on <scripRef passage="Gen. iv." id="xix.xiv-p45.1" parsed="|Gen|4|0|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.4">Gen. iv.</scripRef> Hom.
XVIII. (5), speaks of nothing more than an offering “out of our
possessions” as taught by natural conscience; and of Abel’s
offering being of the first-born, and of the best, as a proof of
his devotion. On this view the <i>type</i> would arise from the
divine permission of animal food.</p></note> that it was good to honour God,
and in all things to give thanks? “Why then?” replies some one,
“did not Cain bring his offering?” This man also did offer
sacrifice, but not in like manner. And from <pb n="423" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_423.html" id="xix.xiv-Page_423" />thence again the knowledge of
conscience is apparent. For when, envying him who had been
honoured, he deliberated upon murder, he conceals his crafty
determination. And what says he; “Come, let us go forth into the
field.”<note place="end" n="1529" id="xix.xiv-p45.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xiv-p46"> <scripRef passage="Gen. iv. 9" id="xix.xiv-p46.1" parsed="|Gen|4|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.4.9">Gen. iv. 9</scripRef>. This clause is added in the Vulgate as
well as the Septuagint. The Hebrew seems to present an hiatus after
רמאיו (<i>said</i> rather than <i>
spake</i>). The Targum of Jerusalem and that called of Jonathan
supply it, Tr. (The Samaritan and Syriac and Aquila also contain
this clause. Origen did not find it in the Hebrew, and Onkelos
omits it. Michælis quotes

Some render the word <i>told</i>, and refer it to what went
before.).</p></note> The
outward guise was one thing, the pretence of love; the thought
another, the purpose of fratricide. But if he had not known the
design to be a wicked one, why did he conceal it? And again, after
the murder had been perpetrated, being asked of God, “Where is
Abel thy brother?” he answers, “I know not; Am I my brother’s
keeper?” Wherefore does he deny the crime? Is it not evidently
because he exceedingly condemns himself. For as his father had hid
himself, so also this man denies his guilt, and after his
conviction, again says, “My crime is too great to obtain
pardon.”<note place="end" n="1530" id="xix.xiv-p46.3"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xiv-p47"> <scripRef passage="Gen. iv. 13" id="xix.xiv-p47.1" parsed="|Gen|4|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.4.13">Gen. iv.

<p class="c10" id="xix.xiv-p48">12. But it may be objected, that the Gentile
allows nothing of this sort. Come then, let us discuss this point,
and as we have done with respect to the creation, having carried on
the warfare against these objectors not only by the help of the
Scriptures, but of reason, so also let us now do with respect to
conscience. For Paul too, when he was engaged in controversy with
such persons, entered upon this head. What then is it that they
urge? They say, that there is no self-evident law seated in our
consciences; and that God hath not implanted this in our nature.
But if so, whence is it, I ask, that legislators have written those
laws which are among them concerning marriages, concerning murders,
concerning wills, concerning trusts, concerning abstinence from
encroachments on one another, and a thousand other things. For the
men now living may perchance have learned them from their elders;<note place="end" n="1531" id="xix.xiv-p48.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xiv-p49"> πρώτων, Lat. <i>

but 6 <span class="c12" id="xix.xiv-p49.1">mss</span>. agree. See Hom. IX. in St.
Matt. ed. Field.</p></note> and they
from those who were before them, and these again from those beyond?
But from whom did those learn who were the originators and first
enactors of laws among them? Is it not evident that it was from
conscience? For they cannot say, that they held communication with
Moses; or that they heard the prophets. How could it be so when
they were Gentiles? But it is evident that from the very law which
God placed in man when He formed him from the beginning, laws were
laid down, and arts discovered, and all other things. For the arts
too were thus established, their originators having come to the
knowledge of them in a self-taught manner.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xiv-p50">13. So also came there to be courts of
justice, and so were penalties defined, as Paul accordingly
observes. For since many of the Gentiles were ready to controvert
this, and to say, “How will God judge mankind who lived before
Moses? He did not send a lawgiver; He did not introduce a law; He
commissioned no prophet, nor apostle, nor evangelist; how then can
He call these to account?” Since Paul therefore wished to prove
that they possessed a self taught law; and that they knew clearly
what they ought to do; hear how he speaks; “For when the Gentiles
who have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law,
these having not the law, are a law unto themselves; which shew the
work of the law written in their hearts.”<note place="end" n="1532" id="xix.xiv-p50.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xiv-p51"> <scripRef passage="Rom. ii. 14, 15" id="xix.xiv-p51.1" parsed="|Rom|2|14|2|15" osisRef="Bible:Rom.2.14-Rom.2.15">Rom. ii.

conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the meanwhile
accusing, or else excusing one another. In the day when God shall

“As many as have sinned without law, shall perish without law;
and as many as have sinned in the law, shall be judged by the
law.”<note place="end" n="1534" id="xix.xiv-p52.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xiv-p53"> <scripRef passage="Rom. ii. 12" id="xix.xiv-p53.1" parsed="|Rom|2|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.2.12">Rom. ii.

means, “They shall perish without law?” The law not accusing
them, but their thoughts, and their conscience; for if they had not
a law of conscience, it were not necessary that they should perish
through having done amiss. For how should it be so if they sinned
without a law? but when he says, “without a law,” he does not
assert that they had no law, but that they had no written law,
though they had the law of nature. And again; “But glory, honour,
and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and
also to the Gentile.”<note place="end" n="1535" id="xix.xiv-p53.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xiv-p54"> <scripRef passage="Rom. ii. 10" id="xix.xiv-p54.1" parsed="|Rom|2|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.2.10">Rom. ii.

<p class="c10" id="xix.xiv-p55">14. But these things he spake in reference to
the early times, before the coming of Christ; and the Gentile he
names here is not an idolater, but one who worshipped God only;
unfettered by the necessity of Judaical observances, (I mean
Sabbaths, and circumcision, and divers purifications,) yet
exhibiting all manner of wisdom and piety.<note place="end" n="1536" id="xix.xiv-p55.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xiv-p56"> The term ῞Ελλην, “Gentile,” or literally “Greek,”
usually at that time meant idolater. Thus we find many works of the
Fathers “against the Greeks.” But on the passage referred to,
Hom. V. on Rom., he expressly includes Melchizedek and Job under
the name as there used. These expressions, therefore, indicate what
a man might be, though a Gentile, not what Gentiles usually were.
Observe also that his description applies only to those spoken of
in verse 10. But the being out of the Jewish Covenant applies also
to the Gentiles in verses 8 and 9.</p></note> And 
<pb n="424" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_424.html" id="xix.xiv-Page_424" />again, discoursing of such a worshipper, he
observes, “Wrath and indignation, tribulation and anguish, upon
every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of
the Gentile.”<note place="end" n="1537" id="xix.xiv-p56.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xiv-p57"> <scripRef passage="Rom. ii. 9" id="xix.xiv-p57.1" parsed="|Rom|2|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.2.9">Rom. ii.
9</scripRef>.</p></note> Again he
here calls by the name of Greek one who was free from the
observance of Judaic customs. If, then, he had not heard the law,
nor conversed with the Jews, how could there be wrath, indignation
and tribulation against him for working evil? The reason is, that
he possessed a conscience inwardly admonishing him, and teaching
him, and instructing him in all things. Whence is this manifest?
From the way in which he<note place="end" n="1538" id="xix.xiv-p57.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xiv-p58"> al. they.</p></note> punished others when they did
amiss; from the way in which he laid down laws; from the way in
which he set up the tribunals of justice. With the view of making
this more plain, Paul spoke of those who were living in wickedness.
“Who, knowing the ordinance of God, that they which commit such
things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but also consent
with them that practise them.”<note place="end" n="1539" id="xix.xiv-p58.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xiv-p59"> <scripRef passage="Rom. i. 32" id="xix.xiv-p59.1" parsed="|Rom|1|32|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.1.32">Rom. i.
32</scripRef>.</p></note> “But from whence,” says some
one, “did they know, that it is the will of God, that those who
live in iniquity should be punished with death?” From whence?
Why, from the way in which they judged others who sinned. For if
thou deemest not murder to be a wicked thing, when thou hast gotten
a murderer at thy bar, thou shouldest not punish him. So if thou
deemest it not an evil thing to commit adultery, when the adulterer
has fallen into thy hands, release him from punishment! But if thou
recordest laws, and prescribest punishments, and art a severe judge
of the sins of others; what defence canst thou make, in matters
wherein thou thyself doest amiss, by saying that thou art ignorant
what things ought to be done? For suppose that thou and another
person have alike been guilty of adultery. On what account dost
thou punish him, and deem thyself worthy of forgiveness? Since if
thou didst not know adultery to be wickedness, it were not right to
punish it in another. But if thou punishest, and thinkest to escape
the punishment thyself, how is it agreeable to reason that the same
offences should not pay the same penalty?</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xiv-p60">15. This indeed is the very thing which Paul
rebukes, when he says, “And thinkest thou this, O man, that
judgest them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou
shalt escape the judgment of God?”<note place="end" n="1540" id="xix.xiv-p60.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xiv-p61"> <scripRef passage="Rom. ii. 3" id="xix.xiv-p61.1" parsed="|Rom|2|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.2.3">Rom. ii.
3</scripRef>.</p></note> It is not, it cannot be possible;
for from the very sentence, he means, which thou pronouncest upon
another, from this sentence God will then judge thee. For surely
thou art not just, and God unjust! But if thou overlookest not
another suffering wrong, how shall God overlook? And if thou
correctest the sins of others, how will not God correct thee? And
though He may not bring the punishment upon thee instantly, be not
confident on that account, but fear the more. So also Paul bade
thee, saying, “Despisest thou the riches of His goodness, and
forbearance, and longsuffering, not knowing that the goodness of
God leadeth thee to repentance?”<note place="end" n="1541" id="xix.xiv-p61.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xiv-p62"> <scripRef passage="Rom. ii. 4" id="xix.xiv-p62.1" parsed="|Rom|2|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.2.4">Rom. ii.
4</scripRef>.</p></note> For therefore, saith he, doth he
bear with thee, not that thou mayest become worse, but that thou
mayest repent. But if thou wilt not, this longsuffering becomes a
cause of thy greater punishment; continuing, as thou dost,
impenitent. This, however, is the very thing he means, when he
says, “But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up
to thyself wrath against the day of wrath, and revelation of the
righteous judgment of God. Who will render to every man according
to his deeds.”<note place="end" n="1542" id="xix.xiv-p62.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xiv-p63"> <scripRef passage="Rom. ii. 5, 6" id="xix.xiv-p63.1" parsed="|Rom|2|5|2|6" osisRef="Bible:Rom.2.5-Rom.2.6">Rom. ii.

every man according to his works; for this reason He both implanted
within us a natural law, and afterwards gave us a written one, in
order that He might demand an account of sins, and that He might
crown those who act rightly. Let us then order our conduct with the
utmost care, and as those who have soon to encounter a fearful
tribunal; knowing that we shall enjoy no pardon, if after a natural
as well as written law, and so much teaching and continual
admonition, we neglect our own salvation.</p>

subject of oaths; but I feel ashamed. For to me, indeed, it is not
wearisome both by day and by night to repeat the same things to

should seem to condemn you of great listlessness, that you should
require continual admonition respecting so easy a matter. And I am
not only ashamed, but also in fear for you! for frequent
instruction to those who give heed, is salutary and profitable; but
to those who are listless, it is injurious, and exceedingly
perilous; for the oftener any one hears, the greater punishment
does he draw upon himself, if he does not practise what is told

different voice which Christ uttered, saying to him who had made
profit, “Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been

things.”<note place="end" n="1547" id="xix.xiv-p68.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xiv-p69"> <scripRef passage="Matt. xxv. 21" id="xix.xiv-p69.1" parsed="|Matt|25|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.25.21">Matt.

<p class="c10" id="xix.xiv-p70">17. And this voice we shall hear, if we shew
the same earnestness as he did. And we shall shew this earnestness,
if we do this which I say. When you depart, whilst what you have
heard is yet warm within you, exhort one another! And just as ye
each salute at parting, so let every one go from hence with an
admonition, and say to his neighbour, “Observe and remember that
thou keep the commandment;” and thus shall we assuredly get the
mastery. For when friends also dismiss one with such counsel; and
on one’s return home, one’s wife again admonishes one to the
same effect; and our word keeps its hold on you when alone; we
shall soon shake off this evil habit. I know, indeed, that ye
marvel why I am so earnest respecting this precept. But discharge
the duty enjoined, and then I will tell you. Meanwhile, this I say;
that this precept is a divine law; and it is not safe to transgress
it. But if I shall see it rightly performed, I will speak of
another reason,<note place="end" n="1548" id="xix.xiv-p70.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xiv-p71"> See Hom. XIV. (6).</p></note> which is
not less than this, that ye may learn that it is with justice I
make so much ado about this law. But it is now time to conclude
this address in a prayer. Wherefore, let us all say in common, “O
God, Who willest not the death of a sinner, but that he should be
converted and live; grant that we, having discharged this and every
other precept, may be found worthy so to stand at the tribunal of
Thy Christ, that having enjoyed great boldness, we may attain the
kingdom to Thy glory. For to Thee belongeth glory, together with
Thine only begotten Son, and the Holy Ghost, now and ever, and
world without end.” Amen.</p>

Feriam quartam</i>, the fourth day of the week. The day referred to
was probably one of the days of silence mentioned in the beginning
of Hom. XI., where, first line of sec. 2, read
“ourselves.”</p></note> and what in the present! On that
day how heavy was the gloom! How bright the calm of the present!
That was the day when that fearful tribunal was <pb n="426" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_426.html" id="xix.xv-Page_426" />set in the city, and shook the hearts
of all, and made the day to seem no better than night; not because
the beams of the sun were extinguished, but because that
despondency and fear darkened your eyes. Wherefore, that we may
reap the more pleasure, I wish to relate a few of the circumstances
which then occurred; for I perceive that a narrative of these
things will be serviceable to you, and to all who shall come
afterwards. Besides, to those who have been delivered from
shipwreck, it is sweet to remember the waves, and the tempest, and
the winds, when they are come into port. And to those who have
fallen into sickness, it is an agreeable thing, when the sickness
is over, to talk over with others the fevers by which they were
nearly brought to the grave. When terrors have passed away, there
is a pleasure in relating those terrors; the soul no longer fearing
them, but deriving therefrom more cheerfulness. The remembrance of
past evils always makes the present prosperity to appear more
strikingly.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xv-p5">2. When the greater portion of the city had
taken refuge from the fear and danger of that occasion, in secret
places, in deserts, and in hollows;<note place="end" n="1550" id="xix.xv-p5.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xv-p6"> φ€ραγγας, usually
“ravines.” There were, however, caves near Antioch.</p></note> terror besetting them in all
directions; and the houses were empty of women, and the forum of
men, and scarce two or three appeared walking together across it,
and even these going about as if they had been animated corpses: at
this period, I proceeded to the tribunal of justice, for the
purpose of seeing the end of these transactions; and there,
beholding the fragments of the city collected together, I marvelled
most of all at this, that although a multitude was around the
doors, there was the profoundest silence, as though there had been
no man there, all looking upon one another; not one daring to
enquire of his neighbour, nor to hear anything from him; for each
regarded his neighbour with suspicion; since many already, having
been dragged away, beyond all expectation, from the midst of the
forum, were now confined within. Thus we all alike looked up to
heaven, and stretched out our hands in silence, expecting help from
above, and beseeching God to stand by those who were brought to
judgment, to soften the hearts of the judges, and to make their
sentence a merciful one. And just as when some persons on land,
beholding others suffering shipwreck, cannot indeed go near to
them, and reach out the hand, and relieve their distress, being
kept back from them by the waves; yet away on the shore, with
outstretched hands and tears, they supplicate God that He may help
the drowning; so there in like manner, did all silently and
mentally call upon God, pleading for those at the tribunal, as for
men surrounded by the waves, that He would stretch out His hand,
and not suffer the vessel to be overwhelmed, nor the judgment of
those under trial to end in an utter wreck. Such was the state of
things in front of the doors; but when I entered within the court,
other sights I saw which were still more awful; soldiers armed with
swords and clubs, and strictly keeping the peace for the judges
within. For since all the relatives of those under trial, whether
wives, or mothers, or daughters, or fathers, stood before the doors
of the seat of justice; in order that if any one happened to be led
away to execution, yet no one inflamed at the sight of the calamity
might raise any tumult or disturbance; the soldiers drove them all
afar off; thus preoccupying their mind with fear.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xv-p7">3. One sight there was, more pitiable than all; a
mother, and a sister of a certain person, who was among those under
trial within, sat at the very vestibule of the court of justice,
rolling themselves on the pavement, and becoming a common spectacle
to all the bystanders; veiling their faces, and shewing no sense of
shame, but that which the urgency of the calamity permitted. No
maid servant, nor neighbour, nor female friend, nor any other
relative accompanied them. But hemmed in by a crowd of soldiers,
alone, and meanly clad, and grovelling on the ground, about the
very doors, they were in more pitiable case than those who were
undergoing judgment within, and hearing as they did the voice of
the executioners, the strokes of the scourge, the wailing of those
who were being scourged, the fearful threats of the judges, they
themselves endured, at every scourging, sharper pains than those
who were beaten. For since, in the confessions of others, there was
a danger of accusations being proved, if they heard any one
scourged that he might mention those who were guilty, and uttering
cries, they, looking up to heaven, besought God to give the
sufferer some strength of endurance, lest the safety of their own
relations should be betrayed by the weakness of others, while
incapable of sustaining the sharp anguish of the strokes. And
again, the same thing occurred as in the case of men who are
struggling with a tempest. For just as when they perceive the
violence of a wave lifting up its head from afar, and gradually
increasing, and ready to overwhelm the vessel, they are <pb n="427" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_427.html" id="xix.xv-Page_427" />almost dead with terror, before it
comes near the ship; so also was it with these. If at any time they
heard voices, and cries that reached them, they saw a thousand
deaths before their eyes, being in terror, lest those who were
urged to bear witness, giving way to their torments, should name
some one of those who were their own relatives. And thus, one saw
tortures both within and without. Those within the executioners
were tormenting; these women, the despotic force of nature, and the
sympathy of the affections. There was lamentation within, and
without! inside, on the part of those who were found guilty, and
outside on the part of their relatives. Yea, rather not these only,
but their very judges inwardly lamented, and suffered more severely
than all the rest; being compelled to take part in so bitter a
tragedy.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xv-p8">4. As for me, while I sat and beheld all this,
how matrons and virgins, wont to live in seclusion, were now made a
common spectacle to all; and how those who were accustomed to lie
on a soft couch, had now the pavement for their bed; and how they
who had enjoyed so constant an attendance of female servants and
eunuchs, and every sort of outward distinction, were now bereft of
all these things; and grovelling at the feet of every one,
beseeching him to lend help by any means in his power to those who
were undergoing examination, and that there might be a kind of
general contribution of mercy from all; I exclaimed, in those words
of Solomon, “Vanity of vanities, all is vanity.”<note place="end" n="1551" id="xix.xv-p8.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xv-p9"> <scripRef passage="Eccl. i. 2" id="xix.xv-p9.1" parsed="|Eccl|1|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Eccl.1.2">Eccl. i.
2</scripRef>.</p></note> For I saw
both this and another oracle fulfilled in every deed, which saith,
“All the glory of man is as the flower of grass. The grass
withereth, and the flower falleth away.”<note place="end" n="1552" id="xix.xv-p9.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xv-p10"> <scripRef passage="Isa. xlii. 6, 7" id="xix.xv-p10.1" parsed="|Isa|42|6|42|7" osisRef="Bible:Isa.42.6-Isa.42.7">Isa.
xlii. 6, 7</scripRef>.</p></note> For then indeed, wealth, and
nobility, and notoriety, and the patronage of friends, and kinship
and all worldly things, were found worthless; the sin, and
transgression of the law which had taken place, having put all
these succours to flight. And just as the mother of young birds,
when the nestlings have been carried away, coming and finding her
nest empty, is unable to rescue her captive brood; but by hovering
around the hands of the fowler, in this way displays her grief;
even so did these women then do, when their children were snatched
away from their dwellings, and shut up within, as it were in a net,
or a trap. They could not indeed come in and deliver the prisoners,
but they manifested their anguish by wallowing on the ground near
the very doors; by lamentation and groans; and by endeavouring to
approach as near as possible to those who had captured them. These
things then beholding, I cast in my mind That Dread Tribunal; and I
said within myself, “If now, when men are the judges, neither
mother, nor sister, nor father, nor any other person, though
guiltless of the deeds which have been perpetrated, can avail to
rescue the criminals; who will stand by us when we are judged at
the dread Tribunal of Christ? Who will dare to raise his voice? Who
will be able to rescue those who shall be led away to those
unbearable punishments. Notwithstanding they were the first men of
the city who were then brought to trial, and the very chief of the
nobility, yet they would have been glad if it could be granted them
to lose all their possessions, yea, if need were, their liberty
itself, so that they might continue to enjoy this present
life.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xv-p11">5. But to proceed. The day now hastening to
its close, and late<note place="end" n="1553" id="xix.xv-p11.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xv-p12"> βαθυτ€της, which seems
to imply darkness. See Luc. xxiv. 1.</p></note> evening arriving, and the final
sentence of the court being expected, all were in still greater
agony, and besought God that He would grant some delay and respite;
and incline the soul of the judges to refer the facts that had been
investigated to the decision of the Emperor; since perchance some
advantage might arise from this reference.<note place="end" n="1554" id="xix.xv-p12.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xv-p13"> Or. “delay.” ὑπ™ρθεσις. But ὑπερτίθεμαι is “to refer” in Herodotus, as

supplications<note place="end" n="1555" id="xix.xv-p13.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xv-p14"> λιταὶ. The term was
originally used of any kind of prayer, but about this time was
beginning to be applied to a special kind of penitential prayer.
St. Basil, A.D. 375, ep. 207 (al. 63), writes to the Neocæsareans
in defence of λιτανεῖαι, to which
they objected as newly introduced; and the prayers here mentioned
seem to be something distinct from the common service. See Bingham,
b. xiii. c. 1, sec. 10. The passage he quotes from St. Augustin,
Hom. CLXXII. <i>de Temp</i>. is attributed by the Benedictine
editor to Cæsarius, after some <span class="c12" id="xix.xv-p14.1">
mss</span>.</p></note> were sent
up to the Merciful God; imploring that He would save the remnants
of the city; and not suffer it entirely to be razed from its
foundations. Nor could one see any one joining in this cry but with
tears. Nevertheless, none of these things then moved the judges
within, although they heard. One thing only they considered, that
there might be a rigid enquiry into the deeds that had been
perpetrated.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xv-p15">6. At last having loaded the culprits with
chains, and bound them with iron, they sent them away to the prison
through the midst of the forum. Men that had kept their studs of
horses, who had been presidents of the games,<note place="end" n="1556" id="xix.xv-p15.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xv-p16"> ‡γωνοθ™τας. Those who bore this office were men
of distinction, and of wealth, as they usually furnished the
spectacles at their own expense. Such were the Asiarchs, mentioned

different offices of distinction which they had held, had their
goods confiscated, and seals might be seen placed upon all their
doors. <pb n="428" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_428.html" id="xix.xv-Page_428" />Their wives
also being ejected from their parents’ home, each had literally
to play the part of Job’s wife. For they went “wandering<note place="end" n="1557" id="xix.xv-p16.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xv-p17"> Chrysostom here alludes to the history of Job as
given in the Septuagint. Job’s wife is there made to address him

to house and from place to place, seeking a lodging.”<note place="end" n="1558" id="xix.xv-p17.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xv-p18"> <scripRef passage="Job. ii. 9" id="xix.xv-p18.1" parsed="|Job|2|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Job.2.9">Job. ii.

it was not easy for them to find, every one fearing and trembling
to receive, or to render assistance in any way to the relatives of
those who were under impeachment. Nevertheless, though such events
had happened, the sufferers were patient under all; since they were
not deprived of the present life. And neither the loss of wealth,
nor dishonour, nor so much public exposure, nor any other matter of
that nature, caused them vexation. For the greatness of the
calamity, and the circumstance of their having expected still worse
things, when they suffered these, had prepared the soul for the
exercise of a wise fortitude. And now they learnt, how simple a
thing is virtue for us, how easy and expeditious of performance,
and that from our neglect only it seems to be laborious. They who
before this time could not bear the loss of a little money with
meekness, now they were subject to a greater fear, although they
had lost all their substance, felt as if they had found a treasure,
because they had not lost their lives. So that if the sense of a
future hell took possession of us, and we thought of those
intolerable punishments, we should not grieve, even though for the
sake of the law of God we were to give both our substance, and our
bodies and lives too, knowing that we should gain greater things;
deliverance from the terrors that are hereafter.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xv-p19">7. Perchance the tragedy of all I have told you, has
greatly softened your hearts. Do not however take it amiss. For
since I am about to venture upon some more subtle thoughts and
require a more sensitive state of mind on your part, I have done
this intentionally, in order that by the terror of the description
your minds might have shaken off all listlessness, and withdrawn
themselves from all worldly cares, and might with the more
readiness convey the force of the things about to be spoken into
the depths of your soul.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xv-p20">Sufficiently indeed, then, our discourse of
late<note place="end" n="1559" id="xix.xv-p20.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xv-p21"> πρώην, which seems to
refer to the last Homily, as also χθšς at
the beginning. This reference may, however, include also Hom.
XI.</p></note> evinced to
you, that a natural law of good and evil is seated within us. But
that our proof of it may be more abundantly evident, we will again
to-day apply ourselves strenuously to the same subject of
discourse. For that God from the beginning, when He formed man,
made him capable of discriminating both these, all men make
evident. Hence when we sin, we are all ashamed at the presence of
our inferiors; and oftentimes a master, on his way to the house of
a harlot, if he then perceives any one of his more respectable
servants, turns back, reddening with shame, from this untoward
path. Again, when others reproach us, fixing on us the names of
particular vices, we call it an insult; and if we are aggrieved, we
drag those who have done the wrong to the public tribunal. Thus we
can understand what vice is and what virtue is. Wherefore Christ,
for the purpose of declaring this, and shewing that He was not
introducing a strange law, or one which surpassed our nature, but
that which He had of old deposited beforehand in our conscience,
after pronouncing those numerous Beatitudes, thus speaks; “All
things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so
to them.”<note place="end" n="1560" id="xix.xv-p21.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xv-p22"> <scripRef passage="Matt. vii. 12" id="xix.xv-p22.1" parsed="|Matt|7|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.7.12">Matt.

words,” saith He, “are not necessary, nor laws of great length,
nor a diversity of instruction. Let thine own will be the law. Dost
thou wish to receive kindness? Be kind to another. Dost thou wish
to receive mercy? Show mercy to thy neighbour. Dost thou wish to be
applauded? Applaud another. Dost thou wish to be beloved? Exercise
love. Dost thou wish to enjoy the first rank? First concede that
place to another. Become thyself the judge, thyself the lawgiver of
thine own life. And again; “Do not to another what thou
hatest.”<note place="end" n="1561" id="xix.xv-p22.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xv-p23"> <scripRef passage="Tobit iv. 16" id="xix.xv-p23.1" parsed="|Tob|4|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Tob.4.16">Tobit iv.

latter precept, he would induce to a departure from iniquity; by
the former, to the exercise of virtue. “Do not thou to
another,” he saith,<note place="end" n="1562" id="xix.xv-p23.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xv-p24"> So Sav.</p></note> “what thou hatest.” Dost thou
hate to be insulted? Do not insult another. Dost thou hate to be
envied? Envy not another. Dost thou hate to be deceived? Do not
deceive another. And, in a word, in all things, if we hold fast
these two precepts, we shall not need any other instruction. For
the knowledge of virtue He hath implanted in our nature; but the
practice of it and the correction He hath entrusted to our moral
choice.<note place="end" n="1563" id="xix.xv-p24.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xv-p25"> “The light of reason does not, any more
than that of Revelation, force men to submit to its authority.”

of Christianity to natural religion is investigated. See also his
Sermons, II. and III. on Human Nature, for the sense in which the
term nature is here used. See also Aristotle Eth. vi. 5, on
φρόνησις.</p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xv-p26">8. Perhaps what is thus said, is obscure; wherefore
I will again endeavour to make it more plain. In order to know that
it is a good thing to exercise temperance, we need <pb n="429" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_429.html" id="xix.xv-Page_429" />no words, nor instruction; for we
ourselves have the knowledge of it in our nature, and there is no
necessity for labour or fatigue in going about and enquiring
whether temperance is good and profitable; but we all acknowledge
this with one consent, and no man is in doubt as to this virtue. So
also we account adultery to be an evil thing, and neither is there
here any need of trouble or learning, that the wickedness of this
sin may be known; but we are all self-taught in such judgments; and
we applaud virtue, though we do not follow it; as, on the other
hand, we hate vice, though we practise it. And this hath been an
exceeding good work of God; that He hath made our conscience, and
our power of choice already, and before the action, claim kindred
with virtue, and be at enmity with wickedness.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xv-p27">9. As I said then, the knowledge of each of
these things resides within the conscience of all men, and we
require no teacher to instruct us in these things; but the
regulation of our conduct is left to our choice, and earnestness,
and efforts. And why was this? but because if He had made
everything to be of nature, we should have departed uncrowned and
destitute of reward; and even as the brutes, who receive no reward
nor praise for those advantages which they have naturally, so
neither should we enjoy any of these things; for natural advantages
are not the praise and commendation of those who have them, but of
the Giver. For this reason, then, He did not commit all to nature;
and again, He did not suffer our will to undertake the whole burden
of knowledge, and of right regulation; lest it should despair at
the labour of virtue. But conscience suggests to it what ought to
be done; and it contributes its own exertions for the
accomplishment. That it is a good thing to be temperate, we all
understand without difficulty; for the knowledge is of nature: but
we should not be able without difficulty, without bridling lust,
and employing much exertion, to practise the rule of temperance;
for this does not come to us by nature as the knowledge does, but
requires also a willing mind and earnestness. And not only in this
respect has He made the burden lighter for us, but also in another
way again, by letting even some good dispositions exist naturally
within us. For we are all naturally disposed to feel indignation
along with those who are contemptuously treated, (whence it arises
that we become the enemies of those who are insolent, though we
ourselves may have suffered no part of the grievance,) and to
sympathize in the pleasure of those who enjoy assistance and
protection; and we are overcome by the calamities of others, as
well as by mutual tenderness.<note place="end" n="1564" id="xix.xv-p27.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xv-p28"> καὶ seems to be out of
place. Without it the sense is, “are afflicted in the calamities
of others through mutual tenderness.” Or the true reading may be
καὶ τὴν, “and we have a mutual
tenderness,” but six <span class="c12" id="xix.xv-p28.1">mss</span>.
agree.</p></note> For although calamitous events may
seem to induce a certain pusillanimity,<note place="end" n="1565" id="xix.xv-p28.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xv-p29"> That is, on the part of those who witness the
calamity. In allusion to the disposition of many to forsake their
friends in adversity.</p></note> we entertain nevertheless a common
fondness for each other. And to this effect a certain wise man
speaks significantly; “Every animal loveth his like, and man his
neighbour.”<note place="end" n="1566" id="xix.xv-p29.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xv-p30"> <scripRef passage="Eccles. xiii. 19" id="xix.xv-p30.1" parsed="|Eccl|13|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Eccl.13.19">Eccles.

<p class="c10" id="xix.xv-p31">10. But God hath provided many other
instructors for us besides conscience; viz., fathers for children,
masters for servants, husbands for wives, teachers for pupils,
law-givers and judges for those who are to be governed, and friends
for friends. And frequently too we gain no less from enemies than
friends; for when the former reproach us with our offences, they
stir us up, even against our will, to the amendment of them. So
many teachers hath He set over us, in order that the discovery of
what is profitable, and the regulation of our conduct, might be
easy to us, the multitude of those things which urge us on toward
it not permitting us to fall away from what is expedient for us.
For although we should despise parents, yet while we fear
magistrates, we shall in any case be more submissive than
otherwise. And though we may set them at nought<note place="end" n="1567" id="xix.xv-p31.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xv-p32"> διαπτύσωμεν.</p></note> when we sin, we can never escape
the rebuke of conscience: and if we dishonour and repel this, yet
whilst fearing the opinion of the many, we shall be the better for
it. And though we are destitute of shame with regard to this, the
fear of the laws will press on us so as to restrain us, however
reluctantly.</p>

wickedness. Beside all these too; sicknesses and calamities
instruct us. For poverty restrains, and losses sober us, and danger
subdues us, and there are many other things of this sort. Doth
neither father, nor teacher, nor prince, nor lawgiver, nor
judge <pb n="430" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_430.html" id="xix.xv-Page_430" />make thee fear?
Doth no friend move thee to shame, nor enemy sting thee? Doth no
master chastise? Doth no husband instruct? Doth no conscience
correct thee? Still, when bodily sickness comes, it often sets all
right; and a loss has made the audacious man to become gentle. And
what is more than this, heavy misfortunes, which befal not only
ourselves but others too, are often of great advantage to us; and
we who ourselves suffered nothing, yet beholding others enduring
punishment, have been no less sobered by it than they.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xv-p38">12. And with respect to right deeds, any one
may see that this happens; for as when the bad are punished others
become better, so whenever the good achieve any thing right, many
are urged onward to a similar zeal: a thing which hath also taken
place with respect to the avoiding of oaths. For many persons,
observing that others had laid aside the evil practice of oaths,
took a pattern from their diligence, and got the better of the sin;
wherefore we are the more disposed to touch again on the subject of
this admonition. For let no one tell me that “many” have
accomplished this; this is not what is desired, but that “all”
should do so; and until I see this I cannot take breath.<note place="end" n="1569" id="xix.xv-p38.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xv-p39"> <i>i.e</i>., “to stop this exhortation;” an

not that this also happens with respect to the body; for if by
striking against any obstacle, we have only turned back a nail, the
whole body sympathizes with the member. Say not this; that only a
certain few have failed; but consider this point, that these few
being unreformed, will corrupt many others. Although there was but
one who had committed fornication among the Corinthians, yet Paul
so groaned as if the whole city were lost. And very reasonably, for
he knew that if that member were not chastened, the disease
progressing onward would at length attack all the rest. I saw, but
lately, in the court of justice, those distinguished men bound and
conducted through the forum; and while some were wondering at this
extraordinary degradation, others said there was nothing to wonder
at; for that, where there is matter of treason,<note place="end" n="1571" id="xix.xv-p40.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xv-p41"> καθοσίωσις, so
called as being against the <i>sacred</i> person of the Emperor.

not then much more true that rank must be of no avail where is
impiety?</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xv-p42">13. Thinking therefore of these things, let us
arouse ourselves; for if ye bring not your own endeavours to the
task, every thing on our part is to no purpose. And why so? Because
it is not with the office of teaching, as it is with other arts.
For the silversmith, when he has fabricated a vessel of any kind,
and laid it aside, will find it on the morrow just as he left it.
And the worker in brass, and the stone-cutter, and every other
artificer, will each again take his own work in hand, whatever it
is, just in the state he quitted it. But it is not so with us, but
altogether the reverse; for we have not lifeless vessels to forge,
but reasonable souls. Therefore we do not find you such as we leave
you, but when we have taken you, and with manifold labour moulded,
reformed you and increased your ardour on your departing from this
place, the urgency of business, besetting you on every side, again
perverts you, and causes us increased difficulty. Therefore, I
supplicate and beseech you to put your own hand to the work; and
when ye depart hence, to shew the same earnest regard for your own
safety, that I have here shewn for your amendment.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xv-p43">14. Oh! that it were possible that I could
perform good works as your substitute, and that you could receive
the rewards of those works! Then I would not give you so much
trouble. But how can I do this? The thing is impossible; for to
every man will He render according to his own works. Wherefore as a
mother, when she beholds her son in a fever, while she witnesses
his sufferings<note place="end" n="1572" id="xix.xv-p43.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xv-p44"> Or, throttlings, ‡γχομ™νῳ.</p></note> from
choking and inflammation, frequently bewails him, and says to him,
“O my son, would that I could sustain thy fever, and draw off its
flame upon myself!” so now I say, Oh! that by labouring as your
substitute, I could do good works for you all! But no, this is not
to be done. But of his own doings must each man give the account,
and one cannot see one person suffer punishment in the room of
another. For this reason I am pained and mourn, that on That Day,
when ye are called to judgment, I shall not be able to assist you,
since, to say the truth, no such confidence of speech with God
belongs to me. But even if I had much confidence, I am not holier
than Moses, or more righteous than Samuel; of whom it is said, that
though they had attained to so great virtue, they could not in any
way avail to assist the Jews; inasmuch as that people had given
themselves over to excessive negligence.<note place="end" n="1573" id="xix.xv-p44.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xv-p45"> <scripRef passage="Jer. xv. 1" id="xix.xv-p45.1" parsed="|Jer|15|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Jer.15.1">Jer. xv.

<span class="c17" id="xix.xvi-p1.1">Homily XIV.</span></p>

<p class="c38" id="xix.xvi-p2">After the whole people had been freed from all
distress, and had become assured of safety, certain persons again
disturbed the city by fabricating false reports, and were
convicted. Wherefore this Homily refers to that subject; and also
to the admonition concerning oaths; for which reason also, the
history of Jonathan, and Saul, and that of Jephthah, is brought
forward; and it is shewn how many perjuries result from one
oath.</p>

<p class="c9" id="xix.xvi-p3">1. <span class="c12" id="xix.xvi-p3.1">Not</span> a little did
the devil yesterday disturb our city; but God also hath not a
little comforted us again; so that each one of us may seasonably
take up that prophetic saying, “In the multitude of the sorrows
that I had in my heart, thy comforts have refreshed my soul.”<note place="end" n="1574" id="xix.xvi-p3.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xvi-p4"> <scripRef passage="Ps. xciv. 19" id="xix.xvi-p4.1" parsed="|Ps|94|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.94.19">Ps. xciv.
19</scripRef>.</p></note> And not
only in consoling, but even in permitting us to be troubled, God
hath manifested His tender care towards us. For to-day I shall
repeat what I have never ceased to say, that not only our
deliverance from evils, but also the permission of them arises from
the benevolence of God. For when He sees us falling away into
listlessness, and starting off from communion with Him, and making
no account of spiritual things, He leaves us for a while; that thus
brought to soberness, we may return to Him the more earnestly. And
what marvel is it, if He does this towards us, listless as we are;
since even Paul declares that with regard to himself and his
disciples, this was the cause of their trials? For inditing his
second Epistle to the Corinthians, he speaks thus: “We would not,
brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in
Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch
that we despaired even of life; but we had the sentence of death in
ourselves.”<note place="end" n="1575" id="xix.xvi-p4.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xvi-p5"> <scripRef passage="2 Cor. i. 8, 9" id="xix.xvi-p5.1" parsed="|2Cor|1|8|1|9" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.1.8-2Cor.1.9">2 Cor. i.
8, 9</scripRef>.</p></note> As though
he would say, “Dangers so great hung over us, that we gave up
ourselves for lost; and no longer hoped that any favourable change
would take place, but were altogether in expectation of death.”
For such is the sense of that clause, “We had the sentence of
death in ourselves.” But nevertheless, after such a state of
desperation, God dispelled the tempest, and removed the cloud, and
snatched us from the very gates of death. And afterwards, for the
purpose of shewing that his being permitted to fall into this
danger also was the result of much tender care for him, he mentions
the advantage which resulted from the temptations, which was, that
he might continually look to Him, and be neither high-minded, nor
confident. Therefore having said this, “We had the sentence of
death in ourselves;”<note place="end" n="1576" id="xix.xvi-p5.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xvi-p6"> <scripRef passage="2 Cor. i. 9" id="xix.xvi-p6.1" parsed="|2Cor|1|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.1.9">2 Cor. i.
9</scripRef>.</p></note> he adds also the reason; “That
we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which quickeneth the
dead.” For it is in the nature of trials to arouse us when we are
dozing, or falling down, and to stir us up, and make us more
religious. When, therefore, O beloved! thou seest a trial at one
time extinguished, and at another time kindled again, be not cast
down! Do not despond, but retain a favourable hope, reasoning thus
with thyself, that God does not deliver us into the hands of our
enemies either because He hates or abandons us, but because He is
desirous to make us more in earnest, and more intimate with
Himself.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xvi-p7">2. Let us not then be desponding; nor let us despair
of a change for the better; but let us hope that speedily there
will be a calm; and, in short, casting the issue of all the tumults
which beset us upon God, let us again handle the customary points;
and again bring forward our usual topic of instruction. For I am
desirous to discourse to you further concerning the same subject,
to the end that we may radically extirpate from your souls the
wicked practice of oaths. Wherefore it is necessary for me again to
have recourse to the same entreaty that I made before. For <pb n="432" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_432.html" id="xix.xvi-Page_432" />lately I besought you, that each one
taking the head of John, just cut off, and the warm blood yet
dripping from it, you would thus go home, and think that you saw it
before your eyes, while it emitted a voice, and said, “Abhor my
murderer, the oath!” What a rebuke did not effect, this an oath
effected; what a tyrant’s wrath was insufficient for, this the
necessity of keeping an oath brought about! And when the tyrant was
publicly rebuked in the hearing of all, he bore the censure nobly;
but when he had thrown himself into the fatal necessity caused by
oaths, then he cut off that blessed head. This same thing,
therefore, I entreat; and cease not entreating, that wherever we
go, we go bearing this head; and that we shew it to all, crying
aloud, as it does, and denouncing oaths. For although we were never
so listless and remiss, yet beholding the eyes of that head
fearfully glaring upon us, and threatening us if we swear, we
should be more powerfully kept in check by this terror, than by any
curb; and be easily able to restrain and avert the tongue from its
inclination toward oaths.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xvi-p8">3. There is not only this great evil in an
oath, that it punishes those who are guilty of it, both when
violated, and when kept; a thing we do not see take place with any
other sin; but there is another equally great evil attending it.
And what is that? Why that ofttimes it is utterly impossible even
for those who are desirous, and even make a point of it, to keep
their oath. For, in the first place, he who is continually
swearing, whether willingly or unwillingly; knowingly or
unknowingly; in jest or in earnest; being frequently carried away
by anger and by many other things, will most surely become
perjured. And no one can gainsay this; so evident and generally
allowed is the fact, that the man who swears frequently, must also
be a perjurer. Secondly, I affirm, that although he were not
carried away by passion, and did not become the victim of perjury<note place="end" n="1577" id="xix.xvi-p8.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xvi-p9"> τοῦτο π€θῃ, al. ποιῇ, become guilty of.</p></note>
unwillingly and unwittingly, yet by the very nature of the case he
will assuredly be necessitated both consciously and voluntarily to
perjure himself. Thus, oftentimes when we are dining at home, and
one of the servants happens to do amiss, the wife swears that he
shall be flogged, and then the husband swears the contrary,
resisting, and not permitting it. In this case, whatever they may
do, perjury must in any case be the result; for however much they
may wish and endeavour to keep their oaths, it is no longer
possible; but whatever happens, one or other of these will be
ensnared in perjury; or rather both in any case.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xvi-p10">4. And how, I will explain; for this is the
paradox. He who hath sworn that he would flog the man-servant or
maid-servant, yet hath afterwards been prohibited from this, hath
perjured himself, not having done what he hath sworn to do: and
also, he hath involved in the crime of perjury the party forbidding
and hindering the oath from being kept. For not only they who take
a false oath, but they who impose that necessity on others, are
liable to the same accusation. And not merely in houses, but also
in the forum we may see that this takes place; and especially in
fights, when those who box with one another swear things that are
contrary. One swears that he will beat, the other that he will not
be beaten. One swears that he will carry off the cloak, the other
that he will not suffer this. One that he will exact the money, the
other that he will not pay it. And many other such contradictory
things, those who are contentious take an oath to do. So also in
shops, and in schools, it may generally be observed that the same
thing occurs. Thus the workman hath often sworn that he will not
suffer his apprentice<note place="end" n="1578" id="xix.xvi-p10.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xvi-p11"> τῷ μαθητῇ.</p></note> to eat or drink, before he has
finished all his assigned task. And so also the pedagogue has often
acted towards a youth; and a mistress towards her maid-servant; and
when the evening hath overtaken them, and the work hath remained
unfinished, it is necessary either that those who have not executed
their task should perish with hunger, or that those who have sworn
should altogether forswear themselves. For that malignant demon,
who is always lying in wait against our blessings, being present
and hearing the obligation of the oaths, impels those who are
answerable to indifference; or works some other difficulty; so that
the task being unperformed, blows, insults, and perjuries, and a
thousand other evils, may take place. And just as when children
drag with all their might a long and rotten cord in directions
opposite to each other; if the cord snaps in the middle, they all
fall flat upon their backs, and some strike their heads, and some
another part of the body; so also they who each engage with an oath
to perform things that are contrary, when the oath is broken by the
necessity of the case, both parties fall into the same gulf of
perjury: these by actually perjuring themselves, and those by
affording the occasion of perjury to the others.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xvi-p12">5. That this also may be rendered evident, <pb n="433" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_433.html" id="xix.xvi-Page_433" />not only from what happens every day
in private houses, and the places of public concourse, but from the
Scriptures themselves, I will relate to you a piece of ancient
history, which bears upon what has been said. Once, when the Jews
had been invaded by their enemies, and Jonathan (now he was the son
of Saul) had slaughtered some, and put the rest to flight; Saul,
his father, being desirous to rouse the army more effectually
against the remainder; and in order that they might not desist
until he had subjugated them all, did that which was altogether
opposite to what he desired, by swearing that no one should eat any
food until evening, and until vengeance was taken of his enemies.
What, I ask, could have been more senseless than this? For when it
was needful that he should have refreshed those who were fatigued
and exhausted, and have sent them forth with renewed vigour against
their enemies, he treated them far worse than he had done their
enemies, by the constraint of an oath, which delivered them over to
excessive hunger. Dangerous, indeed, it is for any one to swear in
a matter pertaining to himself; for we are forcibly impelled to do
many things by the urgency of circumstances. But much more
dangerous is it by the obligation of one’s own oath, to bind the
determination of others; and especially where any one swears, not
concerning one, or two, or three, but an unlimited multitude, which
Saul then inconsiderately did, without thinking that it was
probable that, in so vast a number, one at least might transgress
the oath; or that soldiers, and soldiers too on campaign, are very
far removed from moral wisdom, and know nothing of ruling the
belly; more especially when their fatigue is great. He, however,
overlooking all these points, as if he were merely taking an oath
about a single servant, whom he was easily able to restrain,
counted equally on his whole army. In consequence of this he opened
such a door for the devil, that in a short time he framed, not two,
three, or four, but many more perjuries out of this oath. For as
when we do not swear at all, we close the whole entrance against
him, so if we utter but a single oath, we afford him great liberty
for constructing endless perjuries. And just as those who twist
skeins, if they have one to hold the end, work the whole string
with nicety, but if there is no one to do this, cannot even
undertake the commencement of it; in the same manner too the devil,
when about to twist the skein of our sins, if he could not get the
beginning from our tongues, would not be able to undertake the
work; but should we only make a commencement, while we hold the
oath on our tongue, as it were a hand, then with full liberty he
manifests his malignant art in the rest of the work, constructing
and weaving from a single oath a thousand perjuries.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xvi-p13">6. And this was just what he did now in the
case of Saul. Observe, however, what a snare is immediately framed
for this oath: “The army passed through a wood, that contained a
nest of bees, and the nest was in front of the people,<note place="end" n="1579" id="xix.xvi-p13.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xvi-p14"> Some <span class="c12" id="xix.xvi-p14.1">mss</span>.
read του ‡γρου, <i>of the
ground</i>, as LXX.</p></note> and the
people came upon the nest, and went along talking.”<note place="end" n="1580" id="xix.xvi-p14.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xvi-p15"> <scripRef passage="1 Sam. xiv. 26" id="xix.xvi-p15.1" parsed="|1Sam|14|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Sam.14.26">1 Sam.
xiv. 26</scripRef>, LXX.</p></note> Seest thou
what a pit-fall was here? A table ready spread, that the easiness
of access, the sweetness of the food, and the hope of concealment,
might entice them to a transgression of the oath. For hunger at
once, and fatigue, and the hour, (for “all the land,” it is
said, “was dining),”<note place="end" n="1581" id="xix.xvi-p15.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xvi-p16"> So LXX., <scripRef passage="1 Samuel 14.24-25" id="xix.xvi-p16.1" parsed="|1Sam|14|24|14|25" osisRef="Bible:1Sam.14.24-1Sam.14.25">1 Kings xiv. 24</scripRef> (<i>i.e</i>., 1 Samuel).
The clause in the Hebrew, corresponding to the Greek words
καὶ π‚σα ἡ γῆ ἠρίστα, is ואב ץראה-לבו רעיב, E.V. “And all they of
the land <i>came to a wood</i>.” It seems most likely that the
word ואב was thus taken, <i>
all the land went</i>, <i>i.e</i>., “to dinner,” as the
word רעי stands in LXX. for the
name of the wood.</p></note> then urged them to the
transgression. Moreover, the sight of the combs invited them from
without to relax the strain on their resolution. For the sweetness,
as well as the present readiness of the table, and the difficulty
of detecting the stealth, were sufficient to ensnare their utmost
wisdom. If it had been flesh, which needed boiling or roasting,
their minds would not have been so much bewitched; since while they
were delaying in the cookery of these, and engaged in preparing
them for food, they might expect to be discovered. But now there
was nothing of this kind; there was honey only, for which no such
labour was required, and for which the dipping of the tip of the
finger sufficed to partake of the table, and that with secresy.
Nevertheless, these persons restrained their appetite, and did not
say within themselves, “What does it concern us? Hath any one of
us sworn this? He may pay the penalty of his inconsiderate oath,
for why did he swear?” Nothing of this sort did they think; but
religiously passed on; and though there were so many enticements,
they behaved themselves wisely. “The people went on talking.”<note place="end" n="1582" id="xix.xvi-p16.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xvi-p17"> So LXX. Heb. שבר רלה
הנהו, E.V. <i>And behold the honey dropped</i>. This
difference has arisen in all probability from their <span class="c12" id="xix.xvi-p17.1">mss</span>. having read 
רבר instead of שבר. This seems a
probable conjecture: often, however, the variations of the LXX. can
be accounted for as being paraphrastic.</p></note> What is
the meaning of this word “talking?” Why, that for the purpose
of soothing their pain with words, they held discourse with one
another.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xvi-p18">7. What then, did nothing more come of <pb n="434" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_434.html" id="xix.xvi-Page_434" />this, when all the people had
acted so wisely? Was the oath, forsooth, observed? Not even so was
it observed. On the contrary, it was violated! How, and in what
way? Ye shall hear forthwith, in order that ye may also thoroughly
discern the whole art of the devil. For Jonathan, not having heard
his father take the oath, “put forth the end of the rod that was
in his hand, and dipped it in the honeycomb, and his eyes saw
clearly.”<note place="end" n="1583" id="xix.xvi-p18.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xvi-p19"> <scripRef passage="1 Sam. xiv. 27" id="xix.xvi-p19.1" parsed="|1Sam|14|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Sam.14.27">1 Sam.

who it was whom he impelled to break the oath; not one of the
soldiers, but the very son of him who had sworn it. For he did not
only desire to effect perjury, but was also plotting the slaughter
of a son, and making provision for it beforehand; and was in haste
to divide nature against her own self. and what he had done
aforetime in the case of Jephthah, that he hoped now again to
accomplish. For he likewise, when he had promised that the first
thing that met him, after a victorious battle, he would
sacrifice,<note place="end" n="1584" id="xix.xvi-p19.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xvi-p20"> <scripRef passage="Jud. xi. 31" id="xix.xvi-p20.1" parsed="|Judg|11|31|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Judg.11.31">Jud. xi.

the snare of child-murder; for his daughter first meeting him, he
sacrificed her and God did not forbid it. And I know, indeed, that
many of the unbelievers impugn us of cruelty and inhumanity on
account of this sacrifice; but I should say, that the concession<note place="end" n="1585" id="xix.xvi-p20.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xvi-p21"> He means the absence of <i>interference</i>,
for it was against the law of Moses.

case of this sacrifice was a striking example of providence and
clemency; and that it was in care for our race that He did not
prevent that sacrifice. For if after that vow and promise He had
forbidden the sacrifice, many also who were subsequent to Jephthah,
in the expectation that God would not receive their vows, would
have increased the number of such vows, and proceeding on their way
would have fallen into child-murder. But now, by suffering this vow
to be actually fulfilled,<note place="end" n="1586" id="xix.xvi-p21.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xvi-p22"> <scripRef passage="Jud. xi. 39" id="xix.xvi-p22.1" parsed="|Judg|11|39|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Judg.11.39">Jud. xi.

future. And to shew that this is true, after Jephthah’s daughter
had been slain, in order that the calamity might be always
remembered, and that her fate might not be consigned to oblivion,
it became a law among the Jews, that the virgins assembling at the
same season should bewail during forty<note place="end" n="1587" id="xix.xvi-p22.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xvi-p23"> Some <span class="c12" id="xix.xvi-p23.1">mss</span>. read <i>

place; in order that renewing the memory of it by lamentation, they
should make all men wiser for the future; and that they might learn
that it was not after the mind of God that this should be done, for
in that case He would not have permitted the virgins to bewail and
lament her. And that what I have said is not conjectural, the event
demonstrated; for after this sacrifice, no one vowed such a vow

<p class="c10" id="xix.xvi-p25">8. But the malignant demon was labouring hard
now again to produce such a tragedy. Therefore he impelled Jonathan
to the trespass. For if any one of the soldiers had transgressed
the law, it seemed to him no great evil that would have been done;
but now being insatiate of human ills, and never able to get his
fill of our calamities, he thought it would be no grand exploit if
he effected only a simple murder. And if he could not also pollute
the king’s right hand with the murder of his child, he considered
that he had achieved no great matter. And why do I speak of
child-murder? For he, the wicked one, thought that by this means he
should compass a slaughter even more accursed than that. For if he
had sinned wittingly, and been sacrificed, this would only have
been child-murder; but now sinning ignorantly, (for he had not
heard of the oath), if he had been slain, he would have made the
anguish of his father double; for he would have had both to
sacrifice a son, and a son who had done no wrong. But now to
proceed with the rest of the history; “When he had eaten,” it
is said, “His eyes saw clearly.”<note place="end" n="1589" id="xix.xvi-p25.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xvi-p26"> <scripRef passage="1 Sam. xiv. 28" id="xix.xvi-p26.1" parsed="|1Sam|14|28|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Sam.14.28">1 Sam.

and diffused much darkness over their eyes. Afterwards some one of
the soldiers, perceiving the action, saith, “Thy father sware an
oath upon all the people, saying, cursed be the man who eateth any
food to-day. And the people were faint. And Jonathan said, My
father hath made away<note place="end" n="1590" id="xix.xvi-p26.3"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xvi-p27"> LXX., ‡πήλλαχεν. Heb. רנע,

he mean by the word, “made away with?” Why, that he had ruined,

kept silence, and no one dared to bring forth the criminal; and
this became afterwards no small matter of blame, for not only are
those who break an oath, but those also who are privy to it and
conceal it, partakers of the crime.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xvi-p29">9. But let us see what follows; “And Saul

people to battle; and without His consent no one dared to engage in
the fight, and war was with them a matter of religion. For not from
weakness of body, but from their sins they were conquered, whenever
they were conquered; and not by might and courage, but by favour
from above they prevailed, whenever they did prevail. Victory and
defeat were also to them a means of training, and a school of
virtue. And not to them only, but to their adversaries; for this
was made evident to them too, that the fate of battle with the Jews
was decided not by the nature of their arms, but by the life and
good works of the warriors. The Midianites at least perceiving
this, and knowing that people to be invincible, and that to have
attacked them with arms and engines of war would have been
fruitless, and that it was only possible to conquer them by sin,
having decked out handsome virgins, and set them in the array,<note place="end" n="1594" id="xix.xvi-p31.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xvi-p32"> ἐπὶ

the soldiers to lasciviousness, endeavouring by means of
fornication to deprive them of God’s assistance; which
accordingly happened. For when they had fallen into sin, they
became an easy prey to all; and those whom weapons, and horses, and
soldiers, and so many engines availed not to capture,<note place="end" n="1595" id="xix.xvi-p32.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xvi-p33"> This may perhaps be said with a tacit

love, but only to ensnare; her kiss hath poison, and her mouth a
pernicious drug. And if this does not immediately appear, it is the
more necessary to avoid her on that account, because she veils that
destruction, and keeps that death concealed, and suffers it not to
become manifest at the first. So that if any one pursues pleasure,
and a life full of gladness, let him avoid the society of
fornicating women, for they fill the minds of their lovers with a
thousand conflicts and tumults, setting in motion against them
continual strifes and contentions, by means of their words, and all
their actions. And just as it is with those who are the most
virulent enemies, so the object of their actions and schemes is to
plunge their lovers into shame and poverty, and the worst
extremities. And in the same manner as hunters, when they have
spread out their nets, endeavour to drive thither the wild animals,
in order that they may put them to death, so also is it with these
women. When they have spread out on every side the wings<note place="end" n="1598" id="xix.xvi-p36.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xvi-p37"> A word often used metaphorically, here probably of
wide nets, spread out like wings.</p></note> of
lasciviousness by means of the eyes, and dress, and language, they
afterwards drive in their lovers, and bind them; nor do they give
over until they have drunk up their blood, insulting them at last,
and mocking their folly, and pouring over them a flood of ridicule.
And indeed such a man is no longer worthy of compassion but
deserves to be derided and jeered, since he is found more
irrational than a woman, and a harlot besides. Therefore the Wise
Man gives this word of exhortation again, “Drink waters from
thine own cistern, and from the fountain of thine own well.”<note place="end" n="1599" id="xix.xvi-p37.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xvi-p38"> <scripRef passage="Prov. v. 15" id="xix.xvi-p38.1" parsed="|Prov|5|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Prov.5.15">Prov. v.

“And the Priest said, Let us draw near unto God. And Saul asked

launch a thunderbolt, nor shake the earth; but what friends do to
friends, when treated contemptuously, this the Lord did towards the
servant. He only received him silently, speaking by His silence,
and by it giving utterance to all His wrath. This Saul understood,
and said, as it is recorded, “Bring near hither all the tribes of
the people, and know and see in whom this sin hath been this day.
For as the Lord liveth, Who hath saved Israel, though the answer be
against Jonathan my son, he shall surely die.”<note place="end" n="1603" id="xix.xvi-p42.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xvi-p43"> <scripRef passage="1 Sam. xiv. 38" id="xix.xvi-p43.1" parsed="|1Sam|14|38|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Sam.14.38">1 Sam.

Perceiving that his first oath had been transgressed, he does not
even then learn self-control, but adds again a second. Consider
also the malignity of the devil. For since he was aware that
frequently the son when discovered, and publicly arraigned, is able
by the very sight at once to make the father relent, and might
soften the king’s wrath, he anticipated his sentence by the
obligation of a second oath; holding him by a kind of double bond,
and not permitting him to be the master of his own determination,
but forcing him on every side to that iniquitous murder. And even
whilst the offender was not yet produced, he hath passed judgment,
and whilst ignorant of the criminal, he gave sentence. The father
became the executioner; and before the enquiry declared his verdict
of condemnation! What could be more irrational than this
proceeding?</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xvi-p44">12. Saul then having made this declaration,
the people were more afraid than before, and all were in a state of
great trembling and terror. But the devil rejoiced, at having
rendered them all thus anxious. There was no one, we are told, of
all the people, who answered. “And Saul said, Ye will be in
bondage, and I, and Jonathan my son, will be in bondage.”<note place="end" n="1604" id="xix.xvi-p44.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xvi-p45"> So LXX., as though there had stood רבעל for רבעל,

he means is to this effect; “You are aiming at nothing else, than
to deliver yourselves to your enemies, and to become slaves instead
of free men; whilst you provoke God against you, in not delivering
up the guilty person.” Observe also another contradiction
produced by the oath. It had been fitting, if he wished to find the
author of this guilt, to have made no such threat, nor to have
bound himself to vengeance by an oath; that becoming less afraid,
they might more readily bring the offender to light.<note place="end" n="1605" id="xix.xvi-p45.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xvi-p46"> εἰς μ™σον.</p></note> But under
the influence of anger, and great madness, and his former
unreasonableness, he again does that which is directly contrary to
what he desires. What need is there to enlarge? He commits the
matter to a decision by lot; and the lot falleth upon Saul, and
Jonathan; “And Saul said, Cast ye the lot between me and
Jonathan; and they cast the lot, and Jonathan was taken. And Saul
said to Jonathan, Tell me, what hast thou done? And Jonathan told
him, saying, I only tasted a little honey on the top of the rod
which is in my hand, and, lo! I must die.”<note place="end" n="1606" id="xix.xvi-p46.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xvi-p47"> <scripRef passage="1 Sam. xiv. 42, 43" id="xix.xvi-p47.1" parsed="|1Sam|14|42|14|43" osisRef="Bible:1Sam.14.42-1Sam.14.43">1 Sam.

would not have moved and turned to pity? Consider what a tempest
Saul then sustained, his bowels being torn with anguish, and the
most profound precipice appearing on either hand! But nevertheless
he did not learn self-control, for what does he say? “God do so
to me, and more also; for thou shalt surely die this day.”<note place="end" n="1607" id="xix.xvi-p47.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xvi-p48"> <scripRef passage="1 Sam. xiv. 44" id="xix.xvi-p48.1" parsed="|1Sam|14|44|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Sam.14.44">1 Sam.

again the third oath, and not simply the third, but one with a very

hurrying him on, constraining him and driving him to this impious
murder. Wherefore he did not suffer him to assign any future day
for the sentence, lest there should be any correction of the evil
by delay. And the people said to Saul, “God do so to us, and more
also, if he shall be put to death, who hath wrought this great
salvation in Israel. As the Lord liveth, there shall not an hair of
his head fall to the ground; because he hath wrought a merciful
thing from God to-day.”<note place="end" n="1609" id="xix.xvi-p49.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xvi-p50"> <scripRef passage="1 Sam. xiv. 45" id="xix.xvi-p50.1" parsed="|1Sam|14|45|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Sam.14.45">1 Sam.

the people also swore, and swore contrary to the king.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xvi-p51">13. Now recollect, I pray, the cord pulled by the
children, and breaking, and throwing on their backs those who pull
it. Saul swore not once or twice, but several times. The people
swore what was contrary, and strained in the opposite direction. Of
necessity then it followed, that the oath must in any wise be
broken through. For it were impossible that all these should keep
their oaths. And now tell me not of the event of this transaction;
but consider how many evils were springing from it; and how the
devil from thence was preparing the tragedy and usurpation of
Absalom. For if the king had chosen to resist, and to proceed to
the execution of his oath, the people would have been <pb n="437" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_437.html" id="xix.xvi-Page_437" />in array against him; and a
grievous rebellion<note place="end" n="1610" id="xix.xvi-p51.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xvi-p52"> τυραννὶς, here used for
“rebellion” or “usurpation,” as just above.</p></note> would have been set on foot. And
again, if the son consulting his own safety had chosen to throw
himself into the hands of the army, he would straightway have
become a parricide. Seest thou not, that rebellion, as well as
child-murder, and parricide, and battle, and civil war, and
slaughter, and blood, and dead bodies without number, are the
consequences of one oath. For if war had perchance broken out, Saul
might have been slain, and Jonathan perchance too, and many of the
soldiers would have been cut to pieces; and after all the keeping
of the oath would not have been forwarded. So that it is not for
thee to consider that these events did not occur, but to mark this
point, that it was the nature of the case to necessitate the
occurrence of such things. However, the people prevailed. Come
then, let us reckon up the perjuries that were the consequence. The
oath of Saul was first broken by his son; and again a second and a
third, concerning the slaying of his son, by Saul himself. And the
people seemed to have kept their oath. Yet if any one closely
examines the matter, they too all became liable to the charge of
perjury. For they compelled the father of Jonathan to perjure
himself, by not surrendering the son to the father. Seest thou how
many persons one oath made obnoxious to perjury,<note place="end" n="1611" id="xix.xvi-p52.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xvi-p53"> It seems that all actually remained under this
guilt. The only remedy would have been in Jonathan’s confessing
as soon as he knew his trespass, and an offering being made for
him, according to <scripRef passage="Lev. 5.4-6; 5.1; 4.22" id="xix.xvi-p53.1" parsed="|Lev|5|4|5|6;|Lev|5|1|0|0;|Lev|4|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Lev.5.4-Lev.5.6 Bible:Lev.5.1 Bible:Lev.4.22">Lev. v. 4–6, see also Lev. v. 1, iv.
22, and xxxvii. 2</scripRef>.</p></note> willingly and unwillingly; how
many evils it wrought, how many deaths it caused?</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xvi-p54">14. Now in the commencement of this discourse
I promised to shew that perjury would in any case result from
opposite oaths; but truly the course of the history has proved more
than I was establishing. It has exhibited not one, two, or three
individuals, but a whole people, and not one, two, or three oaths,
but many more transgressed. I might also make mention of another
instance, and shew from that, how one oath caused a still greater
and more grievous calamity. For one oath<note place="end" n="1612" id="xix.xvi-p54.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xvi-p55"> See Hom. XIX.</p></note> entailed upon all the Jews the
capture of their cities, as well as of their wives and children;
the ravages of fire, the invasion of barbarians, the pollution of
sacred things, and ten thousand other evils yet more distressing.
But I perceive that the discourse is running to a great length.
Therefore, dismissing here the narration of this history, I beseech
you, together with the beheading of John, to tell one another also
of the murder of Jonathan, and the general destruction of a whole
people (which did not indeed take place, but which was involved in
the obligation of the oaths); and both at home, and in public, and
with your wives, and friends, and with neighbours, and with all men
in general, to make an earnest business of this matter, and not to
think it a sufficient apology that we can plead custom.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xvi-p56">15. For that this excuse is a mere pretext, and that
the fault arises not from custom but from listlessness, I will
endeavour to convince you from what has already occurred. The
Emperor has shut up the baths of the city, and has given orders
that no one shall bathe; and no one has dared to transgress the
law, nor to find fault with what has taken place, nor to allege
custom. But even though in weak health perchance, men and women,
and children and old men; and many women but recently eased from
the pangs of childbirth; though all requiring this as a necessary
medicine; bear with the injunction, willingly or unwillingly; and
neither plead infirmity of body, nor the tyranny of custom, nor
that they are punished, whereas others were the offenders, nor any
other thing of this kind, but contentedly put up with this
punishment, because they were in expectation of greater evils; and
pray daily that the wrath of the Emperor may go no further. Seest
thou that where there is fear, the bond of custom is easily
relaxed, although it be of exceedingly long standing, and great
necessity? To be denied the use of the bath is certainly a grievous
matter. For although we be never so philosophic, the nature of the
body proves incapable of deriving any benefit for its own health,
from the philosophy of the soul. But as to abstinence from
swearing, this is exceedingly easy, and brings no injury at all;
none to the body, none to the mind; but, on the contrary, great
gain, much safety, and abundant wealth. How then is it any thing
but absurd, to submit to the greatest hardships, when an Emperor
enjoins it; but when God commands nothing grievous nor difficult,
but what is very tolerable and easy, to despise or to deride it,
and to advance custom as an excuse? Let us not, I entreat, so far
despise our own safety, but let us fear God as we fear man. I know
that ye shudder at hearing this, but what deserves to be shuddered
at is that ye do not pay even so much respect to God; and that
whilst ye diligently observe the Emperor’s decrees, ye trample
under foot those which are divine, and which have come down from
heaven; and consider diligence concerning these a secondary object.
For what apology will <pb n="438" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_438.html" id="xix.xvi-Page_438" />there be
left for us, and what pardon, if after so much admonition we
persist in the same practices. For I began this admonition at the
very commencement of the calamity which has taken hold of the city,
and that is now on the point of coming to an end; but we have not
as yet thoroughly put in practice even one precept. How then can we
ask a removal of the evils which still beset us, when we have not
been able to perform a single precept? How can we expect a change
for the better? How shall we pray? With what tongue shall we call
upon God? For if we perform the law, we shall enjoy much pleasure,
when the Emperor is reconciled to the city. But if we remain in the
transgression, shame and reproach will be ours on every hand,
inasmuch as when God hath freed us from the danger we have
continued in the same listlessness.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xvi-p57">16. Oh! that it were possible for me to
undress the souls of those who swear frequently, and to expose to
view the wounds and the bruises which they receive daily from
oaths! We should then need neither admonition nor counsel; for the
sight of these wounds would avail more powerfully than all that
could be said, to withdraw from their wickedness even those who are
most addicted to this wicked practice. Nevertheless, if it be not
possible to spread before the eyes the shameful state of their
soul, it may be possible to expose it to the thoughts, and to
display it in its rottenness and corruption. For as it saith, “As
a servant that is continually beaten will not be clear of a bruise,
so he that sweareth and nameth God continually will not be purified
of his sin.”<note place="end" n="1613" id="xix.xvi-p57.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xvi-p58"> <scripRef passage="Ecclesiasticus 23.10" id="xix.xvi-p58.1" parsed="|Sir|23|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Sir.23.10">Ecclus. xxiii. 10</scripRef>.</p></note> It is

all the world, even so this good work, having taken its root and
starting-point from hence, will make all men that inhabit the earth
your disciples; so that a double and treble reward may arise to
you, at once on account of your own good works, and of the
instruction afforded to others. This will be to you the brightest
of diadems! This will make your city a mother city, not on earth,
but in the heavens! This will stand by us at That Day, and bring us
the crown of righteousness; which God grant that we may all obtain,
through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, with
Whom to the Father, together with the Holy Spirit, be glory, now
and ever, and world without end. Amen.</p>

behoved us to enter on the subject of fasting; nor let any one
suppose that what I said was unseasonable.<note place="end" n="1617" id="xix.xvii-p5.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xvii-p6"> As being at the close of the week, when the fast
was just going to be intermitted, or at least relaxed.</p></note> For on the days of the fast,
counsel and admonition on that subject are indeed not at all
necessary; the very presence of these days exciting even those who
are the most remiss to the effort of fasting. But since many men,
both when about to enter upon the fast, as if the belly were on the
point of being delivered over to a sort of lengthened seige, lay in
beforehand a stock of gluttony and drunkenness; and again, on being
set at liberty, going forth as from a long famine and a grievous
prison, run to the 
<pb n="439" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_439.html" id="xix.xvii-Page_439" />table with unseemly greediness, just as if
they were striving to undo again the advantage gained through the
fast, by an excess of gluttony; it might have been needful, that
then as well as now, we should agitate the subject of temperance.
Nevertheless, we have neither lately said any thing of that kind,
neither shall we now speak upon it. For the fear of the impending
calamity suffices, instead of the strongest admonition and counsel,
to sober the soul of every one. For who is there so miserable and
degraded, as to be drunken in such a tempest? Who is there so
insensible, when the city is thus agitated, and such a shipwreck is
threatened, as not to become abstemious and watchful, and more
thoroughly reformed by this distress than by any other sort of
admonition and counsel? For discourse will not be able to effect as
much as fear does. And this very thing it is now possible to shew
from the events which have taken place. How many words then did we
spend before this in exhorting many that were listless, and
counselling them to abstain from the theatres, and the impurities
of these places! And still they did not abstain; but always on this
day they flocked together to the unlawful spectacles of the
dancers; and they held their diabolical assembly in opposition<note place="end" n="1618" id="xix.xvii-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xvii-p7"> Or, “right opposite.” 
‡ντικαθίστασαν. The word may be
taken to imply that those spectacles were held in the immediate
neighbourhood of the church. Stage plays, and players, and all who
took part in the public games, were excluded from communion. The
act, considered little short of idolatry, with which it was
connected, was denounced in several Councils. See Bingham, b. xvi.
c. 4, sec. 10.</p></note> to the
full congregation of God’s Church; so that their vehement shouts,
borne in the air from that place, resounded against the psalms
which we were singing here. But behold, now whilst we were keeping
silence, and saying nothing on the subject, they of themselves have
shut up their orchestra; and the Hippodrome has been left deserted!
Before this, many of our own people used to hasten to them; but now
they are all fled hither from thence to the church, and all alike
join in praising our God!</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xvii-p8">2. Seest thou what advantage is come of fear?
If fear were not a good thing, fathers would not have set tutors<note place="end" n="1619" id="xix.xvii-p8.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xvii-p9"> παιδαγωγοὺς. See Hom.
vi. 1, p. 114, where the “teachers” are different from these.
The paidagogos had the moral supervision of the child; part of his
duty was to conduct him daily to school. See <scripRef passage="Galatians iii. 24" id="xix.xvii-p9.1" parsed="|Gal|3|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gal.3.24">Galatians iii. 24</scripRef>,
revised version.</p></note> over their
children; nor lawgivers magistrates for cities. What can be more
grievous than hell? Yet nothing is more profitable than the fear of
it; for the fear of hell will bring us the crown of the kingdom.
Where fear is, there is no envy; where fear is, the love of money
does not disturb; where fear is, wrath is quenched, evil
concupiscence is repressed, and every unreasonable passion is
exterminated. And even as in a house, where there is always a
soldier under arms, no robber, nor house-breaker, nor any such evil
doer will dare to make his appearance; so also while fear holds
possession of our minds, none of the base passions will readily
attack us, but all fly off and are banished, being driven away in
every direction by the despotic power of fear. And not only this
advantage do we gain from fear, but also another which is far
greater. For not only, indeed, does it expel our evil passions, but
it also introduces every kind of virtue with great facility. Where
fear exists, there is zeal in alms-giving, and intensity of prayer,
and tears warm and frequent, and groans fraught with compunction.
For nothing so swallows up sin, and makes virtue to increase and
flourish, as a perpetual state of dread. Therefore it is impossible
for him who does not live in fear to act aright; as, on the other
hand, it is impossible that the man who lives in fear can go
wrong.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xvii-p10">3. Let us not then grieve, beloved, let us not
despond on account of the present tribulation, but let us admire
the well-devised plan of God’s wisdom. For by these very means
through which the devil hoped to overturn our city, hath God
restored and corrected it. The devil animated certain lawless men
to treat the very statues of the Emperor contemptuously, in order
that the very foundations of the city might be razed. But God
employed this same circumstance for our greater correction; driving
out all sloth by the dread of the expected wrath: and the thing has
turned out directly opposite to what the devil wished, by the means
which he had himself prepared. For our city is being purified every
day; and the lanes and crossings, and places of public concourse,
are freed from lascivious and voluptuous songs; and turn where we
will there are supplications, and thanksgivings, and tears, instead
of rude laughter; there are words of sound wisdom instead of
obscene language, and our whole city has become a Church, the
workshops being closed, and all being engaged throughout the day in
these general prayers; and calling upon God in one united voice
with much earnestness. What preaching, what admonition, what
counsel, what length of time had ever availed to accomplish these
things?</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xvii-p11">4. For this then let us be thankful, and let us not
be petulant or discontented; for that fear is a good thing, what we
have said hath made manifest. But hear Solomon thus uttering a
lesson of wisdom concerning it; Solomon, who was nourished in every
luxury, <pb n="440" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_440.html" id="xix.xvii-Page_440" />and enjoyed much
security. What then does he say? “It is better to go to the house
of mourning than to the house of laughter.”<note place="end" n="1620" id="xix.xvii-p11.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xvii-p12"> <scripRef passage="Eccles. vii. 3" id="xix.xvii-p12.1" parsed="|Eccl|7|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Eccl.7.3">Eccles.
vii. 3</scripRef>. This may be
a proverbial misquotation; St. Chrysostom afterwards adopts the
LXX., <i>house of drinking</i>; but his remarks are equally
suitable to the E.V. <i>feasting</i>. Laughter is mentioned in
verse 4.</p></note> What sayest thou, I ask? Is it
better to go where there is weeping, lamentation, and groans, and
anguish, and so much sadness, than where there is the dance, the
cymbals, and laughter, and luxury, and full eating and drinking?
Yes, verily, he replies. And tell me why is it so, and for what
reason? Because, at the former place, insolence is bred, at the
latter, sobriety. And when a person goes to the banquet of one more
opulent, he will no longer behold his own house with the same
pleasure, but he comes back to his wife in a discontented mood; and
in discontent he partakes of his own table; and is peevish towards
his own servants, and his own children, and every body in his
house; perceiving his own poverty the more forcibly by the wealth
of others. And this is not the only evil; but that he also often
envies him who hath invited him to the feast, and returns home
having received no benefit at all. But with regard to the house of
mourning, nothing of this sort can be said. On the contrary, much
spiritual wisdom is to be gained there, as well as sobriety. For
when once a person hath passed the threshold of a house which
contains a corpse, and hath seen the departed one lying speechless,
and the wife tearing her hair, mangling her cheeks, and wounding
her arms, he is subdued; his countenance becomes sad; and every one
of those who sit down together can say to his neighbour but this,
“We are nothing, and our wickedness is inexpressible!”<note place="end" n="1621" id="xix.xvii-p12.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xvii-p13"> This seems to be a proverbial saying, from the
next sentence.</p></note> What can
be more full of wisdom than these words, when we both acknowledge
the insignificance of our nature, and accuse our own wickedness,
and account present things as nothing? Giving utterance, though in
different words, to that very sentiment of Solomon—that sentiment
which is so marvellous and pregnant with Divine wisdom—“Vanity
of vanities, all is vanity.”<note place="end" n="1622" id="xix.xvii-p13.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xvii-p14"> <scripRef passage="Eccles. i. 2" id="xix.xvii-p14.1" parsed="|Eccl|1|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Eccl.1.2">Eccles.
i. 2</scripRef>.</p></note> He who enters the house of
mourning, weeps forthwith for the departed, even though he be an
enemy. Seest thou how much better that house is than the other? for
there, though he be a friend, he envies; but here, though he be an
enemy, he weeps. This is a thing which God requires of us above
all, that we should not insult over those who have occasioned us
grief. And not only may we gather these advantages, but others also
which are not less than these. For each one is also put in mind of
his own sins, and of the fearful Tribunal; of the great Account,
and of the Judgment; and although he may have been suffering a
thousand evils from others, and have a cause for sadness at home,
he will receive and take back with him the medicine for all these
things. For reflecting that he himself, and all those who swell
with pride, will in a little while suffer the same thing; and that
all present things, whether pleasant or painful, are transitory; he
thus returns to his house, disburdened of all sadness and envy,
with a light and buoyant heart; and hence he will hereafter be more
meek, and gentle, and benignant to all; as well as more wise; the
fear of things to come having made its way into his soul, and
consumed all the thorns.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xvii-p15">6. All this Solomon perceived when he said,
“It is better to go to the house of mourning than to the house of
drinking.”<note place="end" n="1623" id="xix.xvii-p15.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xvii-p16"> <scripRef passage="Eccles. vii. 3" id="xix.xvii-p16.1" parsed="|Eccl|7|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Eccl.7.3">Eccles.
vii. 3</scripRef>.</p></note> From the
one grows listlessness, from the other an earnest anxiety. From the
one, contempt; from the other, fear; a fear which conducts us to
the practice of every virtue. If fear were not a good thing, Christ
would not have expended such long and frequent discourses on the
subject of punishment, and vengeance to come. Fear is nothing less
than a wall, and a defence, and an impregnable tower. For indeed we
stand in need of much defence, seeing that there are many
ambushments on every side. Even as this same Solomon again says
admonishingly, “Perceive that thou goest in the midst of snares,
and that thou walkest on the battlements of cities.”<note place="end" n="1624" id="xix.xvii-p16.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xvii-p17"> <scripRef passage="Ecclesiasticus 9.13" id="xix.xvii-p17.1" parsed="|Sir|9|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Sir.9.13">Ecclus. ix. 13</scripRef>.</p></note> Oh with
how many good things is this saying pregnant! Yea, not less than
the former! Let us then, write it, each of us, upon our minds, and
carry it about ever in our memories, and we shall not easily commit
sin. Let us write it there, having first learnt it with the utmost
exactness. For he does not say, “Observe”<note place="end" n="1625" id="xix.xvii-p17.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xvii-p18"> βλ™πε, “see,” as
anything obvious.</p></note> that thou goest in the midst of
snares; but, “Perceive!” And for what reason did he say,
“Discern?”<note place="end" n="1626" id="xix.xvii-p18.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xvii-p19"> ™πίγνωθι, “perceive,” implies taking pains
to discover.</p></note> He tells
us that the snare is concealed; for this is indeed a snare, when
the destruction does not appear openly, and the injury is not
manifest, which lies hidden on all sides. Therefore he says,
“Perceive!” Thou needest much reflection and diligent scrutiny.
For even as boys conceal traps with earth, so the devil covers up
our sins with the pleasures of this life.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xvii-p20">7. But “perceive;” scrutinizing diligently;
<pb n="441" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_441.html" id="xix.xvii-Page_441" />and if any kind of gain falls
in thy way, look not only at the gain, but inspect it carefully,
lest somewhere death and sin lurk within the gain; and shouldest
thou perceive this, fly from it. Again, when some delight or
pleasure may chance to present itself, look not only at the
pleasure; but lest somewhere in the depth of the pleasure some
iniquity should lie enveloped, search closely, and if thou
discoverest it, hasten away! And should any one counsel, or
flatter, or cajole, or promise honours, or any other such thing
whatever, let us make the closest investigation; and look at the
matter on all sides, lest something pernicious, something perilous,
should perchance befall us through this advice, or honour, or
attention, and we run upon it hastily and unwittingly. For if there
were only one or two snares, the precaution would be easy. But now,
hear how Solomon speaks when he wishes to set forth the multitude
of these; “Perceive that thou goest in the midst of snares;” he
does not say, that thou “goest by” snares, but “in the
midst” of snares. On either side are the pit-falls; on either
side the deceits. One goes into the forum; one sees an enemy; one
is inflamed by the bare sight of him! one sees a friend honoured;
one is envious! One sees a poor man; one despises and takes no
notice of him! One sees a rich man; one envies him! One sees some
one injuriously treated; one recoils in disgust! One sees some one
acting injuriously; one is indignant! One sees a handsome woman,
and is caught! Seest thou, beloved, how many snares there are?
Therefore it is said, “Remember that thou goest in the midst of
snares.” There are snares in the house, snares at the table, and
snares in social intercourse. Very often a person unwittingly, in
the confidence of friendship, gives utterance to some particular of
those matters which ought not to be repeated again, and so great a
peril is brought about, that the whole family is thereby
ruined!</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xvii-p21">8. On every side then let us search closely
into these matters. Often has a wife, often have children, often
have friends, often have neighbours, proved a snare to the
unheeding! And why, it is asked, are there so many snares? That we
may not fly low, but seek the things that are above. For just as
birds, as long as they cleave the upper air, are not easily caught;
so also thou, as long as thou lookest to things above, wilt not be
easily captured, whether by a snare, or by any other device. The
devil is a fowler. Soar, then, too high for his arrows.<note place="end" n="1627" id="xix.xvii-p21.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xvii-p22"> See on <scripRef passage="Rom. iii. 31" id="xix.xvii-p22.1" parsed="|Rom|3|31|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.3.31">Rom. iii. 31</scripRef>, Hom. VIII.</p></note> The man
who hath mounted aloft will no longer admire any thing in the
affairs of this life. But as when we have ascended to the top of
the mountains, the city and its walls seem to us to be but small,
and the men appear to us to be going along upon the earth like
ants; so when thou hast ascended to the heights of spiritual
wisdom, nothing upon the earth will be able to fascinate thee; but
every thing, yea even riches, and glory, and honour, and whatever
else there be of that kind, will appear insignificant when thou
regardest heavenly things. According to Paul all the glories of the
present life appeared trifling, and more unprofitable than dead
things. Hence his exclamation, “The world is crucified unto
me.”<note place="end" n="1628" id="xix.xvii-p22.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xvii-p23"> <scripRef passage="Gal. vi. 14" id="xix.xvii-p23.1" parsed="|Gal|6|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gal.6.14">Gal. vi.

his admonition, “Set your affections on things above.”<note place="end" n="1629" id="xix.xvii-p23.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xvii-p24"> <scripRef passage="Col. iii. 2" id="xix.xvii-p24.1" parsed="|Col|3|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Col.3.2">Col. iii.

What kinds of things do you speak of pray? Where the sun is, where
the moon is? Nay, saith he. But where then? Where angels are? where
archangels? where the cherubim? where the seraphim are? Nay, saith
he. But where then? “Where Christ sitteth at the right hand of
God.”</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xvii-p25">9. Let us obey then, and let us think of this
continually, that even as to the bird caught in the snare, wings
are of no service, but he beats them about vainly, and to no
purpose; so also to thee there is no utility in thy reasonings,<note place="end" n="1630" id="xix.xvii-p25.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xvii-p26"> λογισμοῖ.</p></note> when once
thou art powerfully captivated by wicked lust, but struggle as much
as thou mayest, thou art captured! For this reason wings are given
to birds; that they may avoid snares. For this reason men have the
power of thinking; that they may avoid sin. What pardon then, or
what excuse will be ours, when we become more senseless than the
brutes? For the bird which has once been captured by the snare, yet
afterwards escaped, and the deer which has fallen into the net, but
has broken through it, are hard to be captured again with the like;
since experience becomes a teacher of caution to every one. But we,
though often snared in the same nets, fall into the same again; and
though honoured with reason, we do not imitate the forethought and
care of the irrational animals! Hence how often do we, from
beholding a woman, suffer a thousand evils; returning home, and
entertaining an inordinate desire, and experiencing anguish for
many days; yet, nevertheless, we are not made discreet; but when we
have scarcely cured one wound, we again fall into the same
mischief, and are caught by the same means; and for the sake of the
brief pleasure of a glance, we sustain a kind of lengthened and
continual torment. But if we learn con<pb n="442" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_442.html" id="xix.xvii-Page_442" />stantly to repeat to ourselves
this saying,<note place="end" n="1631" id="xix.xvii-p26.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xvii-p27"><i>i.e</i>., <scripRef passage="Ecclesiasticus 9.20" id="xix.xvii-p27.1" parsed="|Sir|9|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Sir.9.20">Ecclus. ix. 20</scripRef>.</p></note> we shall
be kept from all these grievous evils.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xvii-p28">10. The beauty of woman is the greatest snare.
Or rather, not the beauty of woman, but unchastened gazing! For we
should not accuse the objects, but ourselves, and our own
carelessness. Nor should we say, Let there be no women, but Let
there be no adulteries. We should not say, Let there be no beauty,
but Let there be no fornication. We should not say, Let there be no
belly, but let there be no gluttony; for the belly makes not the
gluttony, but our negligence. We should not say, that it is because
of eating and drinking that all these evils exist; for it is not
because of this, but because of our carelessness and
insatiableness. Thus the devil neither ate nor drank, and yet he
fell! Paul ate and drank, and ascended up to heaven! How many do I
hear say, Let there be no poverty! Therefore let us stop the mouths
of those who murmur at such things. For it is blasphemy to utter
such complaints. To such then, let us say, Let there be no meanness
of spirit. For poverty brings innumerable good things into our
state of life, and without poverty riches would be unprofitable.
Hence we should accuse neither the one nor the other of these; for
poverty and riches are both alike weapons which will tend to
virtue, if we are willing. As then the courageous soldier,
whichever weapon he takes, displays his own virtue, so the unmanly
and cowardly one is encumbered by either. And that thou mayest
learn that this is true, remember, I pray, the case of Job; who
became both rich, and likewise poor, and handled both these weapons
alike, and conquered in both. When he was rich, he said, “My door
was open to every comer.”<note place="end" n="1632" id="xix.xvii-p28.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xvii-p29"> <scripRef passage="Job xxxi. 32" id="xix.xvii-p29.1" parsed="|Job|31|32|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Job.31.32">Job xxxi.
32</scripRef>.</p></note> But when he had become poor,
“The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away. As it seemed good
unto the Lord, so hath it come to pass.”<note place="end" n="1633" id="xix.xvii-p29.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xvii-p30"> <scripRef passage="Job i. 21" id="xix.xvii-p30.1" parsed="|Job|1|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Job.1.21">Job i.
21</scripRef>. This last clause is
added in LXX. and Vulg.</p></note> When he was rich, he shewed much
hospitality; when he was poor, much patience. And thou, then,—art
thou rich? Display much bountifulness! Hast thou become poor? Shew
much endurance and patience! For neither is wealth an evil, nor
poverty in itself; but these things, either of them, become so
according to the free choice of those who make use of them. Let us
school ourselves then to entertain no such opinions on these
subjects; nor let us accuse the works of God, but the wicked choice
of men. Riches are not able to profit the little-minded: nor is
poverty able ever to injure the magnanimous.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xvii-p31">11. Let us then discern the snares, and walk
far off from them! Let us discern the precipices, and not even
approach them! This will be the foundation of our greatest safety
not only to avoid things sinful, but those things which seem indeed
to be indifferent, and yet are apt to make us stumble towards sin.
For example; to laugh, to speak jocosely, does not seem an
acknowledged sin, but it leads to acknowledged sin. Thus laughter
often gives birth to foul discourse, and foul discourse to actions
still more foul. Often from words and laughter proceed railing and
insult; and from railing and insult, blows and wounds; and from
blows and wounds, slaughter and murder. If, then, thou wouldest
take good counsel for thyself, avoid not merely foul words, and
foul deeds, or blows, and wounds, and murders, but unseasonable
laughter, itself, and the very language of banter; since these
things have proved the root of subsequent evils. Therefore Paul
saith, “Let no foolish talking nor jesting proceed out of thy
mouth.”<note place="end" n="1634" id="xix.xvii-p31.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xvii-p32"> A quotation made up of two passages, in <scripRef passage="Ephes. 4.29; 5.4" id="xix.xvii-p32.1" parsed="|Eph|4|29|0|0;|Eph|5|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Eph.4.29 Bible:Eph.5.4">Ephes. iv. 29, and Ephes. v. 4</scripRef>.</p></note> For
although this seems to be a small thing in itself, it becomes,
however, the cause of much mischief to us. Again, to live in luxury
does not seem to be a manifest and admitted crime; but then it
brings forth in us great evils,—drunkenness, violence, extortion,
and rapine. For the prodigal and sumptuous liver, bestowing
extravagant service upon the belly, is often compelled to steal,
and to seize the property of others, and to use extortion and
violence. If, then, thou avoidest luxurious living, thou removest
the foundation of extortion, and rapine, and drunkenness, and a
thousand other evils; cutting away the root of iniquity from its
extremity. Hence Paul saith, that “she who liveth in pleasure is
dead while she liveth.”<note place="end" n="1635" id="xix.xvii-p32.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xvii-p33"> <scripRef passage="1 Tim. v. 6" id="xix.xvii-p33.1" parsed="|1Tim|5|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.5.6">1 Tim. v.
6</scripRef>.</p></note> Again, to go to the theatres, or
to survey the horse-race, or to play at dice, does not seem, to
most men, to be an admitted crime; but it introduces into our life
an infinite host of miseries. For spending time in the theatres
produces fornication, intemperance, and every kind of impurity. The
spectacle of the horse-race also brings about fightings, railings,
blows, insults, and lasting enmities. And a passion for
dice-playing hath often caused blasphemies, injuries, anger,
reproaches, and a thousand other things more fearful
still.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xvii-p34">12. Therefore, let us not only avoid sins, but those
things too which seem to be indifferent, yet by degrees lead us
into these misdeeds. He, indeed, who walks by the side of a
precipice, even though he may not fall 
<pb n="443" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_443.html" id="xix.xvii-Page_443" />over, trembles; and very often he is
overset by this same trembling, and falls to the bottom. So also he
who does not avoid sins from afar, but walks near them, will live
in fear, and will often fall into them. Besides, he who eagerly
looks at strange beauties, although he may not commit adultery,
hath in so doing entertained lust; and hath become already an
adulterer according to the declaration of Christ;<note place="end" n="1636" id="xix.xvii-p34.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xvii-p35"> <scripRef passage="Matt. v. 28" id="xix.xvii-p35.1" parsed="|Matt|5|28|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.28">Matt. v.

by this very lust he is carried on to the actual sin. Let us then
withdraw ourselves far from sins. Dost thou wish to live soberly?
Avoid not only adultery, but also the licentious glance! Dost thou
wish to be far removed from foul words? Avoid not only foul words,
but also inordinate laughter, and every kind of lust. Dost thou
wish to keep far from committing murders? Avoid railing too. Dost
thou wish to keep aloof from drunkenness? Avoid luxury and
sumptuous tables, and pluck up the vice by the roots.</p>

here spoken? and for what reason is it in the form of a
“sickle,” and that a “flying sickle,” that vengeance is
seen to pursue the swearers? In order that thou mayest see that the
judgment is inevitable, and the punishment not to be eluded. For
from a flying sword some one might perchance be able to escape, but
from a sickle, falling upon the neck, and acting in the place of a
cord,<note place="end" n="1642" id="xix.xvii-p41.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xvii-p42"> From its hooked shape:

escape. And when wings too are added, what further hope is there of
safety? But on what account doth it pull down the stones and the
wood of the swearer’s house? In order that the ruin may be a
correction to all. For since it is necessary that the earth must
hide the swearer when dead; the very sight of his ruined house, now
become a heap, will be an admonition to all who pass by and observe
it, not to venture on the like, lest they suffer the like; and it
will be a lasting witness against the sin of the departed. The
sword is not so piercing as the nature of an oath! The sabre is not
so destructive as the stroke of an oath! The swearer, although he
seems to live, is already dead, and hath received the fatal blow.
And as the man who hath received the halter,<note place="end" n="1643" id="xix.xvii-p42.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xvii-p43"> σταρτίον.</p></note> before he hath gone out of the

<p class="c10" id="xix.xvii-p45">14. All this let us consider, and let us not put our
brethren on oath. What dost thou, O man? At the sacred table thou
exactest an oath, and where Christ lies slain, there thou slayest
thine own brother. Robbers, indeed, murder on the highways; but
thou slayest the son in the presence of the mother: committing a
murder more accursed than Cain himself; for he slew his brother in
solitude and only with present death; but thou slayest thy brother
in the midst of the church, and that with the deathless death that
is to come! For think you that the church was made for this
purpose, that we might swear? Yea, for this it was made, that we
might pray! Is the Table placed there, that we may make
adjurations? It is placed there to this end, that we may loose
sins, not that we may bind them. But thou, if thou heedest nothing
else, reverence at least that book, which thou reachest forth in
putting the oath; and open the Gospel, which thou takest in hand
when thou biddest swear; and when thou 
<pb n="444" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_444.html" id="xix.xvii-Page_444" />hearest what Christ there declares
concerning oaths, shudder and desist! What then does He there say
concerning oaths? “But I say unto you, Swear not at all.”<note place="end" n="1645" id="xix.xvii-p45.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xvii-p46"> <scripRef passage="Matt. v. 34" id="xix.xvii-p46.1" parsed="|Matt|5|34|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.34">Matt. v.

oath. Oh, what contempt! Oh, what outrage! For thou doest just the
same thing as if any one should bid the lawgiver, who prohibits
murder, become himself a party to the murder. Not so much do I
lament and weep, when I hear that some persons are slain<note place="end" n="1647" id="xix.xvii-p47.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xvii-p48"> σφαζομ™νους. The

highway, as I groan, and shed tears, and am horrified, when I see
any one coming near this Table, placing his hands upon it, and
touching the Gospels, and swearing! Art thou in doubt, I ask,
concerning money, and wouldest thou slay a soul? What gainest thou
to match the injury thou doest to thine own soul, and to thy
neighbour? If thou believest that the man is true, do not impose
the obligation of the oath; but if thou knowest him to be a liar,
do not force him to commit perjury. “But that I may have a full
assurance:” saith one. Verily, when thou hast not sworn him, then
thou wilt receive a good and full assurance.<note place="end" n="1648" id="xix.xvii-p48.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xvii-p49"> πληροφορία. This word

<p class="c10" id="xix.xvii-p50">15. For now, when thou hast returned home, thou wilt
be continually the prey of conscience, whilst reasoning thus with
thyself; “Was it to no purpose, then, that I put him upon his
oath? Was he not really perjured? Have I not become the cause of
the sin?” But if thou dost not put him upon his oath, thou wilt
receive much consolation on returning home, rendering thanks to
God, and saying, “Blessed be God, that I restrained myself, and
did not compel him to swear vainly, and to no purpose. Away with
gold! Perish the money!” for that which specially gives us
assurance is, that we did not transgress the law, nor compel
another to do it. Consider, for Whose sake thou didst not put any
one on his oath; and this will suffice thee for refreshment and
consolation. Often, indeed, when a fight takes place, we bear being
insulted with fortitude, and we say to the insulter, “What shall
I do with thee? Such an one hinders me, who is thy patron; he keeps
back my hands.” And this is sufficient to console us. So when
thou art about to put any one on his oath, restrain thyself; and
stop; and say to him who is about to swear, “What shall I do with
thee? God hath forbidden me to put any one on oath. He now holds me
back.” This suffices both for the honour of the Lawgiver, and for
thy safety, and for keeping him in fear who is ready to swear. For
when he seeth that we are thus afraid to put others on oath, much
more will he himself be afraid to swear rashly. Wouldest thou say
thus, thy return to thine own home would be with much fulness of
assurance. Hear God, therefore, in His Commandments, that He may
Himself hear thee in thy prayers! This word shall be written in
heaven, and shall stand by thee on the Day of Judgment, and shall
discharge many sins.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xvii-p51">16. This also let us consider not only with
respect to an oath, but to every thing. And when we are about to do
any good action for God’s sake, and it is found to bring loss
with it, let us look not merely at the loss connected with the
matter, but at the gain which we shall reap by doing it for God.
That is to say, Hath any one insulted thee? Bear it nobly! And thou
wilt do so, if thou thinkest not of the insult merely, but of the
dignity of Him who commands thee to bear it, and thou bearest it
meekly. Hast thou given an alms? Think not of the outlay, but of
the produce which arises from the outlay. Hast thou been mulcted of
money? Give thanks, and regard not only the pain which is the
result of the loss, but the gain which comes of thanksgiving. If we
thus regulate ourselves, none of those heavy events which may befal
us will give us pain; but from those things which may seem to be
grievous, we shall be even gainers, and loss will be sweeter and
more desired than wealth, pain than pleasure, and mirth and insult
than honour. Thus all things adverse will turn to our gain. And
here we shall enjoy much tranquillity, and there we shall attain
the kingdom of heaven; which God grant that we may all be deemed
worthy to obtain,<note place="end" n="1649" id="xix.xvii-p51.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xvii-p52"> Of remission of sins in the Holy Eucharist,

into such, it is not well to deprive ourselves of the mysteries,
but to come in the greater fear….inasmuch as remission also comes
to us from thence, when we abstain from what is in our power, and
are found not neglectful of the rest; beside spiritual aid for the
easier amendment of life. For all things that are added to us by
the death of Christ, the same it is just should be accomplished by
the symbols of His death.” Ed. Cramer, p. 222. This is implied in
our own service, in the prayer after communicating, and in the
final answers of the catechism. So too in the Roman Canon of the
Mass, “Deliver me, by this Thy Holy Body and Blood, from all my
iniquities and all evils.” Lit. of St. Basil, after the
Gospel.…“We pray and beseech Thy goodness, O Thou Lover of men,

needed teachers from without; and certain vagabonds and miscreants
have again unsettled this great city, and set it upon flight. With
what eyes shall we hereafter look upon the unbelievers, we who were
so timid and cowardly? With what tongue shall we speak to them, and
persuade them to exercise courage as to approaching evils, when we
became through this alarm more timid than any hare? “But what
could we do,” says some one, “we are but men!” This is indeed
the very reason why we ought not to be terrified, because we are
men, and not brutes. For these are scared by all manner of sounds
and noises; because they have not reasoning power, which is
adequate to dispel fear. But thou who hast been honoured with the
gift of speech and reason, how is it that thou sinkest to their
ignoble condition? Hath some one entered the city, and announced
the march of soldiers against it? Be not terrified, but leaving
him, bend the knee: call upon thy Lord: groan bitterly, and He will
keep off the dreaded event.</p>

encircled the city, and are about to plunder its wealth, flee to
thy Lord and say, “The Lord gave, the Lord hath taken away; as it
seemeth good to the Lord, so is it done. Blessed be the name of the
Lord for ever.” The experience of the actual events did not
terrify him; yet the mere report frightens thee. And how are we to

which is unreal; and trouble which is not visible; but he who
abides in a settled and tranquil condition of soul, breaks in
pieces even that which is real. Seest thou not pilots; when the sea
is raging, and the clouds are rushing together, and the thunders
are bursting forth, and all on board are in confusion, they seat
themselves at the helm without tumult or disturbance; giving
earnest heed to their own art, and considering how they may ward
off the effects of the approaching storm. Be these thy example; and
laying hold of the sacred anchor, the hope that is in God, remain
unshaken and immoveable. “Whosoever heareth these sayings of
mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man,
which built his house upon the sand; and the rain descended, and

rather, we were not only reduced to the condition of that foolish

winds had beaten upon it; but we, when there were no winds
striking, nor floods invading, nor blasts assaulting, before the
experience of disaster, were overturned by a mere rumour, and
dropped at once all the philosophy we were meditating.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xviii-p16">3. What think ye are now my thoughts? How should I
conceal,—yea, bury myself? How must I blush with shame? If I had
not been forcibly urged by our Fathers, I would not have arisen, I
would not have spoken, whilst my mind was darkened with sadness
because of your pusillanimity. But neither now have I been able to
recover myself; since anger and sorrow have laid such seige to my
soul. For who would not feel provoked and indignant, that after so
much teaching ye should need the instructions of Gentiles, that ye
might be comforted and persuaded to bear in a manly way the present
alarm. Pray ye therefore that free utterance may be given us in
opening our mouth; and that we may be able to shake off this
sadness, and to hold up again a little; for indeed this shame on
account of your pusillanimity hath greatly depressed our
spirits.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xviii-p17">4. Lately, I addressed to your Charity many things
concerning the snares lying on all sides of us; and concerning fear
and sadness, sorrow and pleasure; and also concerning the sickle
that flieth down upon the houses of swearers. Now, out of all these
many matters, I would have you especially to remember what I said
respecting the “winged sickle,” and its settling in the
swearer’s house; and pulling down the stones and the wood, and
consuming the whole mass. And withal, take heed to this; that it is
the extreme of folly to swear by taking the Gospels, and to turn
the very Law which forbids swearing into an oath; and that it is
better to suffer loss of property than to impose an oath on our
neighbours; since this is a great honour to be done to God. For
when thou sayest to God, “For thy sake I have not put such a one,
who hath robbed and injured me, on his oath,” God will pay thee
back a great recompense on account of this honour, both here and
hereafter. Say these things to others, and observe them also
yourselves. I know that in this place we become more reverent, and
lay aside every evil habit. But what is to be aimed at is, not that
we be lovers of wisdom here only, but that when we depart, we may
take this reverence out with us, where we especially need it. For
those who carry water do not merely have their vessels full when
near the fountain, and empty them when they reach home, but there
they put them away with especial caution, that they may not be
overturned, and their labours rendered useless. Let us all imitate
these persons; and when we come home, let us strictly retain what
has been spoken; since if ye here have gotten full, but return home
empty, having the vessels of your understandings destitute of what
ye have heard, there will be no advantage from your replenishment
here. Shew me not the wrestler in the place of exercise, but of
actual contest; and religion not at the season of hearing, but at
the season of practice.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xviii-p18">5. Thou applaudest what is said now. When thou
art required to swear, then remember all these things. If ye
quickly accomplish this law, we will advance our teaching to other
and greater things. Lo! this is the second year that I am
discoursing to your Charity; and I have not yet been able to
explain a hundred lines<note place="end" n="1661" id="xix.xviii-p18.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xviii-p19"> στίχοι. Lines, or
sentences. The ancients had two kind of verses, one of which they
called στίχοι, and the other ¿Ðματα. The stichoi were lines that contained a
certain number of letters, and were not limited by the sense as our
modern verses. The Codex Bezæ and Alex. are so divided into parts,
shorter than verses.</p></note> of the Scriptures. And the reason
is, that ye need to learn of us what ye might reduce to practice at
home, and of yourselves; and thus the greater part of our
exhortation is consumed on ethical discourse. But this ought not to
have been so; the regulation of manners you ought to <pb n="447" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_447.html" id="xix.xviii-Page_447" />have learnt at home, and of
yourselves; but the sense of the Scriptures, and the speculations
upon them, you might commit to us. If, however, it were necessary
that you should hear such things of us, there was no need of more
than one day: for what there is to be said is of no diversified or
difficult character, or such as requires any elaboration. For when
God declares His sentence, subtle arguments are unseasonable. God
hath said, “Thou shalt not swear.” Do not then demand of me the
reasons of this. It is a royal law. He who established it, knows
the reason of the law. If it had not been profitable, He would not
have forbidden it. Kings bring in laws, and not all perchance
profitable; for they are men, and cannot be competent to discover
what is useful, like God. Nevertheless, we obey them. Whether we
marry, or make wills, or are about to purchase servants, or houses,
or fields, or to do any other act, we do these things not according
to our own mind, but according to the laws which they ordain; and
we are not entirely at liberty to dispose of the things which
concern ourselves according to our own minds; but in many cases we
are subject to their will; and should we do any thing that is
contrary to their judgment, it becomes invalid and useless. So then
tell me, are we to pay so much respect to the laws of men, and
trample under foot the law of God? What defence, or what pardon can
such conduct be worthy of? He hath said, “Thou shalt not
swear.” In order that thou mayest do and speak all things with
safety, do not in practice lay down a law contrary to His.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xviii-p20">6. But enough of these matters. Let us now
proceed to lay before you one sentence of those which have been
read to-day, and thus end this discourse. “Paul, a prisoner of
Jesus Christ,” saith he, “and Timothy the brother.”<note place="end" n="1662" id="xix.xviii-p20.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xviii-p21"> <scripRef passage="Philem. i" id="xix.xviii-p21.1" parsed="|Phlm|1|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Phlm.1.1">Philem.
i</scripRef>.</p></note> Great is
the designation of Paul: no title of principality and power, but he
speaks of bonds and chains! Truly great indeed! Although many other
things made him illustrious; his being caught up into the third
heaven, his being transported to Paradise, his hearing unutterable
words; yet he sets down none of these, but mentions the chain
instead of all, for this made him more conspicuous and illustrious
than these. And why so? Because the one were the free gifts of the
Lord’s lovingkindness; and the other the marks of the constancy
and patience of the servant. But it is customary with those who
love, to glory more in the things which they suffer for those who
are beloved, than in the benefits they receive from them. A king is
not so proud of his diadem, as Paul gloried in his chains. And very
justly. For a diadem affords but an ornament to the crowned head;
but the chain is a much greater ornament as well as a security. The
kingly crown often betrays the head it encircles, and allures
innumerable traitors, and invites them to the lust of empire. And
in battles this ornament is so dangerous, that it must be hidden
and laid aside. Hence kings in battle, change the outward dress,
and so mingle in the crowd of combatants; so much betrayal does
there result from the crown; but the chain will bring nothing of
this kind upon those who have it, but altogether the contrary;
since if there be a war, and an engagement with demons, and the
hostile powers; the man who is thus encompassed, by holding forth
his chain, repels their assaults. And many of the secular
magistrates not only bear the name of office while they are in
authority, but when they have given up their authority. Such a one
is called an ex-consul, such a one an ex-prætor. But he, instead
of all such titles, says, “Paul the prisoner.” And very
rightly. For those magisterial offices are no complete evidences of
virtue in respect to the soul; for they are to be purchased by
money, and obtained by the solicitations of friends; but this
distinction that is obtained by bonds is a proof of the soul’s
love of wisdom, and the strongest sign of a longing for Christ. And
the former are soon gone, but this distinction has none to succeed
to it. Behold at least from that time to the present day how long a
time has passed, and yet the name of this Prisoner has become
increasingly illustrious. As to all the consuls, whoever they were,
of former times, they are passed into silence; and not even their
names are known to the generality of mankind. But the name of this
Prisoner, the blessed Paul, is still great here, great in the land
of the barbarians, great also among the Scythians and Indians; and
were you to go even to the very bounds of the habitable world, you
would hear of this appellation, and whithersoever any one could
come, he would perceive that the name of Paul was borne in the
mouths of all men. And what marvel is it, if it be so by land and
sea, when even in the heavens the name of Paul is great; with
angels and archangels and the powers above, and with the King of
these, even God! “But what were the chains,” says some one,
“that brought glory to him who was thus fettered? Were they not
formed of iron?” Of iron, indeed, they were formed; but they
contained the grace of the Spirit, abundantly flourish<pb n="448" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_448.html" id="xix.xviii-Page_448" />ing in them; since he wore them for
Christ’s sake. Oh, wonder! the servants were bound, the Master
was crucified, and yet the preaching of the Gospel every day
increases! And through the means by which it was supposed that it
would be extinguished, by these very means it was kindled; and the
Cross and bonds, which were thought to be an abomination, these are
now become the symbols of salvation; and that iron was to us more
precious than all gold, not by its intrinsic nature, but for this
cause and ground!</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xviii-p22">7. But here I see an enquiry arising out of
this point; and if you give me your attention, I will both state
the question exactly, and will add the solution. What then is the
subject of enquiry? This same Paul once having come before Festus,
whilst discoursing to him, and defending himself concerning the
charges which the Jews had alleged against him, and telling how he
had seen Jesus, how he had heard that blessed voice; how he had
been struck with blindness and recovered sight, and had fallen down
and risen up again; how he had come a captive into Damascus, bound
without chains; after speaking likewise of the Law and of the
Prophets, and shewing that they had foretold all these things, he
captured the judge, and almost persuaded him to come over to
himself. For such are the souls of holy men: when they have fallen
into dangers, they do not consider how they may be delivered from
dangers, but strive every way how they may capture their
persecutors. Just so did it then happen. He came in to defend
himself, and he departed taking the judge with him!<note place="end" n="1663" id="xix.xviii-p22.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xviii-p23"> <i>i.e</i>., in conviction, though not in

<p class="c10" id="xix.xviii-p26">8. But as I was saying:—When Paul had caught

God that thou mightest become a Christian ‘without’ these
bonds!” Yet surely if the bonds were good, and so good, that they
could be the means of making others to grow bold in the cause of
true religion; (for this very thing thou didst declare before, when
thou saidst, “Many of the brethren, waxing confident by my bonds,
did speak the word without fear”); for what reason dost thou not
glory in this thing in the presence of the judge, but doest even
the reverse?</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xviii-p33">9. Does not what I say appear a question? The
solution of it, however, I will bring forward at once. For Paul
acted thus, not from distress or fear, but from an abundance of
wisdom and spiritual understanding. And how this was, I proceed to
explain. He was addressing a Gentile, and an unbeliever, who knew
nothing of our matters. Hence he was unwilling to introduce him by
way of disagreeable things, but as he said, “I became to them
that are without law, as without law;”<note place="end" n="1672" id="xix.xviii-p33.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xviii-p34"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. ix. 21" id="xix.xviii-p34.1" parsed="|1Cor|9|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.9.21">1 Cor.

instance. His meaning is, “If the Gentile hear of bonds and
tribulations, he will straightway be taking flight; since he knows
not the power of bonds. First, let him become a believer; let him
taste of the word preached, and then he will even of himself hasten
towards these bonds. I have heard the Lord saying, “No man
putteth a piece of new cloth into an old garment, for that which is
put in to fill it up taketh from the garment, and the rent is made
worse. Neither do men put new wine into old wine-skins; else the
wine-skins 
<pb n="449" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_449.html" id="xix.xviii-Page_449" />burst.”<note place="end" n="1673" id="xix.xviii-p34.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xviii-p35"> <scripRef passage="Matt. ix. 16, 17; Mark ii. 21; Luke v. 36" id="xix.xviii-p35.1" parsed="|Matt|9|16|9|17;|Mark|2|21|0|0;|Luke|5|36|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.9.16-Matt.9.17 Bible:Mark.2.21 Bible:Luke.5.36">Matt. ix.

garment: an old wine-skin. It is not renewed by the faith, nor
renovated by the grace of the Spirit. It is yet weak and earthly.
It affects the things of this life. It flutters eagerly after
worldly show. It loves a glory that is present. Should he hear at
once, even from the first, that if he becomes a Christian he will
become immediately a prisoner, and will be encompassed with a
chain; feeling ashamed and indignant, he will recoil from the word
preached. Therefore, saith he, “Except these bonds.”<note place="end" n="1674" id="xix.xviii-p35.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xviii-p36"> <scripRef passage="Acts xxvi. 28" id="xix.xviii-p36.1" parsed="|Acts|26|28|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.26.28">Acts

deprecating the bonds themselves, God forbid! But condescending to
the other’s infirmity; for he himself loved and welcomed his
bonds, even as a woman fond of ornament doth her jewels of gold.
Whence is this apparent? “I rejoice,” saith he, “in my

glories in this, and calls it a gift of grace, it is manifest that
when he was addressing the judge, he spoke to him as he did, for
the reason assigned. Moreover, also in a different passage, when he
happened to find a necessity for glorying, he shews the very same
by saying, “Most gladly, therefore, will I glory in my
infirmities……in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in
distresses, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.”<note place="end" n="1678" id="xix.xviii-p39.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xviii-p40"> <scripRef passage="2 Cor. xii. 9, 10" id="xix.xviii-p40.1" parsed="|2Cor|12|9|12|10" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.12.9-2Cor.12.10">2 Cor.

with others, and exhibiting to us his superiority in the
comparison, he thus speaks; “Are they ministers of Christ? (I
speak as a fool), I am more.”<note place="end" n="1680" id="xix.xviii-p41.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xviii-p42"> <scripRef passage="2 Cor. xi. 23" id="xix.xviii-p42.1" parsed="|2Cor|11|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.11.23">2 Cor.
xi. 23</scripRef>.</p></note> And wishing to shew this
superiority, he did not say that he had raised the dead, nor that
he had expelled demons, nor that he had cleansed lepers, nor that
he had done any other thing of the sort, but that he had suffered
those innumerable hardships. Hence when he said,” I am more,”
he presently cites the multitude of his trials; “In stripes,
above measure, in deaths oft, in prisons more frequent…..of the
Jews five times received I forty stripes save one, once was I
stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been
in the deep;”<note place="end" n="1681" id="xix.xviii-p42.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xviii-p43"> <scripRef passage="2 Cor. xi. 23, 25" id="xix.xviii-p43.1" parsed="|2Cor|11|23|0|0;|2Cor|11|25|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.11.23 Bible:2Cor.11.25">2 Cor.
xi. 23, 25</scripRef>.</p></note> and all
the rest. Thus Paul everywhere glories in tribulations; and prides
himself upon this circumstance exceedingly. And very justly. For
this it is which especially shews the power of Christ, viz. that
the Apostles conquered by such means; by bonds, by tribulations, by
scourgings, and the worst of ills.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xviii-p44">10. For these two things Christ had announced,
tribulation and remission, labours and crowns, toils and rewards,
things pleasant and sad. Nevertheless, to the present life he
assigns the sorrowful things; but for the life to come, he has
stored up those which are pleasant; at once shewing that He did not
mean to deceive men, and wishing by this arrangement to diminish
the burden of human woes. For the imposter first holds out the
things which are pleasant, and afterwards brings forward those
which are disagreeable. Thus for example:—Kidnappers, when they
intend to steal and carry off little children, do not promise them
blows and stripes, or any other thing of that kind, but offer them
cakes, and sweetmeats, and such like, by which the age of childhood
is usually gratified; in order that, enticed by these things, they
may sell their liberty, and may fall into the utmost peril.
Moreover, bird-catchers, and fishermen, thus entice the prey which
they pursue, offering first their usual food, and such as is
agreeable to them, and by this means concealing the snare. So that
this is especially the work of imposters, first to hold out things
which are agreeable, but afterwards to introduce the things which
are disagreeable. But the case is altogether the reverse with those
who are really careful and provident for others. Fathers at least
act quite in a contrary manner to kidnappers. When they send their
children to school, they set masters over them, threaten them with
stripes, and encompass them with fear on all sides. But when they
have thus spent the first portion of their lives, and their habits
are formed, they then put them in possession of honour, and power,
and luxury, and all the wealth that is theirs.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xviii-p45">11. And thus God has acted. After the manner of
provident fathers, and not after that of kidnappers, He has first
involved us in things that are grievous; handing us over to present
tribulation, as it were to schoolmasters and teachers; in order
that being chastened and sobered by these things, after shewing
forth all patience, and learning all right discipline, we may
afterwards, when formed into due habits, inherit the kingdom of
heaven. He first prepares and fits us for the management of the
wealth He is to give, and then puts us into the actual possession
of riches. For if He had not acted thus, the giving of riches would
have been no boon, <pb n="450" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_450.html" id="xix.xviii-Page_450" />but a
punishment and a vengeance. For even as a son that is senseless and
prodigal, when he has succeeded to a paternal inheritance, is
precipitated headlong by this very thing, having none of the
practical wisdom requisite for the economy of wealth; but if he be
intelligent, and gentle, and sober, and moderate, managing his
paternal estate as is befitting, he becomes by this means more
illustrious and distinguished: so must it also necessarily happen
in our case. When we have acquired spiritual understanding, when we
have all attained to “perfect manhood,” and the measure of full
stature;” then He puts us in possession of all that He has
promised: but now as little children He chastens us, together with
consolation and soothing. And this is not the only advantage of
receiving the tribulation beforehand, but there is also another,
not less than this. For the man who first of all lives luxuriously,
and then has to expect punishment after his luxurious living, has
not even a sense of his present luxury, merely by reason of the
expectation of impending woes; but he who is first in a sorrowful
state, if he is anticipating the enjoyment of good things
afterwards, overlooks present difficulties, in the hope of the good
things which are to come. Not only, then, on account of our
security, but also for our pleasure and consolation hath He
ordained that the things which are grievous should be first; in
order that being lightened with the hope of futurity, we should be
rendered insensible to what is present. And this Paul would shew
and make plain, when he said, “Our light affliction, which is but
for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal
weight of glory. While we look not at the things which are seen,
but at the things which are not seen.”<note place="end" n="1682" id="xix.xviii-p45.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xviii-p46"> <scripRef passage="2 Cor. iv. 17, 18" id="xix.xviii-p46.1" parsed="|2Cor|4|17|4|18" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.4.17-2Cor.4.18">2 Cor.
iv. 17, 18</scripRef>.</p></note> He calls tribulation light, not
because of the intrinsic nature of things that are grievous, but
because of the expectation of good things to come. For even as the
merchant is indifferent to the labour that attends navigation,
being buoyed up with the hope of a cargo; and as the boxer bravely
sustains the blows on his head, looking to the crown beyond; so
also indeed do we, earnestly gazing towards heaven, and the good
things that are in the heavens, whatever evils come on us, sustain
them all with fortitude, being nerved with the good hope of the
things to come.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xviii-p47">12. Therefore let us go home, taking with us
this saying;<note place="end" n="1683" id="xix.xviii-p47.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xviii-p48"> <i>i.e</i>., Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ.</p></note> for though
it be simple and short, it nevertheless contains much of the
doctrine of spiritual wisdom. He who is in a state of grief and
tribulation, hath a sufficient consolation; he who lives in luxury
and abundance, hath that which may greatly sober him. For when as
thou sittest at the table thou art reminded of this saying, thou
wilt speedily shrink from drunkenness and gluttony; learning
through this sentence, how needful it is for us to be striving; and
thou wilt say with thyself, “Paul lived in bonds and in dungeons,
but I in drunkenness and at a luxurious table! What pardon then
shall I obtain?” This also is a fit saying for women; since those
who are fond of ornament, and expensive dresses, and bind
themselves about with gold on every side, when they remember this
chain, will hate, I feel assured, and abominate that adorning of
themselves; and will hasten to such bonds as these. For those
ornaments have often been the cause of manifold evils, and
introduced a thousand quarrels into a family, and have bred envy,
and jealousy, and hatred. But these loosed the sins of the wide
world, affrighted demons, and drove away the devil. With these,
while tarrying in prison, he persuaded the jailor; with these he
attracted Agrippa himself; with these he procured many disciples.
Therefore he said, “Wherein I suffer trouble as an evil-doer unto
bonds, but the word of God is not bound.”<note place="end" n="1684" id="xix.xviii-p48.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xviii-p49"> <scripRef passage="2 Tim. ii. 9" id="xix.xviii-p49.1" parsed="|2Tim|2|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Tim.2.9">2 Tim.

bind a sunbeam, or to shut it up within the house, so neither the
preaching of the word; and what was much more, the teacher was
bound, and yet the word flew abroad; he inhabited the prison, and
yet his doctrine rapidly winged its way every where throughout the
world!</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xviii-p50">Knowing these things then, let us not be

but this we should not consider; for going through the fast does
not consist in merely going through the time, but in going through
it with amendment of manners. Let us consider this; whether we have
become more diligent; whether we have corrected any of our defects;
whether we have washed away our sins? It is common for every one to
ask in Lent, how many weeks each has fasted; and some may be heard
saying that they have fasted two, others three, and others that
they have fasted the whole of the weeks. But what advantage is it,
if we have gone through <pb n="451" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_451.html" id="xix.xviii-Page_451" />the
fast devoid of good works? If another says, “I have fasted the
whole of Lent,” do thou say, “I had an enemy, but I was
reconciled; I had a custom of evil-speaking, but I put a stop to
it; I had a custom of swearing, but I have broken through this evil
practice.” It is of no advantage to merchants, to have gone over
a great extent of ocean, but to have sailed with a freight and much
merchandise. The fast will profit us nothing, if we pass through it
as a mere matter of course, without any result. If we practise a
mere abstinence from meats, when the forty days are past, the fast
is over too. But if we abstain from sins, this still remains, even
when the fast has gone by, and will be from this time a continual
advantage to us; and will here render us no small recompense,
before we attain unto the kingdom of heaven. For as he who is
living in iniquity, even before hell, hath punishment, being stung
by his conscience; so the man who is rich in good works, even
before the kingdom, will have the benefit of exceeding joy, in that
he is nourished with blessed hopes.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xviii-p53">14. Therefore Christ says, “I will see you
again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh
from you.”<note place="end" n="1686" id="xix.xviii-p53.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xviii-p54"> <scripRef passage="John xvi. 22" id="xix.xviii-p54.1" parsed="|John|16|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.16.22">John xvi.

saying, but one that hath in it much consolation. What then is
this, “your joy no man taketh?” if thou hast money, many are
able to take away the joy that comes of thy wealth; as, for
instance, a thief, by digging through the wall; a servant by
carrying off what was entrusted to him; an emperor by confiscation;
and the envious man by contumely. Should you possess power, there
are many who are able to deprive you of the joy of it. For when the
conditions of office are at an end, the conditions of pleasure will
also be ended. And in the exercise of office itself too, there are
many accidents occurring, which by bringing difficulty and care,
strike at the root of thy satisfaction. If thou hast bodily
strength, the assaults of disease put a stop to joy from that
source. If thou hast beauty and bloom, the approach of old age
withers it, and takes away that joy. Or if thou enjoyest a
sumptuous table, when evening comes on the joy of the banquet is at
an end; for every thing belonging to this life is liable to damage,
and is unable to afford us a lasting pleasure; but piety and the
virtue of the soul is altogether the reverse of this. If thou hast
done an alms, no one is able to take away this good work. Though an
army, or kings, or myriads of calumniators and conspirators, were
to beset thee on all sides, they could not take away the
possession, once deposited in heaven; but the joy thereof
continually abideth; for it is said, “He hath dispersed, he hath
given to the poor, his righteousness endureth for ever.”<note place="end" n="1687" id="xix.xviii-p54.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xviii-p55"> <scripRef passage="Ps. cxii. 9" id="xix.xviii-p55.1" parsed="|Ps|12|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.12.9">Ps. cxii.

justly; for in the storehouses of heaven it is laid up, where no
thief breaks in, nor robber seizes, nor moth devours.<note place="end" n="1688" id="xix.xviii-p55.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xviii-p56"> <scripRef passage="Matt. vi. 19; Luke xii. 33" id="xix.xviii-p56.1" parsed="|Matt|6|19|0|0;|Luke|12|33|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.6.19 Bible:Luke.12.33">Matt. vi.
19; Luke xii. 33</scripRef>.</p></note> If thou
pourest out continued and fervent prayers, no man will be able to
spoil thee of the fruit of them; for this fruit too is rooted in
the heavens; it is out of the way of all injury, and remains beyond
mortal reach. If when evil-treated thou has done a kind action; if
thou hast borne with patience to hear thyself evil spoken of; if
thou hast returned blessings for reproaches; these are good works
that abide continually, and the joy of them no man taketh away; but
as often as thou rememberest these, thou art glad and rejoicest,
and reapest large fruits of pleasure. So also, indeed, if we
succeed in avoiding oaths; and persuade our tongue to abstain from
this pernicious practice, the good work will be finished in a short
time, but the delight arising from it will be continuous and
unfailing.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xviii-p57">15. And now, it is time that you should be
teachers and guides of others; that friends should undertake to
instruct and lead on their neighbours; servants their
fellow-servants; and youths those of their own age. What if any one
had promised thee a single piece of gold for every man who was
reformed, wouldest thou not then have used every exertion, and been
all day long sitting by them, persuading and exhorting. Yet now God
promises thee not one piece of gold, nor ten, or twenty, or a
hundred, or a thousand; no, nor the whole earth, for thy labours,
but He gives thee that which is greater than all the world, the
kingdom of heaven; and not only this, but also another thing
besides it. And what kind of thing is that? “He who taketh forth
the precious from the vile,”<note place="end" n="1689" id="xix.xviii-p57.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xviii-p58"> <i>i.e</i>, the soul of a man from the vile state
of sin.</p></note> saith He, “shall be as my
mouth.”<note place="end" n="1690" id="xix.xviii-p58.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xviii-p59"> <scripRef passage="Jer. xv. 19" id="xix.xviii-p59.1" parsed="|Jer|15|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Jer.15.19">Jer. xv.

be equal to this in point of honour or security? What kind of
excuse or pardon can be left to those, who after so great a promise
neglect their neighbour’s safety? Now if you see a blind man
falling into a pit, you stretch forth a hand, and think it a
disgraceful thing to overlook one who is about to perish? But daily
beholding all thy brethren precipitated into the wicked custom of
oaths, dost thou not dare even to utter a word? Thou hast spoken
once, perhaps, and he hath not heard. Speak there<pb n="452" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_452.html" id="xix.xviii-Page_452" />fore twice, and thrice, and as often
as it may be, till thou hast persuaded him. Every day God is
addressing us, and we do not hear; and yet He does not leave off
speaking. Do thou, therefore, imitate this tender care towards thy
neighbour. For this reason it is that we are placed with one
another; that we inhabit cities, and that we meet together in
churches, in order that we may bear one another’s burdens, that
we may correct one another’s sins. And in the same manner as
persons inhabiting the same shop, carry on a separate traffic, yet
put all afterwards into the common fund, so also let us act.
Whatever advantages each man is able to confer upon his neighbour,
let him not grudge, nor shrink from doing it, but let there be some
such kind of spiritual commerce, and reciprocity; in order that
having deposited every thing in the common store, and obtained
great riches, and procured a large treasure, we may be all together
partakers of the kingdom of heaven; through the grace and
loving-kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, by Whom and with Whom, to
the Father, with the Holy Ghost, be glory, both now and ever, and
world without end. Amen.</p>

Let us give thanks then, not only that God hath calmed the tempest,
but that He suffered it to take place; not only that He rescued us
from shipwreck, but that He allowed us to fall into such distress;
and such an extreme peril to hang over us. Thus also Paul bids us

thankful to Him for this deliverance from trials; and let us never
forget them. Let us devote ourselves to prayer, to continual
supplications, and to much piety.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xix-p9">2. When the sad conflagration of these
calamities was first kindled, I said, that it was a season not for
doctrine, but for prayer.<note place="end" n="1696" id="xix.xix-p9.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xix-p10"> Hom. II. 1.</p></note> The very same thing I now repeat,
when the fire has been extinguished—that it is now especially,
and more than before, a time for prayer; that now is the season
especially for tears and compunction, for an anxious soul, for much
diligence, and for much caution. For at that time the very nature
of our tribulation restrained us, however unwillingly, and disposed
us to sobriety; and led us to become more religious; but now when
the bridle is removed, and the cloud has passed away, there is fear
lest we should fall back again into sloth, or become relaxed by
this respite; and lest one should have reason to say of us too,
“When He slew them, then they sought Him, and returned, and
enquired early after God.”<note place="end" n="1697" id="xix.xix-p10.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xix-p11"> <scripRef passage="Ps. lxxviii. 34" id="xix.xix-p11.1" parsed="|Ps|78|34|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.78.34">Ps.

will now be rendered manifest, if you continue in the practice of
the same piety. For at that time, many imputed your earnestness to
fear, and the approach of calamity; but now, it will be purely your
own achievement, if you still persevere in maintaining this
earnestness. Since with a boy too, as long as he is guided
<pb n="453" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_453.html" id="xix.xix-Page_453" />by some tutor whom he fears, if
he lives with sobriety and meekness, there is nothing to admire,
for all persons ascribe the sobriety of the stripling to his fear
of the tutor. But when he remains in the same seemly behaviour,
after the restraint from that quarter is done away with, all
persons give him credit too for the sobriety that was seen in his
earlier age. Thus also let us act; let us continue in the same
state of godly fear, in order that for our former diligence too we
may gain much praise from God.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xix-p13">3. We had expected innumerable woes; that our
property would be plundered, that the houses would have been burnt
together with their inmates, that the city would have been plucked
up from the midst of the world, that its very fragments would have
been utterly destroyed, and that its soil would have been placed
under the plough! But, lo! all these things existed only in
expectation, and did not come into operation. And this is not the
only wonder, that God hath removed so great a danger, but that He
hath also greatly blessed us, and adorned our city; and by this
trial and calamity hath made us more approved! But how, I will
state. When those who were sent by the Emperor erected that fearful
tribunal for making inquisition into the events which had taken
place, and summoned every one to give account of the deeds which
they had perpetrated, and various anticipations of death pervaded
the minds of all, then the monks who dwelt on the mountain-tops
shewed their own true philosophy. For although they had been shut
up so many years in their cells, yet at no one’s entreaty, by no
one’s counsel, when they beheld such a cloud overhanging the
city, they left their caves and huts, and flocked together in every
direction, as if they had been so many angels arriving from heaven.
Then might one see the city likened to heaven, while these saints
appeared everywhere; by their mere aspect consoling the mourners,
and leading them to an utter disregard of the calamity. For who on
beholding these would not deride death, would not despise life. And
not only was this wonderful, but that when they drew nigh to the
magistrates themselves, they spoke to them with boldness on behalf
of the accused, and were all ready to shed their blood, and to lay
down their heads, so that they might snatch the captured from the
terrible events which they expected. They also declared that they
would not depart until the judges should spare the population of
the city, or send them themselves together with the accused to the
Emperor. “He,” said they, “who rules over our portion of the
world is a godly man, a believer, one who lives in the practice of
piety. We therefore shall assuredly reconcile him. We will not give
you leave, nor permit you to embrue the sword, or take off a head.
But if ye do not desist, we also are quite resolved to die with
them. We confess that the crimes committed are very heinous; but
the iniquity of those deeds does not surpass the humanity of the
Emperor.” One of them is also reported to have uttered another
saying, full of wisdom, to this effect:<note place="end" n="1699" id="xix.xix-p13.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xix-p14"> The name of this monk was Macedonius (see
Theodoret <i>Hist. Relig</i>. No. xiii. where it is added that he
spoke through an interpreter).</p></note> “The Statues which have been
thrown down are again set up, and have resumed their proper
appearance; and the mischief was speedily rectified; but if ye put
to death the image of God, how will ye be again able to revoke the
deed! or how to reanimate those who are deprived of life, and to
restore their souls to their bodies?” Many things too they said
to them of the Judgment.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xix-p15">4. Who could but be astonished? Who could but
admire the moral wisdom of these men? When the mother of one of the
accused, uncovering her head, and exposing her grey hairs, laid
hold of the horse of the judge by the bridle, and running beside
him through the forum, thus entered with him the place of justice,
we were all struck with astonishment, we all admired that exceeding
tenderness and magnanimity.<note place="end" n="1700" id="xix.xix-p15.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xix-p16"> See Lib. ad Helleb.</p></note> Ought we not, then, to have been
much more impressed with wonder at the conduct of these men? For if
she had even died for her son, it would have been nothing strange,
since great is the tyranny of nature, and irresistible is the
obligation arising from the maternal pangs! But these men so loved
those whom they had not begotten, whom they had not brought up, yea
rather, whom they had never seen, whom they had not heard of, whom
they had never met, whom they knew only from their calamity, that
if they had possessed a thousand lives, they would have chosen to
deliver them all up for their safety. Tell me not that they were
not slaughtered, that they did not pour forth their blood, but that
they used as much boldness with their judges as it was likely that
no other men would do, but such as had already renounced their own
lives; and that with this sentiment they ran from the mountains to
the tribunal. For, indeed, if they had not before prepared
themselves against every sort of slaughter, they would not have
been able to speak thus freely to the judges, or to have manifested
such magnanimity. For they remained all day long sitting
before <pb n="454" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_454.html" id="xix.xix-Page_454" />the doors of the
place of justice, being prepared to snatch from the hands of the
executioners those who were about to be led off to punishment!</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xix-p17">5. Where now are those who are clad in
threadbare cloaks, and display a long beard, and carry staves in
the right hand; the philosophers of the world,<note place="end" n="1701" id="xix.xix-p17.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xix-p18"> τῶν žξωθεν. “Of those
without;” a common phrase with St. Chrysostom to denote those
without the pale of the Church.</p></note> who are more abject in disposition
than the dogs under the table; and do every thing for the sake of
the belly? All these men then forsook the city, they all hasted
away, and hid themselves in caves! But they only, who truly by
works manifest the love of wisdom, appeared as fearlessly in the
forum, as if no evil had overtaken the city. And the inhabitants of
the city fled away to the mountains and to the deserts, but the
citizens of the desert hastened into the city; demonstrating by
deeds what, on the preceding days, I have not desisted from saying,
that the very furnace will not be able to harm the man who leads a
virtuous life. Such a thing is philosophy of soul, rising superior
to all things, and to all prosperous or adverse events; for neither
is it enfeebled by the former, nor beaten down and debased by the
latter, but abides on the same level through the whole course of
things, shewing its own native force and power! Who, indeed, was
not convicted of weakness by the difficulty of the present crisis?
Those who had held the first offices in our city, who were in
places of power, who were surrounded with immense wealth, and who
were in high favour with the Emperor, leaving their houses utterly
deserted, all consulted their own safety, and all friendship and
kindred were found worthless, and those whom they formerly knew, at
this season of calamity, they desired not to know, and prayed to be
unknown of them! But the monks, poor as they were, having nothing
more than a mean garment, who had lived in the coarsest manner, who
seemed formerly to be nobodies, men habituated to mountains and
forests; as if they had been so many lions, with a great and lofty
soul, whilst all were fearing and quaking, stood forth and relieved
the danger, and that, not in the course of many days, but in a
brief moment of time! And as distinguished warriors without coming
into close conflict with their adversaries, but merely by making
their appearance in the ranks, and shouting, put the foe to rout,
so also these in one day descended, and said their say, and removed
the calamity, and returned to their own tabernacles. So great is
the moral wisdom that was brought among men by Christ.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xix-p19">6. And why do I speak of the rich, and of
those in authority? When those very persons who had been invested
with power to judge the criminals; who acted with the highest
authority, were entreated by these selfsame monks to grant a
sentence of pardon, they said, they had no power over the result;
for that it was unsafe and dangerous, not only to insult the
Emperor, but even to dismiss those who had insulted him, when
taken, without punishment. But these men were too powerful for any
one to resist; and besieging them by magnanimity and perseverance,
they induced these officers by their importunity to exercise a
power which they had not received from the Emperor; and even
succeeded in persuading the judges, when men had been manifestly
convicted of the guilt, not to declare the sentence of
condemnation, but to defer the final result to the decision of the
Emperor; and they promised certainly to persuade him to grant a
pardon to those who had transgressed against him; and they were
about to set out on a journey to him. But the judges, reverencing
the moral wisdom of these men, and being struck with their
loftiness of spirit, did not permit them to undertake this long
journey, but promised that if they should only receive their words
in writing, they would themselves depart and successfully
importune<note place="end" n="1702" id="xix.xix-p19.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xix-p20"> δυσωπήσειν: same word as
is rendered above “induced by importunity.” Literally, “to
put out of countenance;” to make another ashamed not to grant a
request.</p></note> the
Emperor to dismiss all anger (which, indeed, we are now expecting
that he will). For when sentence should have been given, they, on
being admitted into court, uttered words of the highest wisdom, and
besought the Emperor by letters to shew mercy; and they reminded
him of the Judgment, and said that they would lay down their own
heads, if his mercy was not granted. And the judges took down these
words in writing, and departed. This, more than the brightest
crown, will adorn our city. And what has here taken place, the
Emperor will now hear; yea, the great City will hear, and the whole
world will hear, that the monks who dwell at the city of Antioch,
are men who have displayed an apostolic boldness; and now when
their letters are read at court, all men will admire their
magnanimity; all men will call our city blessed; and we shall shake
off our evil reputation; and it will be known every where, that
what has happened was not the work of the inhabitants of the city,
but of strangers and corrupt-minded men; and that this testimony of
the monks will be a sufficient evidence of the character of the
city.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xix-p21"><pb n="455" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_455.html" id="xix.xix-Page_455" />7. Therefore,
beloved, let us not be distressed, but let us entertain favourable
hopes; for if their boldness toward men has been able to prevent
such a danger, then what will not their boldness toward God effect?
These things also let us tell the Greeks, when they dare to dispute
with us respecting their philosophers! From hence it is manifest
that their stories of former days are false, but that the things of
old reported among us are true; that is, the things concerning
John, and Paul, and Peter, and all the rest. For inasmuch as these
monks have succeeded to the piety of those men, they have
consequently exhibited their boldness. Inasmuch as they were
brought up in the same laws, they have consequently imitated their
virtues. So that we stand in no need of writings for the purpose of
shewing the apostolical virtues, whilst the very facts cry aloud,
and the masters are shewn forth by the scholars. We have no need of
disputation to display the trifling of the Greeks, and the
little-mindedness of their philosophers, whilst their deeds now
loudly proclaim, as they did aforetime, that all with them is a
fable, a stage-play, a piece of acting.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xix-p22">8. And the same magnanimity was displayed by
the priests too, as well as the monks, and they shared among them
the charge of our safety. One<note place="end" n="1703" id="xix.xix-p22.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xix-p23"> The bishop, spoken of in the opening of Hom. III.
and in Hom. XXI.</p></note> of them, indeed, proceeded to
court, esteeming all things as secondary to the love of you; and
being himself ready, if he could not persuade the Emperor, to lay
down his own life. And these, who remained here, have displayed the
same virtues as the monks themselves; and holding fast the judges
with their own hands, they would not let them enter into the court,
before they gave a promise respecting the result of the trial. And
when they saw them making signs of refusal, they again exerted
themselves with much boldness; and as soon as they saw that they
did consent, embracing their feet and knees, and kissing their
hands, they gave an exceeding proof of either virtue, of liberty
and meekness. For that theirs was not the boldness of presumption,
they plainly signified by their kissing the knees, and embracing
the feet of the judges. Again, in proof that this was not flattery,
nor a kind of fawning servility, nor the fruit of a slavish spirit,
their former acts attested their boldness. And these are not the
only good results we have reaped from the trial, but also an
abundance of sobriety and meekness; and our city has become all at
once a monastery.<note place="end" n="1704" id="xix.xix-p23.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xix-p24"> The state of monasteries at that time may be
gathered from Theodoret’s <i>Historia Religiosa</i>; the
Collations of Cassian; the ascetic works, and parts of the
correspondence of St. Basil; the <i>Historia Lausiaca</i> of
Palladius, and many parts of St. Macarius.</p></note> Not thus would any one have
adorned it, had he erected golden statues in the forum, as it has
now been adorned and distinguished, in producing those beautiful
images of virtue, and displaying its true riches!</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xix-p25">9. But it may be that the things which the
Emperor hath decreed are painful. No! not even these are really
burdensome, but have brought much advantage with them. For what is
there, I ask, which is oppressive in any of them? that the Emperor
hath shut up the Orchestra, that he hath forbidden the Hippodrome,
that he hath closed and stopped up these fountains of iniquity. May
they never again be opened! From thence did the roots of wickedness
shoot forth to the injury of the city!<note place="end" n="1705" id="xix.xix-p25.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xix-p26"> Such was the case, too, with the tumults at
Alexandria. See Libanius, <i>Or. de Sed</i>.</p></note> From thence sprung those who blast
its character; men who sell their voices<note place="end" n="1706" id="xix.xix-p26.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xix-p27"> <i>i.e</i>., their applause.</p></note> to the dancers, and who for the
sake of three obols prostitute their salvation to them, turning all
things upside down! Art thou distressed, O beloved! for these
things? Truly it were fitting that for these thou shouldest be
glad, and rejoice, and express thy thanks to the Emperor, since his
castigation hath proved a correction, his punishment a discipline,
his wrath a means of instruction! But that the Baths are shut up?
Neither is this an intolerable hardship, that those who lead a
soft, effeminate, and dissolute life, should be brought back,
though unwillingly, to the love of true wisdom.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xix-p28">10. But is it complained of, that the Emperor
hath taken away the dignity of the city, and hath no more permitted
it to be called a metropolis?<note place="end" n="1707" id="xix.xix-p28.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xix-p29"> It appears that the metropolitan dignity of
Antioch was transferred to Laodicea.</p></note> But what was he to do? Could he
praise what had been done, and acknowledge it as a favour? Then who
would not have blamed him, for not shewing even the outward form of
indignation? Seest thou not that fathers do many things of a
similar nature towards their children? They turn away from them,
and forbid them the table. This also hath the Emperor done by
imposing such punishments as have nothing in them hurtful, but
carry with them much correction. Think what we expected, and what
has taken place, and then we shall especially discern the favour of
God! Dost thou grieve that the dignity of the city is taken away?
Learn what the dignity of a city is; and then thou wilt know
clearly, that if the inhabitants do not betray it, no one else will
be able to take away the dignity of a city! Not the fact that it is
a metropolis; nor that it contains large and beautiful buildings;<note place="end" n="1708" id="xix.xix-p29.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xix-p30"> For such topics of praise, see the Antiochicus of
Libanius, who however also extols the virtue of the citizens.</p></note> nor
that <pb n="456" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_456.html" id="xix.xix-Page_456" />it has many
columns, and spacious porticoes and walks, nor that it is named in
proclamations before other cities, but the virtue and piety of its
inhabitants; this is a city’s dignity, and ornament, and defence;
since if these things are not found in it, it is the most
insignificant in the world, though it may enjoy unlimited honour
from Emperors! Dost thou wish to learn the dignity of thy city?
Dost thou wish to know its ancestry? I will tell it exactly; not
only that thou mayest know, but that thou mayest also emulate. What
then is after all the dignity of this city of ours? “It came to
pass, that the disciples were first called Christians at
Antioch.”<note place="end" n="1709" id="xix.xix-p30.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xix-p31"> <scripRef passage="Acts xi. 26" id="xix.xix-p31.1" parsed="|Acts|11|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.11.26">Acts xi.

dignity, none of the cities throughout the world possesses, not
even the city of Romulus herself! For this it can look the whole
world in the face; on account of that love toward Christ, that
boldness and virtue.<note place="end" n="1710" id="xix.xix-p31.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xix-p32"> These expressions imply that the name Christian
was fastened on the disciples of Jesus by way of derision and
reproach.</p></note> Dost thou wish farther to hear of
a different dignity and commendation belonging to this city? A
grievous famine was once approaching, and the inhabitants of
Antioch determined, as far as each person had the means, to send
relief to the Saints dwelling at Jerusalem.<note place="end" n="1711" id="xix.xix-p32.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xix-p33"> <scripRef passage="Acts xi. 28, 29" id="xix.xix-p33.1" parsed="|Acts|11|28|11|29" osisRef="Bible:Acts.11.28-Acts.11.29">Acts xi.
28, 29</scripRef>.</p></note> Behold a second dignity, charity
in a time of famine! The season did not make them niggardly, nor
the expectation of the calamity backward in helping; but when all
are apt to be scraping up what is not their own, then they
distributed their own, not merely to those who were near, but also
to those who were living afar off! Seest thou here the faith
towards God, and the love towards their neighbour? Wouldest thou
learn another dignity of this city? Certain men came down from
Judæa to Antioch, defiling<note place="end" n="1712" id="xix.xix-p33.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xix-p34"> Making turbid, <i>i.e</i>., by

introducing Jewish observances.<note place="end" n="1713" id="xix.xix-p34.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xix-p35"> See <scripRef passage="Acts xv. 1" id="xix.xix-p35.1" parsed="|Acts|15|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.15.1">Acts
xv. 1</scripRef>.</p></note> The men of Antioch did not bear
this novelty in silence. They did not hold their peace, but having
come together, and made an assembly, they sent Paul and Barnabas to
Jerusalem, and caused the Apostles to provide that pure doctrines,
cleared from all Jewish imperfection, might be distributed
throughout all parts of the world! This is the dignity of the city!
this is its precedence! this makes it a metropolis, not in the
earth, but in heaven; forasmuch as that all other honours are
corruptible, and fleeting, and perish with the present life, and
often come to their end before the close of it, as they have done
in the present instance! To me, a city that hath not pious citizens
is meaner than any village, and more ignoble than any
cave.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xix-p36">11. And why do I speak of a city? For that
thou mayest exactly understand that virtue alone is the ornament of
the inhabitants, I will not speak to thee of a city, but I will
endeavour to demonstrate this by bringing forward what is more
venerable than any city—the Temple of God which was in Jerusalem.
For this was the Temple in which were sacrifices and prayers and
services; where was the Holy of Holies, and the Cherubim, the
Covenant,<note place="end" n="1714" id="xix.xix-p36.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xix-p37"> <i>i.e</i>., the Tables,

symbols of God’s providence towards that people; where oracles
from heaven were constantly being received, where prophets became
inspired, where the fashioning was not the work of human art, but
proceeded from the wisdom of God, where the walls were on every
side resplendent with much gold, and where, in surpassing
excellence, costliness of material and perfection of art met
together, and demonstrated that there was no other temple like this
upon earth! Yea rather, not only the perfection of art, but also
the wisdom of God assisted in that building. For Solomon had
learned all, not intuitively and from himself, but from God;<note place="end" n="1716" id="xix.xix-p38.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xix-p39"> <scripRef passage="1 Kings iv. 29; 2 Chron. iii. 3" id="xix.xix-p39.1" parsed="|1Kgs|4|29|0|0;|2Chr|3|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Kgs.4.29 Bible:2Chr.3.3">1 Kings

received the design of it from the heavens, he then marked it out
and erected it. Nevertheless, this Temple, thus beautiful and
marvellous and sacred, when those who used it were corrupted, was
so dishonoured, despised, and profaned, that even before the
captivity it was called “a den of robbers, a cave of
hyænas;”<note place="end" n="1717" id="xix.xix-p39.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xix-p40"> <scripRef passage="Jer. vii. 11" id="xix.xix-p40.1" parsed="|Jer|7|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Jer.7.11">Jer. vii.

polluted, and profane!</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xix-p41">12. Wouldest thou learn the same truth
respecting cities? What could be more illustrious than the cities
of Sodom? For the houses and the buildings were splendid, and so
were their walls; and the country was fat and fertile, and “like
the Paradise of God.”<note place="end" n="1718" id="xix.xix-p41.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xix-p42"> <scripRef passage="Gen. xiii. 10" id="xix.xix-p42.1" parsed="|Gen|13|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.13.10">Gen.

and small, and had no fortification. Yet when a foreign war took
place, the strangers broke down and took the walled cities, and
departed, carrying away their inhabitants captives. Abraham,
however, the citizen of the desert, they could not resist when he
attacked them! And so it was likely to be. For he had true piety: a
power much greater than numbers and the defence of walls. If thou
art a Christian, no earthly city is thine. Of our City “the
Builder and Maker is God.”<note place="end" n="1719" id="xix.xix-p42.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xix-p43"> <scripRef passage="Heb. xi. 10" id="xix.xix-p43.1" parsed="|Heb|11|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Heb.11.10">Heb. xi.

world, we are withal but strangers and sojourners in it all! We are
enrolled in heaven: our citizenship is there! Let us not, after the
manner of little children, despise things that are great, and
admire those which are little! Not our city’s greatness, but
virtue of soul is our ornament and defence. If you suppose dignity
to belong to a city, think how many persons must partake in this
dignity, who are whoremongers, effeminate, depraved and full of ten
thousand evil things, and at last despise such honour! But that
City above is not of this kind; for it is impossible that he can be
a partaker of it, who has not exhibited every virtue.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xix-p44">13. Let us not therefore be senseless; but
then let us grieve when any one deprives us of our dignity of soul,
when we commit sin, when we have offended the common Lord of all;
since as regards the things that have now befallen us, so far are
they from injuring the city, that if we are watchful, they will
greatly benefit us. For even already our city seems to be like a
decorous, noble, sober-minded matron. Fear hath made her gentler
and more dignified, and hath delivered her from those miscreants
who were concerned in the late audacious deeds. Let us therefore
not give way to womanish lamentations. For I have heard many about
the forum saying, “Alas! for thee, Antioch! What hath befallen
thee! How art thou dishonoured!” Truly when I heard, I smiled at
the puerile mind which could give vent to these words! Such words
were not becoming now; but when thou seest men dancing, drunken,
singing, blaspheming, swearing, perjuring themselves, and lying,
then apply such a saying as this: “Alas! for thee, O city, what
hath befallen thee!” But if thou seest the forum containing a few
meek, modest, and temperate persons, then pronounce the city,
“Blessed!” For the fewness will never be able to injure it in
any respect, if there be virtue withal; as on the other hand,
numbers will never profit it at all, whilst iniquity is there.
“If,” saith the prophet, “the number of the sons of Israel be
as the sand of the sea, the remnant shall be saved;”<note place="end" n="1720" id="xix.xix-p44.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xix-p45"> <scripRef passage="Isa. x. 22; Rom. ix. 27" id="xix.xix-p45.1" parsed="|Isa|10|22|0|0;|Rom|9|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.10.22 Bible:Rom.9.27">Isa. x.

say, “Multitude will never prevail with Me.” So also Christ
spoke. He called cities wretched; not because of their littleness,

multitude bring, if their system of living be vicious? Nay, on the
contrary, even injury results from it. What else, indeed, hath
wrought the evils which have lately sprung up? Was it not the
sloth, the recklessness, and the depravity of the inhabitants? Did
the dignity of the city, did the magnificence of its architecture,
or the circumstance that it was a metropolis, do it any service? If
with the king who is on earth, nothing could protect it when it had
done thus amiss, but all these privileges are taken away; much more
with the Lord of angels will its dignity fail to protect it? For at
that Day, it will nought avail us, that we have dwelt in a
metropolis, that has many spacious porticoes, and other dignities
of this kind! And why do I say, at That Day? For as regards the
present life, what can it benefit thee that this thy city is a
metropolis? Pray, has any one restored a distressed family by means
of this? or received any revenue from this dignity? or dispelled
sadness? or got rid of any bodily infirmity? or put away a vice of
the soul? Beloved! let us not trifle, nor regard the opinions of
the multitude, but understand what is indeed the dignity of a city;
what it is that makes a city truly a metropolis?</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xix-p48">14. I say all this, though I expect that the
city will again regain even this outward distinction, and appear in
its own proper place of precedence. For the Emperor is both
philanthropic and godly. But I am desirous that if it should be
restored, ye may not think too much of this; nor be boastful of it;
nor place the honour of our city to that account. When you wish to
pronounce an encomium on the city, tell me not of the suburb of
Daphne,<note place="end" n="1723" id="xix.xix-p48.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xix-p49"> See Hom. I. contr. Jud. (6). The same is to be
said of the Synagogue. For though there be no idol there, yet
devils inhabit the place. Which I say not only of the Synagogue
that is here, but also of that in Daphne, where is that more
abominable pit which they call Matrona’s, &amp;c. See also <scripRef passage="2 Macc. 4.33" id="xix.xix-p49.1" parsed="|2Macc|4|33|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Macc.4.33">Macc. iv.

Introduction to the Homily on St. Babylas in this volume.</p></note> nor of the
height and multitude of its cypresses, nor of its fountains of
waters, nor of the great population who inhabit the city, nor of
the great freedom with which its market-place is frequented even to
midnight, nor of the abundance of its wares! All these are things
of the outward sense, and remain only as long as the present life.
But if you are able to mention virtue, meekness, alms-giving,
nocturnal vigils, prayers, sobriety, true wisdom of soul; commend
the city for these things! To those who inhabit the desert, the
presence of these things makes it 
<pb n="458" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_458.html" id="xix.xix-Page_458" />more illustrious than any city; and again
the vilest of all places,<note place="end" n="1724" id="xix.xix-p49.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xix-p50"> Ben. καὶ π€λιν π€ντων

“and a city the vilest.” The former seems favoured by ἐκείνης following,
and would be the more forcible, supposing the audience duly

with its citizens. Let us make this estimate not in the case of
cities only, but also of men. And if you see a big man, who has
been brought into good condition, tall, and surpassing others in
length of limb, do not admire him, until you have ascertained what
the man’s soul is. Not from the outward comeliness, but from the
beauty that. appertains to the soul, should we pronounce any
persons blessed! David was little, and short of stature;
nevertheless, one so short and little, and bare of all arms,
brought down at one blow so large an army, and that tower of flesh;
and this without hurling spear, or letting fly arrow, or
unsheathing sword, but doing all with a small pebble! For this
reason a certain one exhorts, saying, “Commend not a man for his
beauty, neither abhor a man for his outward appearance. The bee is
little among such as fly, but her fruit is the chief of sweet
things.”<note place="end" n="1725" id="xix.xix-p50.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xix-p51"> <scripRef passage="Ecclesiasticus 11.2,3" id="xix.xix-p51.1" parsed="|Sir|11|2|11|3" osisRef="Bible:Sir.11.2-Sir.11.3">Ecclus. xi. 2, 3</scripRef>.</p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xix-p52">15. Thus also let us speak both of a city, and
of men, and utter such wisdom one to another, and be continually
thankful to God, as well for present as for past mercies; and call
upon Him in common with all our might, that those who now dwell in
prison<note place="end" n="1726" id="xix.xix-p52.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xix-p53"> The whole Senate of Antioch were imprisoned till

lodging.</p></note> may be
discharged, and that those who are about to be sent into exile may
return back again. They too are our members. With us they have
buffetted the waves, with us they have withstood the storm! Let us,
then, beseech the merciful God, that with us they may enjoy the
calm! Let no one say, “What farther concerns me? I am freed from
danger; such an one may perish; such another may be destroyed!”
Let us not provoke God by this indifference; but lament, as if we
ourselves were in the same peril. So let us supplicate God with
intense earnestness, fulfilling that saying of Paul, “Remember
them that are in bonds, as bound with them; and them which suffer
adversity, as being yourselves also in the body.<note place="end" n="1727" id="xix.xix-p53.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xix-p54"> <scripRef passage="Heb. xiii. 3" id="xix.xix-p54.1" parsed="|Heb|13|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Heb.13.3">Heb.

advantage to ourselves; for nothing useth so much to delight God,
as that we should be very ready to mourn for our own members. Him
therefore let us supplicate in common, both for things present, and
for things to come; in order that He may deliver us from punishment
hereafter. For the things present, whatever they are, are
endurable, and have an end; but the torments there are immortal,
and interminable! And while we are consoled, let us also ourselves
endeavour to fall no more into such sins, knowing that hereafter<note place="end" n="1729" id="xix.xix-p55.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xix-p56"> <i>i.e</i>., if not thus amended.</p></note> we shall
enjoy no pardon! Let us, then, all in common prostrate ourselves
before God; and both while we are here, and when we are at home,
let us say, “Thou, O Lord, art righteous in all things which Thou
hast done towards us; for Thou hast brought upon us by a just

<p class="c9" id="xix.xx-p4">1. <span class="c12" id="xix.xx-p4.1">I have</span> observed
many persons rejoicing, and saying one to another, “We have
conquered; we have prevailed; the half of the fast is spent.” But
I exhort such persons not to rejoice on this account, that the half
of the fast is gone, but to consider whether the half of their sins
be gone; and if so, then to exult. For this is a fit subject of
gratification. This is what is to be sought after, and for which
all things are done, that we may correct our defects; and that we
may not quit the fast the same persons as we entered upon it, but
in a cleansed state; and 
<pb n="459" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_459.html" id="xix.xx-Page_459" />that having laid aside all that belongs to evil
habits, we may thus keep the sacred feast, since if the case be
otherwise, we shall be so far from obtaining any advantage, that
the completion of the fast will be the greatest injury to us. Let
us, therefore, not rejoice that we have gone through the length of
the fast, for this is nothing great; but let us rejoice, if we have
got through it with fresh attainments, so that when this is over,
the fruit of it may shine forth. For the gain of winter is more
especially manifested after the season is gone by. Then, the
flourishing corn, and the trees teeming with leaves and fruit,
proclaim, by their appearance, the benefit that has accrued to them
from the winter! Let the same thing also take place with us. For
during the winter, we have enjoyed divers and frequent showers,
having been during the fast partakers of a continued course of
instruction, and have received spiritual seeds, and cut away the
thorns of luxury.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xx-p5">2. Wherefore let us persevere, retaining with
all diligence what we have heard; that when the fast is over, the
fruit of the fast may abound, and that by the good things we
gathered from the fast, we may remember the fast itself.<note place="end" n="1733" id="xix.xx-p5.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xx-p6"> See end of Hom. VI.</p></note> If thus we
fashion ourselves, we shall, when the fast returns, welcome it
again with pleasure. For I see many who are so feeble-minded, that
at the present season they are anxious about the following Lent;
and I have heard many saying, that after their liberation from the
fast, they are insensible to any pleasure from this remission, on
account of their anxiety about the coming year. What can be more
feeble-minded than this? I ask; and what is the cause of this? It
is, that when the fast is arrived, we do not take pains that the
concerns of the soul may be well ordered, but we limit the fast
solely to an abstinence from food. Since, were we to reap the full
benefit of it in a reformation of conduct, we should wish the fast
to come round every day, receiving in very deed an experience of
its good effects; and we should never cast away the desire of it,
or be dejected and anxious whilst expecting it.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xx-p7">3. For there is nothing whatever that will be
able to afflict one who is well ordered in mind, and careful about
his own soul; but he will enjoy a pure and continued pleasure. And
that this is true ye have to-day heard from Paul, who exhorts us,
saying, “Rejoice in the Lord always, and again I say,
rejoice.”<note place="end" n="1734" id="xix.xx-p7.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xx-p8"> <scripRef passage="Phil. iv. 4" id="xix.xx-p8.1" parsed="|Phil|4|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Phil.4.4">Phil. iv.
4</scripRef>.</p></note> I know
indeed that to many this saying seems impossible. “For how is it
possible,” says some one, “that he who is but a man, can
continually rejoice? To rejoice is no hard matter, but to rejoice
continually, this seems to me to be impossible.” For many are the
causes of sadness, which surround us on all sides. A man has lost
either a son, or a wife, or a beloved friend, more necessary to him
than all kindred; or he has to sustain the loss of wealth; or he
has fallen into sickness; or he has to bear some other change of
fortune; or to grieve for contemptuous treatment which he did not
deserve; or famine, or pestilence, or some intolerable exaction, or
circumstances in his family trouble him;—nay, there is no saying
how many circumstances of a public or private nature are accustomed
to occasion us grief. How then, he may say, is it possible to
“rejoice always?” Yea, O man! it is possible; and if it were
not so, Paul would not have given the exhortation; nor would a man
endowed with spiritual wisdom have offered such counsel; and for
this reason I have constantly said to you, and will not cease to
say, that what ye could no where have learnt from any other, that
wisdom ye may here meditate. For mankind are universally desirous
of pleasure,<note place="end" n="1735" id="xix.xx-p8.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xx-p9"> See Arist. Eth. 1, ch. 5, and Plat. Phileb., where
the general aim of human action is discussed. Speaking popularly,
St. Chrysostom does not enquire by what name it is most correct to
call the real object of our desires. He is satisfied with shewing
that the highest pleasure, satisfaction, joy, or whatever it may be
called, is found in God. And this is a better beginning, for
practical purposes, than a philosophical definition. But see
Hooker, b. i. c. vii. and Butler, ser. xi. xii. xiii.</p></note> and of
rejoicing; and for this, they do all, say all, and undertake all
things. Therefore it is, that the merchant goes on a voyage, in
order that he may amass wealth; and he amasses wealth, to the end
that he may rejoice over what he has treasured up. The soldier also
for this reason exercises his warfare, and the husbandman his
husbandry; for this each man plies his art. Those also who love
dominion, love it for this end, that they may obtain glory; and
they desire to obtain glory, that they may rejoice; and any one may
perceive that each of our undertakings is directed to this point,
and that every man looking to this makes haste to go towards it
through a variety of means.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xx-p10">4. For as I said, all love gladness, but all are not
able to attain it, since they know not the way which leads to it;
but many suppose that the source of it is in being rich. But if
this were its source, no one possessed of wealth would ever be sad.
But in fact many of the rich think life not worth living, and would
infinitely prefer death when they experience any hardship; and of
all men these are the most liable to excessive sadness. For you
should not look to their tables, or their flatterers, and
parasites, but to the trou<pb n="460" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_460.html" id="xix.xx-Page_460" />ble that comes of such things,
the insults, the calumnies, the dangers, and the distresses, and
what is far worse, that they meet these reverses unpractised, and
know not how to take them philosophically, or to bear with
fortitude what befalls them; whence it happens that calamities do
not appear to them such as they are in their own nature, but even
things which are really light come to seem intolerable; whereas,
with regard to the poor, the contrary takes place; things that are
irremediable seem easy to be borne, since they are familiar with
many such. For it is not so much the nature of the events as the
disposition of the sufferers, that makes the evils which come upon
us seem great or small. And that I may not go a long way off for
examples of both these facts, I will speak to you of what has
lately befallen ourselves. Behold then how all the poor escaped,
and the populace are delivered from the danger, and enjoy an entire
freedom! but those who manage the affairs of the city, the men who
keep their studs of horses, and preside over the public games, and
such as have borne other public charges,<note place="end" n="1736" id="xix.xx-p10.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xx-p11"> Proof of wealth.</p></note> they are now the inmates of the
prison, and fear the worst; and they alone pay the penalty of the
deeds that have been perpetrated by all, and are in a state of
constant terror; and they are now the most wretched of men, not
because of the greatness of the danger, but on account of the
luxury in which hitherto they have lived! Many, at least when
exhorted by us, and counselled to sustain these adverse affairs
with fortitude, said this, “We never practised any thing of the
kind, and do not know how to exercise such philosophy; this is why
we need so much consolation.”</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xx-p12">5. Others again suppose, that to enjoy good health
is the source of pleasure. But it is not so. For many of those who
enjoy good health have a thousand times wished themselves dead, not
being able to bear the insults inflicted on them. Others again
affirm, that to enjoy glory, and to have attained to power, and to
administer the highest offices, and to be flattered by multitudes,
is productive of continual gladness. But neither is this the case.
And why do I speak of other offices of power? For although we were
to mount up in thought to royalty itself, and to him who lives in
that station, we should find it encompassed with a diversity of
troubles, and having so many necessary causes the more of sadness,
in proportion as it is surrounded with a greater weight of affairs.
And what need is there to speak of wars, and battles, and the
insurrections of barbarians? Oftentimes he has reason to fear those
by whom he is surrounded at home. For many of those monarchs who
have escaped from the hands of their enemies, have not escaped the
conspiracies of their own body-guards. And kings have of necessity
as many causes of sadness as there are waves on the ocean. But if
monarchy is unable to render life devoid of grief, then what else
can possibly achieve this? Nothing, indeed, of this life; but this
saying of Paul alone, brief and simple as it is, will of itself
open to us this treasure.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xx-p13">6. For many words are not needed, nor a long round
of argument, but if we only consider his expression, we shall find
the way that leads to it. He does not simply say, “Rejoice
always;” but he adds the cause of the continual pleasure, saying,
“Rejoice in the Lord always.” He who rejoices “in the
Lord,” can not be deprived of the pleasure by any thing that may
happen. For all other things in which we rejoice are mutable and
changeable, and subject to variation. And not only does this
grievous circumstance attend them, but moreover while they remain
they do not afford us a pleasure sufficient to repel and veil the
sadness that comes upon us from other quarters. But the fear of God
contains both these requisites. It is steadfast and immoveable, and
sheds so much gladness that we can admit no sense of other evils.
For the man who fears God as he ought, and trusts in Him, gathers
from the very root of pleasure, and has possession of the whole
fountain of cheerfulness. And as a spark falling upon a wide ocean
quickly disappears, so whatever events happen to the man who fears
God, these, falling as it were upon an immense ocean of joy, are
quenched and destroyed! This indeed is most to be wondered at, that
whilst things which minister sadness are present, the man should
remain joyful. For if there was nothing to produce grief, it would
be no great matter to him that he was able continually to rejoice.
But that at a time when he is urged to sadness by the pressure of
many things, he is superior to all these, and is blithe in the
midst of sorrow, this is truly a matter for astonishment! And as no
one would have wondered that the three Children were not burnt, if
they had remained far off from the furnace of Babylon! (for the
circumstance that astonished all was, that having been so long in
such close contact with the fire, they left it more free from hurt
than those who had not been in contact with it); so also we are
able to say of the saints, that if no temptation had fastened
itself upon <pb n="461" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_461.html" id="xix.xx-Page_461" />them, we should not
have wondered at their continual rejoicing. But the point worthy of
admiration, and that which surpasses human nature, is this, that
being encircled on all sides with innumerable waves, their
condition is easier than that of those who enjoy an entire
calm!</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xx-p14">7. From what has been said, it is evident that
amongst those who are outside the church it is impossible to find
any situation in life, encircled with continual gladness from the
things without. But that the believer cannot possibly be deprived
of the enjoyment of a continued pleasure is what I will now proceed
to prove, to the end that ye may not only learn, but also emulate
this painless condition of life. For suppose a man having nothing
for which to condemn himself, but cherishing a good conscience, and
yearning after the future state, and the fulfilment of those good
hopes; what, I ask, will be able to throw such a person into
sadness? Does not death seem the most insupportable of all things?
Yet the expectation of this is so far from grieving him, that it
makes him the more joyful; for he knows that the arrival of death
is a release from labour, and a speeding toward the crowns and
rewards laid up for those who have contended in the race of piety
and virtue. But is it the untimely end of his children? Nay, he
will also bear this nobly, and will take up the words of Job,
“The Lord gave, the Lord hath taken away; as it seemed good unto
the Lord, so is it come to pass. Blessed be the name of the Lord
for ever.”<note place="end" n="1737" id="xix.xx-p14.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xx-p15"> <scripRef passage="Job i. 21" id="xix.xx-p15.1" parsed="|Job|1|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Job.1.21">Job i.

death and loss of children cannot grieve, much less can the loss of
money, or dishonour, or reproaches, or false accusations, at any
time affect a soul so great and noble; no, nor anguish of body,
since the Apostles were scourged, yet they were not made sad. This,
indeed, was a great thing; but what is much more, instead of being
made sad, they considered their very scourgings, as a ground of
additional pleasure. “And they departed from the presence of the
council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame
for the name of Christ.”<note place="end" n="1738" id="xix.xx-p15.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xx-p16"> <scripRef passage="Acts v. 41" id="xix.xx-p16.1" parsed="|Acts|5|41|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.5.41">Acts v.

such a one? Well, he was taught by Christ to rejoice in these
revilings. “Rejoice,”<note place="end" n="1739" id="xix.xx-p16.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xx-p17"> Sav. <i>Blessed are ye, &amp;c</i>. as in

glad, when they shall say all manner of evil against you falsely
for my sake; for great is your reward in heaven.”<note place="end" n="1740" id="xix.xx-p17.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xx-p18"> <scripRef passage="Matt. v. 11, 12" id="xix.xx-p18.1" parsed="|Matt|5|11|5|12" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.11-Matt.5.12">Matt. v.
11, 12</scripRef>.</p></note> But
suppose a man hath fallen into disease? Well, he hath heard another
admonishing, and saying, “In disease and poverty trust thou in
Him; for as gold is tried in the fire, so are acceptable men in the
furnace of humiliation.”<note place="end" n="1741" id="xix.xx-p18.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xx-p19"> <scripRef passage="Ecclesiasticus 2.4,5" id="xix.xx-p19.1" parsed="|Sir|2|4|2|5" osisRef="Bible:Sir.2.4-Sir.2.5">Ecclus. ii. 4, 5</scripRef>.</p></note> Since, therefore, neither death,
nor loss of money, nor bodily disease, nor dishonour, nor reproach,
nor any other thing of that nature, will be able to grieve him, but
makes him even the more joyful, what foundation for sadness will he
have at any time?</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xx-p20">8. “What then,” says some one, “used not
the Saint to be in sadness? Do you not hear Paul saying, “I have
great heaviness, and continual sorrow in my heart?”<note place="end" n="1742" id="xix.xx-p20.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xx-p21"> <scripRef passage="Rom. ix. 2" id="xix.xx-p21.1" parsed="|Rom|9|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.9.2">Rom. ix.
2</scripRef>.</p></note> This,
indeed, is the thing to wonder at, that sorrow brought a gain, and
a pleasure that resulted from the gain; for as the scourge did not
procure them anguish, but gladness; so also again the sorrow
procured them those great crowns. And this is the paradox; that not
only the sadness of the world, but also its joy, contains extreme
loss; but in the case of spiritual things, it is exactly the
reverse; and not the joy only, but the sadness too contains a rich
treasure of good things! But how, I proceed to explain. In the
world, a person often rejoices, on beholding an enemy in trouble;
and by this joy he draws on himself a great punishment. Again,
another person mourns, on seeing a brother fall; and because of
this sadness he will procure for himself much favour with God.
Seest thou how godly sorrow is better and more profitable than the
joy of the world? Thus also Paul sorrowed for sinners, and for
those who disbelieved in God; and this sorrow was the means of
laying up a great reward for him. But that I may make what I say
more clear, and that ye may know that although what I assert is
very strange, it is nevertheless true, viz. that grief is often
capable of refreshing distressed souls, and of rendering a burdened
conscience light: consider how often women, when they have lost
their most beloved children, break their hearts, and perish, if
they are forbidden to mourn, and to shed tears. But if they do all
which those who are sad, are wont to do, they are relieved, and
receive consolation. And what wonder that this should be the case
with women, when you may even see a prophet affected in a similar
manner? Therefore he was continually saying, “Suffer me—I will
weep bitterly—labour not to comfort me, because of the spoiling
of the daughter of my people.”<note place="end" n="1743" id="xix.xx-p21.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xx-p22"> <scripRef passage="Isa. xxii. 4" id="xix.xx-p22.1" parsed="|Isa|22|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.22.4">Isa.
xxii. 4</scripRef>.</p></note> So that, oftentimes, sadness is
the bearer of consolation; and if it is so with regard to this
world. much more with regard to spiritual things. <pb n="462" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_462.html" id="xix.xx-Page_462" />Therefore he says, “Godly
sorrow worketh repentance unto salvation, not to be repented
of.”<note place="end" n="1744" id="xix.xx-p22.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xx-p23"> <scripRef passage="2 Cor. vii. 10" id="xix.xx-p23.1" parsed="|2Cor|7|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.7.10">2 Cor.

indeed seems to be obscure; but what he says is to this effect:
“If thou grievest over wealth, thou art nothing profited. If for
sickness, thou hast gained nothing, but hast increased thy
affliction.”</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xx-p24">9. And I have heard many, after such
experience, blame themselves, and say, What advantage is it that I
have grieved? I have not recovered my money, and I have injured
myself. But if thou hast grieved on account of sin, thou hast
blotted it out, and hast reaped the greatest pleasure. If thou hast
grieved for thy brethren who have fallen, thou hast both encouraged
and comforted thyself, and hast also restored them; and even if
thou wert not to profit them, thou hast an abundant recompense. And
that thou mayest learn that this grieving for those who have
fallen, though we should not at all benefit them, still brings us a
large reward, hear what Ezekiel says; or rather, what God Himself
speaks through him. For when He had sent certain messengers to
overturn the city, and to consume all the dwellings with sword and
fire, along with their inhabitants, He thus charges one of them:
“Set a mark upon the forehead of the men that groan, and are in
anguish.” And after charging the others, and saying, “Begin ye
from mine holy ones,” He goes on to add, “But upon whomsoever
the sign is, touch them not.”<note place="end" n="1745" id="xix.xx-p24.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xx-p25"> <scripRef passage="Ezek. ix. 4" id="xix.xx-p25.1" parsed="|Ezek|9|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ezek.9.4">Ezek. ix.
4</scripRef>.</p></note> For what reason, tell me? Because
although they avail nothing, they nevertheless lament the things
which are done, and deplore them. And again, He accuses others,
saying, That in their luxury, and gluttony, and enjoyment of great
security, when they beheld the Jews carried away into captivity,
they did not grieve, nor partake of their sadness. And hear what He
says, reproaching them: “They suffered nothing in the affliction
of Joseph:”<note place="end" n="1746" id="xix.xx-p25.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xx-p26"> <scripRef passage="Amos vi. 6" id="xix.xx-p26.1" parsed="|Amos|6|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Amos.6.6">Amos vi.

Joseph the whole people. And again: “The inhabitants of Ænan
went not forth to bewail the house next unto them.”<note place="end" n="1747" id="xix.xx-p26.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xx-p27"> <scripRef passage="Mich. i. 4" id="xix.xx-p27.1" parsed="|Mic|1|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Mic.1.4">Mich. i. 4</scripRef>.</p></note> For
although they are justly punished, God willeth that we should
condole with them, and not rejoice or insult. “For if I that
punish,” saith He, “do not this rejoicingly; nor take pleasure
in their punishment; for “I do not at all will the death of the
sinner;”<note place="end" n="1748" id="xix.xx-p27.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xx-p28"> <scripRef passage="Ezek. xviii. 32" id="xix.xx-p28.1" parsed="|Ezek|18|32|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ezek.18.32">Ezek.

right that thou shouldest imitate thy Lord; and shouldest mourn for
this very thing, that the sinner hath provided matter and occasion
for a just punishment.” So that if any one entertains a godly
sorrow, he will thence reap a great advantage.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xx-p29">10. Since therefore those who are scourged are
more blessed than the scourgers, and those in tribulation among us
than those who are free from it outside the Christian pale; and
those who are sad are more blessed than those in pleasure; what
further source of tribulation shall we have? On this account we
should call no man happy, save him only who lives according to God.
These only the Scripture terms blessed. For “blessed,” it is
said, “is the man who hath not walked in the counsel of the
ungodly. Blessed is he whom Thou chastenest, and teachest him out
of Thy law. Blessed are the undefiled in the way. Blessed are all
they who trust in Him. Blessed is the people whose God is the Lord.

everywhere pronounce blessed none of the rich, or of the well-born,
or of the possessors of glory, but the man who has gotten hold of
virtue. For what is required of us is, that in every thing we do or
suffer, the fear of God should be the foundation; and if you
implant this as the root, not merely will ease, and honour, and
glory, and attention, produce fruits that shall be pleasurable to
thee; but hostilities also, and calumnies, and contempt, and
disgrace, and torments, and all things without exception. And just
as the roots of trees are bitter in themselves, and yet produce our
sweetest fruits, so, verily, godly sorrow will bring us an abundant
pleasure. They know, who have often prayed with anguish, and shed
tears, what gladness they have reaped; how they purged the
conscience; how they rose up with favourable hopes! For as I am
always saying, it is not the nature of the things, but our
disposition, which is wont to make us sad or joyful. If then we can
render the latter such as it ought to be, we shall have a pledge
for all gladness. And just as, with the body, it is not so much the
nature of the air, or the things it meets from without, as its own
internal condition, that either injures or assists it, so also it
is in the case of the soul; and much more so; for in the one case,
there is the necessity of nature; in the other, the whole is seated
in the power of choice. Therefore Paul, when he had endured
innumerable evils—shipwrecks, wars, persecutions, plots, the
assaults of robbers, and things too numerous to be <pb n="463" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_463.html" id="xix.xx-Page_463" />recounted, dying also daily
deaths—was so far from grieving or being discontented, that he
gloried, and rejoiced, and said, “I now rejoice in my sufferings,
and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my
flesh.”<note place="end" n="1751" id="xix.xx-p31.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xx-p32"> <scripRef passage="Coloss. i. 24" id="xix.xx-p32.1" parsed="|Col|1|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Col.1.24">Coloss.

glorying signifies an extension of pleasure.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xx-p34">11. If then thou desirest joy, seek not after
riches, nor bodily health, nor glory, nor power, nor luxury, nor
sumptuous tables, nor vestures of silk, nor costly lands, nor
houses splendid and conspicuous, nor any thing else of that kind;
but pursue that spiritual wisdom which is according to God, and
take hold of virtue; and then nought of the things which are
present, or which are expected, will be able to sadden thee. Why do
I say to sadden? Verily, the things that make others sad, will
prove to thee an accession of pleasure. For scourges, and death,
and losses, and slanders, and the being evil entreated, and all
such things, when they are brought upon us for God’s sake, and
spring from this root, will bring into our souls much pleasure. For
no one will be able to make us miserable, if we do not make
ourselves such; nor, on the other hand, blessed, if we do not make
ourselves such, following up the grace of God.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xx-p35">12. And that ye may learn that he only is blessed,
who feareth the Lord, I will now demonstrate this to you, not by
what has happened in past times, but by what has befallen
ourselves. Our city was in danger of being utterly effaced; and no
man among the rich, or eminent, or illustrious, dared to appear in
public, but all fled, and hurried out of the way. But they who
feared God, the men who passed their time in monasteries, hastened
down with much boldness, and set all free from this terror; and the
terrible events that had taken place, and the threats which had
been expected to be put into execution, were so far from causing
them to fear, or from throwing them into anxiety, that although
they were placed far off from the calamity, and had no share in it,
they cast themselves willingly into the midst of the fire, and
rescued all; and as for death, which seems universally terrible and
awful, they awaited it with the utmost readiness, and ran to meet
it with more pleasure than others do towards principalities and
honours. And why, but because they knew, that this is the greatest
principality and honour? And they shewed in very deed that he only
is blessed who lays hold of the wisdom which is from above, that he
undergoes no change and sustains no adversity, but enjoys a
continued tranquillity, and laughs to scorn all things which seem
to be sorrowful. At the present time at least, those who were once
in power are oppressed by much sadness, inhabiting the prison, and
loaded with chains, and daily expecting to be put to death. But
these men on the contrary enjoy the purest pleasure; and if it be
their lot to suffer anything terrible, this, and the very things
which seem formidable to others, are welcome to them, for they know
well towards what point they are running, and what lot will await
them when they depart hence. But whilst they live with so much
exactness, and smile at death, they nevertheless grieve for others,
and reap therefrom, in turn, the greatest advantage. Let us then be
in earnest to take care of our souls, and nothing which may come
unlooked for can make us sad. And on behalf of those who are in
prison, let us beseech God that He will deliver them from their
present calamity. For it was in God’s power at once to release us
from this dire evil, and not to suffer even the smallest part of it
to remain; but in order that we may not again go back to our former
negligence, He hath provided that the torrent of these evils should
subside gently and by little and little, holding us fast to the
same pious resolutions.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xx-p36">13. And that this is true, and that many would
have gone back to their former supineness, if we had been released
from the whole difficulty at once, is manifest from this
circumstance; that whilst yet the remnants of the calamity are
left, whilst the sentence of the Emperor is yet doubtful, and those
who conducted the affairs of the city are all in prison,<note place="end" n="1753" id="xix.xx-p36.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xx-p37"> See Libanius ad Helleb.</p></note> many of
our fellow inhabitants, through their inordinate desire of bathing,
run to the river, there making endless merriment, behaving
wantonly, leaping, dancing, and dragging women after them. What
pardon can such be worthy of? What kind of excuse can they offer?
Or rather, what kind of punishment and vengeance do they not
deserve? The head of the city is in the public prison; our members
are in exile; the sentence concerning them is doubtful; and dost
thou, I ask, dance, sport, and laugh? “Why, we could not
endure,” says some one, “to remain without the bath?” O
shameless disposition, sordid and perverted! How many months, I
ask, how many years, have past? Thou hast not been as yet shut out
from the bath for twenty days; and thou art as much distressed and
discontented, as if thou hadst continued without washing for
a <pb n="464" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_464.html" id="xix.xx-Page_464" />whole year! Tell
me, was this thy state, when thou wert expecting an attack from the
military, when thou wert daily anticipating bring put to death,
when thou fleddest to the deserts, and wast hurrying to the
mountain tops? If any one had then proposed to thee to remain “a
year” without the bath, so that thou mightest be rescued from the
impending distress, wouldest thou not readily have accepted the
proposal, and submitted to it? When, therefore, it were becoming
that thou shouldest give thanks to God, Who hath freed thee from
all these things without any loss, dost thou again grow wanton and
contemptuous; and when the fear has passed away, turn back afresh
to a worse state of negligence? Have these dire events really
touched thee, and yet art thou so desirous of the baths? Why, if
the bath had been permitted, would not the calamity of those who
are yet in confinement have been sufficient to persuade those who
are not in the same grievous condition to be forgetful of every
luxury? Life itself is at stake, and dost thou remember the baths,
and desire to be luxurious? Dost thou despise the danger because
thou hast now escaped it? Take heed lest thou entangle thyself in
the necessity of a greater punishment, and call back in larger
measure the wrath which is removed, and experience the very thing
which Christ declared concerning the devils. For He says, that
“when the unclean spirit is gone out, and afterwards findeth the
house void and swept, he taketh seven other spirits more wicked
than himself, and entereth into the soul, and the last state of
that man is worse than the first.”<note place="end" n="1754" id="xix.xx-p37.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xx-p38"> <scripRef passage="Luke xi. 24, 26" id="xix.xx-p38.1" parsed="|Luke|11|24|0|0;|Luke|11|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.11.24 Bible:Luke.11.26">Luke xi.

those who had come to Antioch from the country—also on the

<p class="c9" id="xix.xxi-p4">1. <span class="c12" id="xix.xxi-p4.1">Ye</span> have revelled
during the last few days in the Holy Martyrs! Ye have taken your
fill of the spiritual feast! Ye have all exulted with honest
exultation! Ye have beheld their ribs laid bare, and their loins
lacerated; the blood flowing forth all around; ten thousand forms
of torture! Ye have seen human nature exhibiting that which is
above nature, and crowns woven with blood! Ye have danced a goodly
dance throughout the whole city; this, your noble captain<note place="end" n="1757" id="xix.xxi-p4.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxi-p5"> Flavian, who had returned before Easter.</p></note> leading
you on; but sickness compelled me to remain at home, although
against my will. But if I did not take a part in the festival, I
partook of the pleasure of it. If I could not have the enjoyment of
your public assembly, yet did I share in your gladness. For such is
the power of love, that it makes those who are not actually in the
enjoyment to rejoice equally with those who are; persuading them to
think the good things of their neighbour common to themselves.
Therefore even whilst I sat at home, I was rejoicing with you; and
now whilst I am not yet entirely freed from my sickness, I have
risen up, and run to meet you, that I may see your much desired
faces, and take a part in the present festival.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xxi-p6">2. For I think the present day to be a very
great festival indeed on account of our brethren, who by their
presence beautify our city, and adorn the Church; a people foreign
to us in language,<note place="end" n="1758" id="xix.xxi-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxi-p7"> It seems that they spoke not the Greek, but the
Syriac language.</p></note> but in harmony with us concerning
the faith, a people passing their 
<pb n="465" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_465.html" id="xix.xxi-Page_465" />time in tranquillity, and leading an honest
and sober life. For among these men there are no spectacles of
iniquity—no horse racings, nor harlots, nor any of that riot
which pertains to a city, but every kind of licentiousness is
banished, and great sobriety flourishes every where. And the reason
is, that their life is a laborious one; and they have, in the
culture of the soil, a school of virtue and sobriety, and follow
that art which God introduced before all others into our life. For
before the sin of Adam, when he enjoyed much freedom, a certain
tillage of the ground was enjoined upon him; not indeed a laborious
or a troublesome one, but one which afforded him much good
discipline, for he was appointed, it is said, “to till the
garden, and to keep it.” Each of these men you may see at one
time employed in yoking the labouring oxen, and guiding the plough,
and cutting the deep furrow; and at another ascending the sacred
pulpit,<note place="end" n="1759" id="xix.xxi-p7.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxi-p8"> τὸ ἱερον βῆμα. The
whole of the raised part of the Church, entered by none but the
clergy, was so called. On the cases in which secular occupations
were allowed to the clergy, see Bingham, b. vi. c. iv. sec. 13.</p></note> and
cultivating the souls of those under their authority; at one time
cutting away the thorns from the soil with a bill-hook, at another
purging out the sins of the soul by the Word. For they are not
ashamed of work like the inhabitants of our city, but they are
ashamed of idleness, knowing that this has taught every kind of
wickedness; and that to those who love it, it has proved a teacher
of iniquity from the beginning.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xxi-p9">3. These are our philosophers, and theirs the
best philosophy, exhibiting their virtue not by their outward
appearance, but by their mind. The pagan philosophers are in
character no wise better than those who are engaged on the stage,
and in the sports of actors; and they have nothing to shew beyond
the threadbare cloak, the beard, and the long robe! But these,
quite on the contrary, bidding farewell to staff and beard, and the
other accoutrements, have their souls adorned with the doctrines of
the true philosophy, and not only with the doctrines, but also with
the real practice. And were you to question any one of these, who
live a rustic life at the spade and plough, as to the dogmas
respecting which the pagan philosophers have discoursed an infinite
deal, and have expended a multitude of words, without being able to
say any thing sound; one of these would give you an accurate reply
from his store of wisdom. And not only is this to be wondered at,
but that they confirm the credibility of these doctrines by their
actions. For of the fact that we have an immortal soul, and that we
shall hereafter render an account of what we have done here, and
stand before a fearful Tribunal, their minds are at once thoroughly
persuaded, and they have also regulated their whole course of life
by such hopes as these; and have become superior to all worldly
show, instructed as they have been by the sacred Scriptures, that
“all is vanity, yea, vanity of vanities,”<note place="end" n="1760" id="xix.xxi-p9.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxi-p10"> <scripRef passage="Eccl. i. 2" id="xix.xxi-p10.1" parsed="|Eccl|1|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Eccl.1.2">Eccl. i.
2</scripRef>.</p></note> and they do not greedily long for
any of those things which seem to be so splendid.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xxi-p11">4. These too know how to philosophize
concerning God, even as God hath determined; and if, taking one of
them, you were now to bring forward some pagan philosopher;—or
rather, now you could not find one!<note place="end" n="1761" id="xix.xxi-p11.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxi-p12"> St. Chrysostom here satirically alludes to the
flight of the philosophers from the city during the panic
succeeding the sedition. See Homily XVII.</p></note>—But if you were to take one of
these, and then open the books of their ancient philosophers, and
go through them, and institute an enquiry by way of parallel as to
what these now answer, and the others in their day philosophically
advanced; you would see how much wisdom belonged to the former, and
how much folly to the latter. For whilst some of those would aver,
that the things existing were destitute of a providence, and that
the creation had not its origin from God; that virtue was not
sufficient for itself, but stood in need of wealth, and nobility,
and external splendour, and other things still more ridiculous; and
whilst these, on the other hand, would discourse wisely respecting
Providence, respecting the future Tribunals of judgment, respecting
the creative power of God, bringing forth all things out of
nothing, as well as respecting all other points, although at the
same time they were entirely destitute of worldly schooling; who
could but learn from hence the power of Christ, which hath proved
these unlearned and simple persons to be as much wiser than those,
who make so much boast of their wisdom, as men of discretion are
seen to be in comparison of little children? For what harm can
result to them from their simplicity in regard to learning, when
their thoughts are full of much wisdom? And what advantage have
those philosophers from this learning, when the understanding is
devoid of right thoughts? It were just as if one should have a
sword that had its hilt of silver, whilst the blade was weaker than
the vilest lead. For truly these philosophers have their tongue
decked out with words and names, but their understanding is full of
mere weakness and good for nothing. Not so with these philosophers,
but quite the reverse. Their understanding is full of spiritual
wis<pb n="466" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_466.html" id="xix.xxi-Page_466" />dom<note place="end" n="1762" id="xix.xxi-p12.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxi-p13"> From the marg. reading, al. “philosophy.”</p></note> and their
mode of life is a transcript of their doctrines. Amongst these
there are no luxurious women; there are no ornaments of dress, nor
colours, nor paints; but all such corruption of manners is
discountenanced. Hence the population under their charge are the
more readily trained to sobriety, and the law which Paul gave, when
he directed that food and covering should be had, and nothing more
be sought after, they most rigidly observe.<note place="end" n="1763" id="xix.xxi-p13.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxi-p14"> <scripRef passage="1 Tim. vi. 8" id="xix.xxi-p14.1" parsed="|1Tim|6|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.6.8">1 Tim.
vi. 8</scripRef>.</p></note> Amongst them, there are no
perfumed unguents to fascinate the senses;<note place="end" n="1764" id="xix.xxi-p14.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxi-p15"> Comp. <i>Georg</i>. ii. 466.</p></note> but the earth bringing forth
herbs, prepares for them a varied fragrance of flowers, above all
the skill of perfumers. For this reason, their bodies as well as
souls enjoy a sound state of health, inasmuch as they have banished
all luxury of diet, and driven off all the evil floods of
drunkenness; and they eat just as much as suffices for subsistence.
Let us then not despise them because of their outward appearance,
but let us admire their mind. For of what advantage is the external
habit, when the soul is more wretchedly clad than any beggar! The
man ought to be praised and admired, not for dress, nay more, not
for his bodily form, but for his soul. Lay bare the soul of these
men, and you will see its beauty and the wealth it possesses, in
their words, in their doctrines, and in the whole system of their
manners!</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xxi-p16">5. Let the Gentiles then be ashamed, let them
hide their heads, and slink away on account of their philosophers,
and their wisdom, wretched as it is beyond all folly! For the
philosophers that have been amongst them in their lifetime have
hardly been able to teach their doctrines to a very few, who can
easily be numbered; and when any trifling peril overtook them, they
lost even these. But the disciples of Christ, the fishermen, the
publicans, and the tent-makers, in a few years brought over the
whole world to the truth; and when from that time, ten thousand
perils have been constantly arising, the preaching of the Gospel
was so far from being put down, that it still flourishes and
increases; and they taught simple people, tillers of the ground,
and occupied with cattle, to be lovers of wisdom. Such are the
persons, who beside all the rest having deeply rooted in them that
love which is the source of all good things,<note place="end" n="1765" id="xix.xxi-p16.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxi-p17"> <scripRef passage="Eph. iii. 17" id="xix.xxi-p17.1" parsed="|Eph|3|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Eph.3.17">Eph. iii.

so long a journey, that they might come and embrace their
fellow-members.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xxi-p18">6. Come then, and in return for these favours,
(I speak of their love and kind feeling), let us give them a
provision, and so send them home; and let us again raise the
question concerning oaths; that from the minds of all we may pluck
up by the roots this evil custom. But first, I desire to put you a
little in mind to-day of the things we spoke of lately.<note place="end" n="1766" id="xix.xxi-p18.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxi-p19"> Bingham asserts, that this Homily and Homily
XV. appear to have been preached on the same day, <i>
Antiquities</i>, b. 14, c. 4, sec. 8, vol. 4. The opening of the
Homily disproves this. Bingham’s mistake is easily accounted for,
by the wording of this passage in the Greek.</p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xxi-p20">When the Jews, having been released from
Persia, and set free from that tyranny, were returned back to their
own county, “I saw,” saith one, “a flying sickle, twenty
cubits in length, and ten cubits broad.”<note place="end" n="1767" id="xix.xxi-p20.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxi-p21"> <scripRef passage="Zech. v. 1, 2" id="xix.xxi-p21.1" parsed="|Zech|5|1|5|2" osisRef="Bible:Zech.5.1-Zech.5.2">Zech. v.
1, 2</scripRef>.</p></note> They heard also the Prophet giving
them this instruction, “This is the curse, that goeth forth over
the face of the whole land, and entereth into the house of him that
sweareth falsely; and it shall rest in the midst thereof, and throw
down the timber and all the stones.” When we had read this
passage, we also enquired then why it was, that it should destroy
not the swearer only, but also his house, and we stated this to be
the reason; that God will have the punishments of the most grievous
sins to remain continually visible; that all may afterwards learn
prudence. Inasmuch then as it was necessary that the perjurer when
dead should be buried, and committed to the bosom of the earth; in
order that his wickedness might not be buried along with him, his
house was made a heap, so that all who passed by, beholding it, and
learning the reason of the overthrow, might avoid imitating the
sin.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xxi-p22">7. This also happened at Sodom. For when they burned
in their lust one towards another, then too the very earth itself
was burned up, being kindled by the fire from above. For He
designed, that the vengeance of this sin should permanently
remain.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xxi-p23">And observe the mercy of God! Those who had sinned,
He caused not to continue burning to the present day, but when they
had been for once in flames, He buried them; and burning up the
face of the ground, He placed it visibly before all who after
should desire to look at these things; and now the sight of the
land, through all the generations since, hath given an admonition
beyond all powers of speech, crying out as it were, and saying,
“Dare not to do the deeds of Sodom, lest ye suffer the lot of
Sodom!” For precept commonly makes not so deep an impression upon
the mind as a fearful spectacle does, which bears upon it the
vestiges of calamity though all time. And persons that have visited
these places bear witness, who 
<pb n="467" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_467.html" id="xix.xxi-Page_467" />often, when they hear the Scripture discoursing
of these things, are not much terrified; but when they have gone
and stood upon the site, and see the whole surface of it
disfigured, and have witnessed the effects of the fire, with soil
no where visible, but every thing dust and ashes, they come away
astonished with the sight, and taking with them a strong lesson of
chastity. For truly, the very nature of the punishment was a
pattern of the nature of the sin! Even as they devised a barren
intercourse, not having for its end the procreation of children, so
did God bring on them such a punishment, as made the womb of the
land ever barren, and destitute of all fruits! For this reason also
He threatened to destroy the dwellings of the swearers, in order
that by their punishments, they may make others to be more
self-controlled.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xxi-p24">8. But I am ready to shew to-day, not the
destruction of one, two, or three houses in consequence of oaths,
but that of a whole city and of a people beloved of God; of a
nation that had always enjoyed much of the divine care; and of a
race that had escaped many dangers.<note place="end" n="1768" id="xix.xxi-p24.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxi-p25"> St. Chrysostom here carries on the argument
against the use of oaths, which he had broken off in Homily XIV.,
after ending the history of Saul and Jonathan.</p></note> For Jerusalem herself, the city of
God, which had the holy ark, and all that divine service;—where
there were once prophets, and the grace of the Spirit, and the ark;
and the tables of the covenant, and the golden pot;—where angels
were frequent visitors;—this city, I say, when a multitude of
wars took place, and many foreign nations made attacks upon it, as
if girt by a wall of adamant, ever laughed them all to scorn, and
whilst the land was utterly destroyed, sustained no injury! And not
only is this to be wondered at, but that frequently in driving out
its enemies, it inflicted upon them a heavy blow, and enjoyed so
much of the providential care of God, that God Himself said, “I
found Israel as a bunch of grapes in the desert; and I beheld your
fathers as the earliest fruit on the fig tree.”<note place="end" n="1769" id="xix.xxi-p25.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxi-p26"> <scripRef passage="Hosea ix. 10" id="xix.xxi-p26.1" parsed="|Hos|9|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Hos.9.10">Hosea ix.

of the city itself: “As olive berries on the extremity of the
highest bough, and they shall say, Do them no harm.”<note place="end" n="1770" id="xix.xxi-p26.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxi-p27"> <scripRef passage="Isa. lxv. 8" id="xix.xxi-p27.1" parsed="|Isa|65|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.65.8">Isa. lxv.

Nevertheless, the city beloved of God; that had escaped so many
perils; that had been favoured with pardon, amidst the multitude of
its sins; that alone had been able to avoid captivity, whilst all
the rest were carried away, not once or twice, but very often; was
ruined solely by an oath. But how, I proceed to state.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xxi-p28">9. One of their kings was Zedekiah. This
Zedekiah took an oath to Nebuchadnezzar, king of the barbarians,
that he would remain in alliance with him. Afterwards he revolted,
and went over to the king of Egypt, disdaining the obligation of
his oath, and suffered the things of which ye shall hear presently.
But first, it is necessary to mention the parable of the prophet,
in which he enigmatically represented all these matters: “The
word of the Lord,” saith he, “came to me, saying, Son of man,
put forth a riddle, and speak a parable, and say, Thus saith the
Lord God: A great eagle, with great wings, and long extended, full
of claws.”<note place="end" n="1771" id="xix.xxi-p28.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxi-p29"> <scripRef passage="Ezek. xvii. 2, 3" id="xix.xxi-p29.1" parsed="|Ezek|17|2|17|3" osisRef="Bible:Ezek.17.2-Ezek.17.3">Ezek.
xvii. 2, 3</scripRef>.</p></note> Here he
calls the king of the Babylonians an eagle, and speaks of him as
being “great, and long-winged;” and he calls him long-extended
and “full of claws,” on account of the multitude of his army,
and the greatness of his power, and the swiftness of his invasion.
For just as the wings and claws of the eagle are his armour, so are
horses and soldiers to kings. This eagle, he goes on to say,
“hath the leading<note place="end" n="1772" id="xix.xxi-p29.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxi-p30"> τὸ ἥγημα,
literally the <i>generalship</i>, as that of an army.</p></note> to enter into Lebanon.” What is
meant by the “leading?” Counsel—design. And Judæa is called
Lebanon, because of its situation near that mountain. Afterwards,
intending to speak of the oaths and treaties, “He took,” saith
he, “of the seed of the land, and planted it in a fruitful field,
that it might take root by great waters. He placed it to be looked
upon; and it grew, and became a weak vine, and of small stature,
and it stretched out its branches towards him, and its roots were
under him.”<note place="end" n="1773" id="xix.xxi-p30.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxi-p31"> <scripRef passage="Ezek. xvii. 5, 6" id="xix.xxi-p31.1" parsed="|Ezek|17|5|17|6" osisRef="Bible:Ezek.17.5-Ezek.17.6">Ezek.

calls the city of Jerusalem<note place="end" n="1774" id="xix.xxi-p31.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxi-p32"> Rather the king, who was of the seed (royal) of
the land, but made king by Nebuchadnezzar,

stretched out its branches towards the eagle, and that its roots
were under him, he refers to the treaties and alliances made with
him; and that it cast itself upon him. Next, purposing to declare
the iniquity of this, he saith, “And there was another great
eagle,” (speaking of the Egyptian king), “with great wings, and
having many claws;<note place="end" n="1775" id="xix.xxi-p32.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxi-p33"> In this expression of <i>many claws</i>, and
in some others, the LXX. differs from the Hebrew.</p></note> and the vine did bend itself
toward him, and its tendril toward him, and shot out its branches,
that it might be watered. Therefore, I said, Thus saith the Lord
God: Shall it prosper?”<note place="end" n="1776" id="xix.xxi-p33.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxi-p34"> <scripRef passage="Ezek. vii. 7, 8" id="xix.xxi-p34.1" parsed="|Ezek|7|7|7|8" osisRef="Bible:Ezek.7.7-Ezek.7.8">Ezek.

broken the oath, and the treaties, shall it be able to remain, or
to be safe, or to avoid falling?” Presently, for the purpose of
shewing that this is not to happen, but that it is certainly to be
destroyed on account of the oath, he discourses concerning its
punishment, and alleges the cause. “For its tender roots
and <pb n="468" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_468.html" id="xix.xxi-Page_468" />its fruits
shall become corrupt, and all which springs therefrom shall be
withered.”<note place="end" n="1777" id="xix.xxi-p34.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxi-p35"> <scripRef passage="Ezek. xvii. 9" id="xix.xxi-p35.1" parsed="|Ezek|17|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ezek.17.9">Ezek.
xvii. 9</scripRef>.</p></note> And for
the purpose of shewing that it will not be destroyed by human
strength, but because it hath made God its enemy by means of these
oaths, he subjoins, “Not by a mighty arm, nor by much people, to
pluck it up by its roots.” Such indeed is the parable, but the
prophet again explains it, when he says, “Behold, the king of
Babylon cometh against Jerusalem.”<note place="end" n="1778" id="xix.xxi-p35.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxi-p36"> <scripRef passage="Ezek. xvii. 12" id="xix.xxi-p36.1" parsed="|Ezek|17|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ezek.17.12">Ezek.

things between, he mentions the oaths and the treaties. “For”
saith he, “he shall make a covenant with him;”<note place="end" n="1779" id="xix.xxi-p36.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxi-p37"> <scripRef passage="Ezek. xvii. 14" id="xix.xxi-p37.1" parsed="|Ezek|17|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ezek.17.14">Ezek.

presently, speaking of the departure from it, he goes on to say,
“And he will depart from him, by sending messengers into Egypt,
that they might give him horses and much people.” And then he
proceeds to shew that it is on account of the oath that all this
destruction is to take place. “Surely in the place where the king
dwelleth that made him king, he who hath despised My curse, and
hath transgressed My covenant, in the midst of Babylon he shall
die; and not by great power nor by multitude, because he despised
the oath in transgressing this My covenant; I will surely
recompense upon his own head this My oath which he hath
dishonoured, and My covenant which he hath broken; and I will
spread My net upon him.”<note place="end" n="1780" id="xix.xxi-p37.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxi-p38"> <scripRef passage="Ezek. xvii. 16-20" id="xix.xxi-p38.1" parsed="|Ezek|17|16|17|20" osisRef="Bible:Ezek.17.16-Ezek.17.20">Ezek.

treated contemptuously. Nor merely from the punishment which was
brought upon the city by the oath, but also from the delay, and the
postponement, may it be seen how much God is concerned for the
inviolability of oaths. “For it came to pass,” we are told,
“in the ninth year of the reign of Zedekiah, on the tenth day of
the month, that Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon came, and all
his host, against Jerusalem, and pitched against it, and built a
wall against it round about, and the city was besieged until the

indeed, at once from the first day, have delivered them up, and
have given them into the hands of their enemies; but He permitted
that they should first be wasted for the space of three years, and
experience a most distressing siege; to the end that during this
interval, being humbled by the terror of the forces without, or the
famine that oppressed the city within, they might compel the king,
however unwillingly, to submit to the barbarian; and some
alleviation might be obtained for the sin committed. And to prove
that this is true, and no conjecture of my own, hear what He saith
to him by the prophet: “If thou shalt go forth to the king of
Babylon’s princes, then thy soul shall live, and this city shall
not be burned with fire; and thou shalt live, and thine house. But
if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon’s princes, then
shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans; and they
shall burn it with fire, and thou shalt not escape out of their
hand. And the king said, I am afraid of the Jews that are fallen to
the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hands and they mock
me. But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver thee. Obey, I beseech
thee, the word of the Lord, which I speak unto thee; so shall it be
better for thee, and thy soul shall live. But if thou refuse to go
forth, this is the word that the Lord hath shewed me. All the women
that are left in the king of Judah’s house, shall be brought
forth to the king of Babylon’s princes; and those shall say, The
men who are at peace with thee have deceived thee, and have
prevailed over thee; they shall prevail when thy feet slip; they
are turned away from thee, and they shall bring out all thy wives,
and thy children to the Chaldeans, and thou shalt not escape out of
their hand, for thou shalt be taken by the hand of the king of
Babylon, and this city shall be burned with fire.”<note place="end" n="1783" id="xix.xxi-p40.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxi-p41"> <scripRef passage="Jer. xxxviii. 17-23" id="xix.xxi-p41.1" parsed="|Jer|38|17|38|23" osisRef="Bible:Jer.38.17-Jer.38.23">Jer.

“flying sickle” that “resteth in the swearer’s house;”
and “destroyeth the walls and the timber and the stones.” Be
mindful, I pray, how this oath entered into the city, and
overturned houses, and temple, and walls, and splendid buildings,
and made the city an heap; and that neither the Holy of Holies, nor
the sacred vessels, nor any thing else could ward off that
punishment and vengeance, for that the oath had been transgressed!

flying sickle overthrew the buildings, so did it also cut him down
in his flight. For “the king,” it says, “went forth by night,

expression, “he spake judgment with him?” He demanded of him an
account of his conduct, he pleaded against him; and first he slew
his two sons, that he might be a spectator of the calamity of his
house, and might behold<note place="end" n="1790" id="xix.xxi-p49.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxi-p50"> The last Par. Ed. adopts

he put out his own eyes. For what reason, I ask again, did this
occur? In order that he might go as a teacher to the barbarians,
and too the Jews who dwelt among them; and that they who had eyes
might discern by him who was bereft of sight, how great an evil is
an oath! Nor only these; but all who dwelt by the way, beholding
the man fettered and blinded, might learn by his calamity the
greatness of his sin. Therefore one of the prophets declares, “He
shall not see Babylon.”<note place="end" n="1791" id="xix.xxi-p50.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxi-p51"> <scripRef passage="Ezek. xii. 13" id="xix.xxi-p51.1" parsed="|Ezek|12|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ezek.12.13">Ezek.

be contradictory. But it is not so; for both of these are true. For
he saw not Babylon, though he was carried away to Babylon. How then
did he not see Babylon? Because it was in Judæa he had his eyes
put out; for where the oath had been set at nought, there also was
it vindicated, and he himself subjected to punishment. And how was
he carried away to Babylon? In a state of captivity. For since the
punishment was twofold, deprivation of sight and captivity, the
prophets took them severally. The one saith, “He shall not see
Babylon,” speaking of the loss of his eyes; the other saith,
“He shall be carried away to Babylon,” signifying his
captivity.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xxi-p53">12. Knowing these things, then, brethren, and
gathering up what has been now advanced, as well as what has been
said before; let us at last desist from this evil custom, yea, I
pray and beseech you all! For if in the old dispensation, when the
Jews had not the strictest moral wisdom required of them, but much
condescension was extended to them, such wrath was the effect of
one oath; such capture and captivity; what punishment is it likely
that those who swear should now be subjected to, after an express
law forbidding the practice, and so large an addition of precepts.
Is it, indeed, all that is required, that we come to the assembly,
and hear what is spoken? Why truly it is a reason for greater
condemnation, and for more inevitable punishment, that we are
continually hearing, and yet do not what is bidden! What excuse
shall we have, or what pardon, if assembling here from earliest
youth to latest old age, and enjoying the advantage of so much
instruction, we remain just like them, and do not take pains to
correct a single defect. Let no one henceforth allege custom. For
this is the very thing at which I am indignant and provoked, that
we are not able to get the better of custom. And, pray, if we do
not get the better of custom, how can we get the better of
concupiscence, which hath its root even in the principles of our
nature; for it is natural to feel desire; but to desire wickedly,
comes after of choice. But this practice of swearing takes not even
its first <pb n="470" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_470.html" id="xix.xxi-Page_470" />principle from
nature,<note place="end" n="1793" id="xix.xxi-p53.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxi-p54"> This is the reading in some <span class="c12" id="xix.xxi-p54.1">mss</span>. adopted by Savile, but the Benedictine

<p class="c10" id="xix.xxi-p55">13. And that thou mayest learn that not from
the difficulty of the thing, but through our inattention, this sin
has advanced to such a pitch, let us call to mind how many things
far more difficult than these, men accomplish; and that too without
expecting any recompense therefrom. Let us think what services the
Devil imposes; how laborious, how troublesome they are; and yet,
the difficulty has not become an obstacle to these services. For
what can be more difficult, I ask, than when any young person
delivering himself up to those, who undertake to make his limbs
supple and pliant, uses his most strenuous exertion to bend his
whole body into the exact shape of a wheel, and to turn over upon
the pavement; his powers being tasked at the same time through the
eyes, and through the movement of the hands, as well as other
convolutions for the purpose of being transformed into the likeness
of woman-kind.<note place="end" n="1794" id="xix.xxi-p55.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxi-p56"> Xenophon, in his Symposium, describes a dancing
girl as performing tricks of this kind, “turning over backwards,
bent into the form of a wheel,” and “reading and writing while
whirled on a potter’s wheel,” &amp;c. (on which Socrates takes
occasion to say how much women might learn). Wilkinson observes,
that this bears some resemblance to a feat indicated in Egyptian
paintings, not less than 1300 years before the age of Socrates. See
Manners and Customs of the Ancient Egyptians, vol. ii. p. 415. Of
the degradation attached to such feats, see Herodotus, b. vi. c.
129.</p></note> Yet
neither the difficulty of these feats, nor the degradation arising
from them, are thought of. And again, those who are dragged upon
the dancing-stage, and use the members of the body as though they
were wings, who that beholds them can help being struck with
wonder? So too they who toss knives aloft in the air one after
another, and catch them all by the handle, whom might they not put
to shame of those who refuse to undergo any labour for the sake of
virtue? And what can any one say of those men, who balancing a pole
on the forehead, keep it just as steady as a tree rooted in the
ground? And this is not the only marvellous part of the affair but
that they set little children to wrestle with one another on the
top of the tree; and neither the hands, nor any other part of the
body assisting, the forehead alone sustains the pole unshaken, and
with more steadiness than any kind of fastening. Again: another
walks on the slenderest rope, with the same fearlessness as men do
when they run over level plains. Nevertheless these things, which
even in thought seem impracticable, have become possible by art.
What like this have we, I ask, to allege concerning oaths? What
kind of difficulty? what toil? what art? what danger? There is only
needed on our part a little earnestness, and the whole of our task
will be quickly performed.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xxi-p57">14. And do not tell me, “I have accomplished
the greater part of it;” but if thou hast not accomplished the
whole, consider that thou hast not as yet done any thing; for this
little, if neglected, is destruction to all the rest. Often indeed
when men have built a house, and put on the roof, they have
destroyed the whole fabric, by not making any concern of a single
tile that has been shaken off from it. And one may see the same
thing occur with respect to garments; for there too if a small hole
is made, and not repaired, a large rent is the consequence. And
this also is frequently the case in regard to floods; for these, if
they find but a small entrance, let in the whole torrent. Thou
also, then, even if thou hast fortified thyself all around, and but
a small part be left still unfortified, yet block up this also
against the devil, that thou mayest be made strong on all sides!
Thou hast seen the sickle! Thou hast seen the head of John! Thou
hast heard the history pertaining to Saul! Thou hast heard the
manner of the Jewish captivity! And beside all these, thou hast
heard the sentence of Christ declaring, that not only to commit
perjury, but to swear in any way, is a diabolical thing, and the
whole a device of the evil one.<note place="end" n="1795" id="xix.xxi-p57.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxi-p58"> So <i>cometh of evil</i> may be understood.
St. Chrysostom scarcely allows an oath in any case, unless perhaps

legenda</i>. Other Fathers, and the usual practice, allowed them on
<i>just occasions</i>. See Bingham, xvi. c. vii. sec. 4. Where,
however, St. Athanasius uses a qualified form of putting an oath.
See also his Comment on <scripRef passage="Ps. lxiii. 11" id="xix.xxi-p58.2" parsed="|Ps|63|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.63.11">Ps. lxiii. 11</scripRef>, he speaks almost as strongly
as St. Chrysostom, as does also St. Basil, still using himself an
affirmation before God, and discussing questions of obligation by
oath.</p></note> Thou hast heard that every where
perjuries follow oaths. Putting all these things then together,

as a mere charm. On the use of charms he is severe, though used by
Christians, and containing nothing of decidedly heathenish import.
He considers making the sign of the cross as <i>opposed</i> to

do thou write the commands of the Gospel and its laws upon thy
mind. Here there is no need of gold or property, or of buying a
book; but of the will only, and the affections of the soul
awakened, and the Gospel will be thy surer guardian, carrying it as
thou wilt then do, not outside, but treasured up within; yea, in
the soul’s secret chambers. When thou risest up then from thy
bed, and <pb n="471" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_471.html" id="xix.xxi-Page_471" />when thou

this law; and thou wilt see, how he will forthwith abstain from
this custom. Is it not therefore truly absurd, that little
children, out of the fear we inspire, should perform this
commandment, and that we should not fear God as our sons fear
us?</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xxi-p61">15. What then I said before this, I now again
repeat. Let us lay down a law for ourselves in this matter; not to
meddle either with public or private affairs until we have
fulfilled this law; and then surely under the pressure of this
obligation we shall easily conquer, and we shall at once adorn
ourselves, and decorate our city. For consider what a thing it
would be to have it said every where throughout the world, “A
practice becoming Christians is established at Antioch, and you
will hear no one giving utterance to an oath, even though the
greatest necessity is laid upon him!” This is what the
neighbouring cities will certainly hear; nay, not the neighbouring
cities only, but even to the ends of the earth will the report be
conveyed. For it is indeed probable that both the merchants who mix
with you, and others who arrive from this place, will report all
these matters. When, therefore, many persons in the way of encomium
mention the harbours of other cities, or the markets, or the
abundance of wares, enable those who come from hence to say, that
there is that at Antioch, which is to be seen in no other city; for
that the men who dwell there would sooner have their tongues cut
out, than suffer an oath to proceed from their mouths! This will be
your ornament and defence, and not only so, but it will bring an
abundant reward. For others also will certainly emulate, and
imitate you. But if, when a person has gained but one or two,<note place="end" n="1798" id="xix.xxi-p61.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxi-p62"> <scripRef passage="Jas. v. 20" id="xix.xxi-p62.1" parsed="|Jas|5|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Jas.5.20">Jas. v.

receive so great a reward from God; what recompense shall ye not
receive when ye are the instructors of the whole world. It is your
duty then to bestir yourselves, to be watchful, and to be sober;
knowing that not only from our own personal good works, but from
those we have also wrought in others, shall we receive the best
recompense, and enjoy much favour with God, which may He grant us
all continually to enjoy, and hereafter to obtain the kingdom of
heaven, in Christ Jesus our Lord; to Whom with the Father, and the
Holy Ghost, be glory and power both now and ever, and world without

suffer us to-day to discourse to you concerning this commandment.
For as it is not to be imagined that the fornicator and the
blasphemer can partake of the sacred Table, so it is impossible
that he who hath an enemy, and bears malice, can enjoy the holy
Communion. And this with good reason. For a man when he has
committed fornication, or adultery, at the same time that he hath
accomplished his lust, hath also completed the sin; and should he
be willing by watchful living to recover from that fall, he may
afterwards, by manifesting great penitence, obtain some relief. But
he who is resentful worketh the same iniquity every day, and never
brings it to an end. In the former case the deed is over, and the
sin completed; but here the sin is perpetrated every day. What
excuse can we then have, I ask, for delivering ourselves willingly
to such an evil monster? How canst thou ask thy Lord to be mild and
merciful to thee, when thou hast been so hard and unforgiving to
thy fellow-servant?</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xxii-p9">3. But thy fellow-servant hath treated thee
with contempt perhaps? Yes! and thou hast treated God with contempt
oftentimes. And what comparison is there between a fellow-servant
and the Lord? As to the former, when he was perchance in some way
injured, he insulted thee, and thou wert exasperated. But thou
insultest the Lord, when thou art neither treated with injustice
nor ill-will by Him, but receiving blessing of Him day by day.
Consider, then, that if God chose to search out rigourously what is
done against Him, we should not live a single day. For the prophet
saith, “If Thou wilt be extreme to mark iniquity, O Lord, O Lord,
who shall stand?”<note place="end" n="1803" id="xix.xxii-p9.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxii-p10"> <scripRef passage="Ps. cxxx. 3" id="xix.xxii-p10.1" parsed="|Ps|30|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.30.3">Ps. cxxx.

things, of which the conscience of every sinner is aware, and of
which he no has no human witness, but God only; were we to be
called to account for those which are open and admitted, what
allowance could we expect for such sins? What if He were to
scrutinize our listlessness and negligence in our prayers; and how,
whilst standing before God and supplicating Him, we do not exhibit
even so much fear and reverence for Him as servants do toward their
masters, as soldiers do toward their officers, as friends do toward
friends?<note place="end" n="1804" id="xix.xxii-p10.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxii-p11"> Herbert’s Poems, No. lxviii.,</p>

discoursest with a friend, thou givest heed to what thou art doing,
but when waiting on God on account of thy sins, and asking pardon
for so many offences, and thinking that thou shalt obtain
forgiveness, thou art often listless; and whilst thy knees are
lying on the ground, thou sufferest thy mind to wander every where,
in the market, or in the house, babbling the while with thy mouth
vainly and to no purpose! And this we experience, not once or
twice, but frequently! Did God then choose to scrutinize this
alone, do you think that we could obtain pardon, or be able to find
any excuse? Truly, I think not!</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xxii-p13">4. But what if the evil-speakings which we unkindly
utter every day one against another, were brought forward against
us; as well as the rash judgments with which we condemn our
neighbour; and that for no reason, but 
<pb n="473" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_473.html" id="xix.xxii-Page_473" />because we are fond of blaming, and given to find
fault; what, I say, should we be able to allege in defence? Again,
should He scrutinize those roving glances of ours, and those evil
desires which we carry in the mind, so frequently admitting
disgraceful and impure thoughts from the unlicensed wandering of
the eyes, what punishment must we not sustain? And should He demand
a reason for our revilings, (for He saith, “Whosoever shall say
to his brother, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire,”) how
could we, forsooth, open our mouths, or move our lips at all, or
say any thing great or small in reply? Moreover, as to the
vainglorious feelings we allow in our prayers, our fastings, our
almsgiving, were we to scrutinize, them,—I do not say, were God,
but were we ourselves, who are the sinners, to do this,—should we
be able to lift up our eyes toward heaven? Then, as to the deceits
which we devise one against another—praising a brother now,
whilst he is present, and discoursing as with a friend; and when he
is absent, reviling him; can we endure the punishments of all
these? Then what of the oaths? or what of the lying? what of the
perjuries? what of the unjust anger, and of the envy with which we
too often regard men when honoured, not enemies only, but also
friends? Furthermore, what of the fact, that we are pleased when
others suffer evil, and account the misfortunes of others a
consolation for our own distress?</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xxii-p14">5. But suppose the penalty were exacted for our
listlessness in our solemn assemblies what would our condition be?
For this ye cannot but know, that often whilst God Himself is
addressing us all by His prophet, we are holding frequent and long
conversations with those near us, about matters which in no way
concern us. Passing by, then, all the rest, should He choose to
exact of us the penalty due for this sin only, what hope of
salvation will there be? For do not suppose that this offence is a
small one, but if thou wouldest be aware of its magnitude, examine
how this very thing is regarded among men, and then thou wilt
perceive the enormity of the sin. Just venture, when some
magistrate is talking to thee, or rather some friend who is of
somewhat superior dignity, to turn from him, and enter into
conversation with thy servant; and thou wilt then perceive, what
thou venturest on in dealing thus with God! For if he be any one of
the more distinguished classes, he will even demand reparation of
thee for such an insult. Yet God, whilst He is treated with as
great, and still greater contempt than this, every day; and that
not by one, or two, or three persons, but by almost all of us; is
still forbearing and longsuffering, not in regard to this alone,
but to other things which are far more grievous. For these things
are what must be admitted, and what are obvious to all, and by
almost all men they are daringly practised. But there are yet
others, which the conscience of those who commit them is privy to.
Surely, if we were to think of all this; if we were to reason with
ourselves, supposing even that we were the cruelest and harshest of
men, yet upon taking a survey of the multitude of our sins, we
should for very fear and agony be unable to remember the injury
done by others towards ourselves. Bear in mind the river of fire;
the envenomed worm; the fearful Judgment, where all things shall be
naked and open! Reflect, that what are now hidden things, are then
to be brought to light! But shouldest thou pardon thy neighbour all
these sins which till then await their disclosure are done away
with here; and when thou shalt depart this life, thou wilt not drag
after thee any of that chain of transgressions; so that thou
receivest greater things than thou givest. For many such
transgressions, indeed, we have often committed, which no other
person knoweth; and when we think, that on That Day these our sins
shall lie exposed to the eyes of all, upon the public theatre of
the universe, we are in pain beyond any punishment, being choked
and strangled by our conscience. Yet this shame, great as it is;
these sins, these punishments, great as they are; there is a
possibility of purging away through forgiveness exercised toward
our neighbour.</p>

wrath; but retain it not in thy mind; think not of it; part with
all thy resentment; do away the sore. For thou supposest that thou
art paying him back the injury; but thou art first tormenting
thyself, and setting up thy rage as an execu<pb n="474" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_474.html" id="xix.xxii-Page_474" />tioner within thee in every part, and
tearing up thine own bowels. For what can be more wretched than a
man perpetually angry? And just as maniacs, who never enjoy
tranquility, so also he who is resentful, and retains an enemy,
will never have the enjoyment of any peace; incessantly raging, as
he does, and daily increasing the tempest of his thoughts calling
to mind his words and acts, and detesting the very name of him who
has aggrieved him. Do you but mention his enemy, he becomes furious
at once, and sustains much inward anguish; and should he chance to
get only a bare sight of him, he fears and trembles, as if
encountering the worst evils. Yea, if he perceives any of his
relations, if but his garment, or his dwelling, or street, he is
tormented by the sight of them. For as in the case of those who are
beloved, their faces, their garments, their sandals, their houses,
or streets, excite us, the instant we behold them; so also should
we observe a servant, or friend, or house, or street, or any thing
else belonging to those we hate and hold our enemies, we are stung
by all these things; and the strokes we endure from the sight of
each one of them are frequent and continual.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xxii-p20">7. What is the need then of sustaining such a
siege, such torment and such punishment? For if hell did not
threaten the resentful; yet for the very torment resulting from the
thing itself we ought to forgive the offences of those who have
aggrieved us. But when deathless punishments remain behind, what
can be more senseless than the man, who both here and there brings
punishment upon himself, while he thinks to be revenged upon his
enemy! For suppose that we see him still prosperous, then we are
ready to die of chagrin; but if in an adverse condition, we are in
fear, lest some propitious turn of events should take place. But
for both of these there is stored up for us an inevitable
punishment. For, “Rejoice not,” he saith, “when thine enemy
stumbleth.”<note place="end" n="1809" id="xix.xxii-p20.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxii-p21"> <scripRef passage="Prov. xxiv. 17" id="xix.xxii-p21.1" parsed="|Prov|24|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Prov.24.17">Prov.

true, I will endeavour to make it manifest from the events which
have happened in this city. For when the persons impeached of those

is human, and hath its bounds, would have triumphed over all anger,
much more would the punishment to come, if it had continual
possession of our thoughts, expel from the soul not only
resentment, but every evil imagination? For what is easier, I ask,
than to get rid of resentment against the injurer? Is there any
long journey to be undertaken? Is there any expenditure of money?
Is the aid of others to be invoked? It suffices only to resolve,
and the good deed at once reaches the goal. What punishment, then,
must we not deserve, if on account of worldly affairs we stoop to
slavish occupations; and shew a servility unworthy of ourselves;
and expend money; and enter into conversation with porters, that we

men; and do and say all manner of things, so that we may perfectly
attain the end we have in view; and yet cannot endure, for the sake
of God’s laws, to entreat a brother who hath injured us, but
consider it a disgrace to be the first to make advances. Art thou
ashamed, tell me, when thou art going to be the first to make gain?
Rather, on the contrary, you ought to be ashamed of persisting in
this passion; and waiting until the person who has committed the
injury comes to you to be reconciled; for this is a disgrace, and a
reproach, and the greatest loss.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xxii-p25">8. For he who comes the first it is, who reaps all
the fruit; and when at the entreaty of another thou layest aside
thine anger, the good work is to be accounted his; for thou hast
discharged the law as doing a favour to him, not as obeying God.
But if, when no one entreats, when not even the man who has done
the injury approaches, or solicits thee, thou thyself dismissing
from thy thoughts all shame, and all delay, runnest forward freely
to the injurer, and dost quell anger entirely, the good deed
becomes wholly thine own, and thou shalt receive all the reward. If
I say, “Practise fasting,” thy plea, perchance, is <pb n="475" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_475.html" id="xix.xxii-Page_475" />bodily weakness. If I say,
“Give to the poor,” it is poverty, and bringing up children. If
I say, “Make time for the assembles of the Church,” it is
worldly cares. If I say, “Give heed to what is spoken, and
consider the power of what is taught,” it is want of learning. If
I say, “Correct another,” you say, “When counsel is given
him, he takes no heed, for I have often spoken, and been
scorned.” Frigid, as such pretences are, yet you have some
pretences to allege. But suppose I say, “Dismiss thine anger,”
which of these wilt thou then allege? For neither infirmity of
body, nor poverty, nor lack of culture, nor want of leisure, nor
any other thing of that kind hast thou to advance; but this sin is
above all other the most inexcusable. How wilt thou be able to
stretch thine hands toward heaven, or how to move thy tongue, or to
ask pardon? For although God be desirous to pardon thy sins, thou
thyself dost not suffer Him, while thou retainest that of thy
fellow-servant! But suppose that he is cruel, fierce, and savage,
and greedy of revenge and retaliation? Why for this reason thou
oughtest especially to grant forgiveness.<note place="end" n="1813" id="xix.xxii-p25.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxii-p26"> See on <scripRef passage="Rom. xii. 21" id="xix.xxii-p26.1" parsed="|Rom|12|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.12.21">Rom. xii. 21</scripRef>, Hom. XXII.</p></note> Hast thou been wronged much, and
robbed, and slandered, and injured in matters of the first
importance; and dost thou wish to see thine enemy punished? Yet
even for this, it will be of use to thee to pardon him. For suppose
that thou thyself takest vengeance, and prosecutest it, either by
words, by deeds, or imprecation against the adversary; then God
will not afterwards prosecute it too, inasmuch as thou hast taken
thy revenge; and not only will He not prosecute the matter for
thee, but will also demand a penalty of thee as a despiser of
Himself. For if this same thing takes place amongst mankind, viz.
that if we beat the servant of another, the master is indignant,
and calls the act an insult (for although we be treated
injuriously, whether by slaves, or by freemen, it is fitting that
we should await the legal decisions of magistrates or masters); if
then even amongst men, to avenge ourselves would not be safe, how
much more so when God is the avenger!</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xxii-p27">9. Hath thy neighbour wronged and grieved thee, and
involved thee in a thousand ills? Be it so, yet do not prosecute
vengeance on thine own part, lest thou do desire to thy Lord! Yield
the matter to God, and He will dispose of it much better than thou
canst desire. To thee He has given charge simply to pray for the
injurer; but how to deal with him, He hath ordered thee to leave to
Himself. Never canst thou so avenge thyself, as He is prepared to
avenge thee, if thou givest place to Him alone, and dost not utter
imprecations on him who has aggrieved thee; but sufferest God to be
sole arbiter of the sentence. For although we may pardon those who
have aggrieved us; although we may be reconciled; although we may
pray for them; yet God does not pardon, unless they themselves are
converted, and become better. And He withholds pardon, with a view
to their own advantage. For He praises thee, and approves thee for
thy spiritual wisdom; but visits him, in order that he may not grow
worse by thy wisdom. So that the common saying on this subject is
not to the point. For many there are, who when I reproach them
because after being exhorted to be reconciled to their enemies,
they will not be persuaded to it, think fit to proffer this
apology, which is nothing less than a cloak for their iniquity.
“I am unwilling,” says one, “to be reconciled, lest I should
make the man worse, more ill-tempered, and more disposed to treat
me contemptuously hereafter.” Besides this, they also make this
plea: “Many people,” say they, “think it is weakness in me to
come first to a reconciliation, and to entreat my enemy.” All
these things are foolish; for the Eye that slumbers not has seen
thy good intention; wherefore, it behoveth thee to make no account
of the opinion of thy fellow-servants, when thou hast gained the
opinion of the Judge, Who is about to try thy cause.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xxii-p28">10. But if thy concern be, lest thine enemy should
become worse by thy clemency learn this,—that it is not thus he
is made worse; but far rather if thou art unreconciled. For
although he were the vilest of men; although he might neither
confess nor publish it openly; yet he will silently approve thy
Christian wisdom, and in his own conscience will respect thy
gentleness. Should he, however, persist in the same iniquity,
whilst thou art endeavouring to soften and conciliate, he will have
to abide the heaviest punishment from God. And that ye may know,
that although we should pray for our enemies, and for those who
have injured us, God does not pardon, if they are likely to become
worse by our forbearance, I will mention to you an ancient piece of
history. Miriam once spake against Moses. What then did God do? He
sent a leprosy upon her, and made her unclean; notwithstanding that
in other respects she had been meek and modest. Afterwards, when
Moses himself, the party injured, besought that the wrath might be
removed, God consented not: but what did 
<pb n="476" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_476.html" id="xix.xxii-Page_476" />He say? “If her father had but spit in
her face, should she not be ashamed? Let her remain,” saith He,
“without the camp seven days.”<note place="end" n="1814" id="xix.xxii-p28.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxii-p29"> <scripRef passage="Numb. xii. 14" id="xix.xxii-p29.1" parsed="|Num|12|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Num.12.14">Numb.
xii. 14</scripRef>.</p></note> But what He means is to this
effect. “If,” saith He, “she had a father, and he had put her
away from his presence, would she not have undergone the rebuke? I
approve thee indeed for thy fraternal piety, and thy meekness and
clemency; but I know when is the due time to remit her
punishment.” Do thou then shew all humanity towards thy brother;
and do not pardon his offences in the desire of a greater
punishment for him, but of thy tenderness and good will; yet
understand this very plainly, that the more he shall slight thee,
whilst thou art labouring to conciliate, so much the greater
punishment will he draw down upon himself.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xxii-p30">11. What sayest thou? tell me, Is he the worse
for thy attentions? This is blame to him, but thy praise. Thy
praise, that, whilst seeing him thus behave himself, thou didst not
desist from doing God’s will in conciliating him. But to him it
is blame, because he has not been made better by thy clemency.

far more desirable that others should be blamed because of us, than
we because of them.” Make me not this frigid reply, of saying,
“I am afraid of its being thought that I made an overture to him
out of fear; and that he will therefore despise me the more.”
Such a reply indicates a childish and foolish mind, agitated about
human approbation. Let him suppose, that it was out of fear you
made the first advance to him; your reward will be so much the
greater; since, being aware of this beforehand, you still consented
to endure all for the fear of God. For he who is in chase of human
approbation, and seeks reconciliation for that end, curtails the
recompense of reward; but he who is quite sure of the fact, that
many will vilify and ridicule him, and even then does not desist,
from the attempt at reconciliation, will have a twofold, yea, a
threefold crown. And this is indeed the man who does it for the
sake of God. Nor tell me, that the man has wronged thee in this, or
in that particular; for if he hath displayed, in his conduct
towards thee, every kind of iniquity that is in man, yet even so
God hath enjoined thee to forgive him all!</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xxii-p32">12. Lo! I forewarn, and testify, and proclaim
this with a voice that all may hear! “Let no one who hath an
enemy draw near the sacred Table, or receive the Lord’s Body! Let
no one who draws near have an enemy! Hast thou an enemy? Draw not
near! Wilt thou draw near? Be reconciled, and then draw near, and
touch the Holy Thing!” Nor, indeed, is this my declaration.
Rather it is that of the Lord Himself, Who was crucified for us.
That He might reconcile thee to the Father, He refused not to be
sacrificed, and to shed His blood! And art thou unwilling to utter
a word, or to make the first advance, that thou mayest be
reconciled to thy fellow-servant? Hear what the Lord saith,
concerning those who are in this disposition; “If thou bring thy
gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath
aught against thee”—He does not say, “wait for him to come to
thee,” nor “speak with another as mediator,” nor “entreat
some other,” but “do thou thyself make the advance towards
him.” For the exhortation is, “Go thy way, first be reconciled
to thy brother.”<note place="end" n="1816" id="xix.xxii-p32.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxii-p33"> <scripRef passage="Matt. v. 23, 24" id="xix.xxii-p33.1" parsed="|Matt|5|23|5|24" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.23-Matt.5.24">Matt. v.

Himself account it no dishonour, that the gift should be left

of pardon? Were you to see a member of yours cut off, would you not
use every exertion so that it might be reunited to the body? This
do with regard to thy brethren; when thou seest them cut off from
thy friendship, make all haste to recover them! Do not wait for
them to make the first advance, but press onward, that thou mayest
be foremost to receive the prize.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xxii-p34">13. We are commanded to have only one enemy,
the devil. With him be thou never reconciled! But with a brother,
never be at enmity in thy heart. And if there should be any
narrowness of soul, let it be only an ephemeral thing, and never

reconciled, you will obtain some pardon from God. But if you remain
longer at enmity, that enmity is no longer the result of your being

and of a foul spirit, and one which makes a practice of malice! And
this is not the only terrible thing, that you deprive yourself of
pardon, but that the right course becomes still more difficult. For
when one day is past, the shame becomes greater; and when the
second has arrived, it is still further increased; and if it reach
a third, and a fourth day, it will add a fifth. Thus the five
become ten; the ten, twenty; the twenty an hundred; and thenceforth

irrational passions; nor be ashamed, nor blush, nor say within
yourself, “A short time ago we called each other such names, and
said a vast number of things fit or not fit to be spoken; and shall
I now hurry at once to a reconciliation? Who then will not blame my
excessive easiness?” I answer, no one who has sense will blame
thy easiness; but when thou remainest implacable, then, all persons
will deride thee. Then thou wilt give to the devil the advantage of
this wide breach. For the enmity becomes then more difficult to be
got rid of, not by mere lapse of time, but from the circumstances
too that take place in the meanwhile. For as “charity covereth a
multitude of sins,”<note place="end" n="1818" id="xix.xxii-p35.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxii-p36"> <scripRef passage="1 Pet. iv. 8" id="xix.xxii-p36.1" parsed="|1Pet|4|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Pet.4.8">1 Pet.

that do not exist, and all persons henceforth, are deemed worthy of
credit who turn accusers; who rejoice in the ills of others, and
blaze abroad what is disgraceful in their conduct.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xxii-p37">14. Knowing all these things then, make the first
advance to a brother; lay hold of him before he has entirely shrunk
away from thee; and should it be necessary, to run through all the
city on the same day; should it be necessary to go beyond the
walls, or to take a long journey; still leaving all other things
that may be in hand, attend only to this one work of reconciling
thy brother. For if the work be laborious, reflect that it is for
God’s sake thou undergoest all this, and thou shalt receive
sufficient consolation. Stir up thy soul also when it is shrinking,
and backward, and bashful, and ashamed, by perpetually harping on
this theme and saying, Why art thou delaying? Why art thou
shrinking and holding back? our concern is not for money, nor for
any other of these fleeting things, but for our salvation. God bids
us do all these things, and all things should be secondary to His
commands. This matter is a sort of spiritual merchandise. Let us
not neglect it, let us not be slothful. Let our enemy too
understand that we have taken much pains, in order to do what is
well-pleasing unto God. And though he may again insult, or strike
us, or do any other such thing of a still more grievous kind, let
us sustain all things courageously, since we are not so much
benefitting him thereby, as ourselves. Of all good works, this
shall most especially befriend us on That Day. We have sinned and
offended in many and great matters, and have provoked our Lord.
Through His lovingkindness He hath given us this way of
reconciliation. Let us, then, not betray this good treasure. For
had He not power to charge us simply to make reconciliation, and
not have any reward assigned to it? for whom hath He to gainsay or
rectify His appointment? Nevertheless, through His great
lovingkindness, He hath promised us a large and unspeakable reward,
and one which we must be especially desirous to obtain, the pardon
of our sins; thus also making this our obedience more easy of
performance.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xxii-p38">15. What allowance then can be made for us, if
even when we might receive so great a reward we still do not obey
the Lawgiver, but persist in our contempt; for that this is a
contempt is plain from hence. If the Emperor had laid down a law,
that all those who were enemies should be reconciled to one
another, or have their heads cut off, should we not every one make
haste to a reconciliation with his neighbour? Yes! truly, I think
so! What excuse then have we, in not ascribing the same honour to
the Lord, that we should do to those who are our fellow-servants?
For this reason we are commanded to say, “Forgive us our debts,
as we forgive our debtors.”<note place="end" n="1819" id="xix.xxii-p38.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxii-p39"> <scripRef passage="Matt. vi. 12" id="xix.xxii-p39.1" parsed="|Matt|6|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.6.12">Matt. vi.

merciful, than this precept! He hath made thee a judge of the
pardon of thine own offences! If thou forgivest few things, He
forgives thee few! If thou forgivest many things, He forgives thee
many! If thou pardonest from the heart, and sincerely, God in like
manner also pardons thee! If besides pardoning him thou accountest
him a friend, God will also thus deal with thee; so that the more
he has sinned, so much the more is it necessary that we should
hasten to a reconciliation; since it becomes a cause of greater
offences being forgiven us.<note place="end" n="1820" id="xix.xxii-p39.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxii-p40"> This and similar language of the Fathers, is
startling to many, but is hardly more than a transcript of the
passages of Holy Scripture they refer to. A general acknowledgment

is no pardon for us, if we are mindful of injuries, and that there
is no one who can deliver us? I will make what I assert plain by an
example. Suppose that a neighbour has done you a certain injury,
that he has seized your goods; has confiscated or embezzled them;
and not to confine myself to such a case, let me add to it more
things and worse beside, and whatever you will; he has longed to
destroy you; he has exposed you to a thousand perils; he has
manifested every sort of malice towards you; and left nothing
undone that human wickedness can do? For not to go <pb n="478" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_478.html" id="xix.xxii-Page_478" />over every thing separately, suppose
that he has injured you to such an extent as no one ever injured
any before;—why, even in this case, if you are resentful, you
will not be worthy of pardon. And I will explain how it is so.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xxii-p42">16. If one of your servants owed you an
hundred pieces of gold; and some one again was indebted to him in a
few pieces of silver; and if the servants’ debtor were to come,
and entreat and supplicate you that he might obtain indulgence, and
you were to call in your own servant, and charge him, saying,
“Forgive this man the debt, and from the sum thou owest me I will
deduct this debt;” should that servant afterwards be wicked and
shameless enough to seize on his debtor, could any one then rescue
him out of your hands? Would you not most assuredly inflict a
thousand stripes upon him, as having been insulted to the last
extremity? And very justly too. This also God will do: for He will
say to thee on That Day, “O wicked and villainous servant, yea,
was it of thine own thou forgavest him? Out of what thou wert
indebted to Me, thou wert ordered to account to him. For
“Remit,” He saith, “and I will remit unto thee! although, to
speak truly,<note place="end" n="1822" id="xix.xxii-p42.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxii-p43"> 1 Ven. adds, the things remitted are not
equal.</p></note> if I had
not added this condition, it would have been even then thy duty to
have remitted at the instance of thy Lord. But in this case, I did
not command thee as a master, but I asked it as a favour from a
friend; and I asked it out of My own property; and I promised to
give greater things in return; and yet with all this, thou wert not
made a better man.” Moreover men, when they act in this manner,
put down as much to their own servants’ accounts, as the measure
of the debt is. Thus, for example, suppose the servant owes his
master a hundred pieces of gold; and the debtor of the servant owes
ten pieces, should the latter remit his debt, the master does not
remit him his hundred pieces, but these ten only; and all the rest
he still demands. But it is not so with God; if you remit a<note place="end" n="1823" id="xix.xxii-p43.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxii-p44"> Sav. mar. those.</p></note> few things
to your fellow-servant, He remits all your debt.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xxii-p45">17. Whence does this appear? From the very
Prayer<note place="end" n="1824" id="xix.xxii-p45.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxii-p46"> Often called emphatically, “The Prayer,”
as constantly in the title of Comments on it. Tertullian <i>de
Oratione</i>, and the like.</p></note> itself.
“For if,” saith He, “ye forgive men their debts, your
heavenly Father will forgive your debts.”<note place="end" n="1825" id="xix.xxii-p46.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxii-p47"> <scripRef passage="Matt. vi. 14" id="xix.xxii-p47.1" parsed="|Matt|6|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.6.14">Matt. vi.

between “a hundred pence” and “ten thousand talents,”<note place="end" n="1826" id="xix.xxii-p47.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxii-p48"> <scripRef passage="Matt. xviii. 24, 28" id="xix.xxii-p48.1" parsed="|Matt|18|24|0|0;|Matt|18|28|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.18.24 Bible:Matt.18.28">Matt.
xviii. 24, 28</scripRef>.</p></note> so great
is it between the debts on the one side, and those on the
other!</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xxii-p49">What punishment then must he not deserve, who
when he would receive ten thousand talents, in the room of a
hundred pence,<note place="end" n="1827" id="xix.xxii-p49.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxii-p50"> Denarii.</p></note> yet will
not even so remit this small sum, but offers up the Prayer against
himself. For when thou sayest, “Forgive us, as we forgive,” and
afterwards dost not forgive, thou art supplicating of God nothing
else than that He would entirely deprive thee of all excuse or
indulgence. “But I do not presume to say,” replies some one,
“Forgive me as I forgive” but only, “Forgive me.” But what
matters this? For if thou say it not thyself, yet God so doeth; as
thou forgivest, He forgives. And this He hath made quite evident
from what follows; for there it is said, “If ye forgive not men,
neither doth your heavenly Father forgive you.” Think not,
therefore, that it is a pious caution, not to repeat the whole
sentence; nor offer up the Prayer by halves, but as He bade thee so
pray thou, in order that the very obligation of that expression,
putting thee daily in fear, may compel thee to the exercise of
forgiveness towards thy neighbours.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xxii-p51">18. Do not tell me, “I have besought him
many times, I have intreated, I have supplicated, but I have not
effected a reconciliation.” Never desist till you have reconciled
him. For He said not, “Leave thy gift, and go thy way.” Entreat
thy brother. But, “Go thy way. Be reconciled.”<note place="end" n="1828" id="xix.xxii-p51.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxii-p52"> <scripRef passage="Matt. v. 24" id="xix.xxii-p52.1" parsed="|Matt|5|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.24">Matt. v.
24</scripRef>.</p></note> So that,
although you may have made many entreaties, yet you must not desist
until you have persuaded. God entreats us every day, and we do not
hear; and yet He does not cease entreating. And dost thou then
disdain to entreat thy fellow-servant. How is it then possible for
thee ever to be saved? Suppose that thou hast often pleaded and
been repulsed; for this, however, thou wilt obtain a larger reward.
For in proportion as he is contentious, and thou perseverest in
entreating, so much the more is thy recompense increased. In
proportion as the good work is accomplished with greater
difficulty, and the reconciliation is one of much labour, so much
the greater will be the judgment on him, and so much the brighter
will be the crowns of victory for thy forbearance. Let us not
merely applaud all this, but exemplify it too in our deeds; and
never recede from the work, until we are restored to our former
state of friendship. For it is not enough merely to avoid grieving
an enemy, or doing him an injury, or being in our minds unkindly
disposed towards him; but it is necessary that we should prepare
him to be kindly 
<pb n="479" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_479.html" id="xix.xxii-Page_479" />affected towards ourselves. For I hear many
saying, “I have no hostility; I am not annoyed; neither have I
any thing to do with him.”<note place="end" n="1829" id="xix.xxii-p52.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxii-p53"> Literally anything common with him, οὐδš žχω τι κοινὸν πρὸς αὐτὸν: see end of
Hom. I.</p></note> But this is not what God commands,
that thou shouldest have nothing to do with him; but that thou
shouldest have much to do with him. For this reason he is thy
“brother.”<note place="end" n="1830" id="xix.xxii-p53.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxii-p54"> <i>i.e</i>., is called so in this passage.</p></note> For this
reason He said not, “Forgive thy brother what thou hast against
him. But what then? “Go thy way. First be reconciled to him;”
and should he have “any thing against thee,” yet desist not,
before thou hast reunited the member in friendly concord.” But
thou, who in order that thou mayest obtain a useful servant,
tellest out the gold, and discoursest with many merchants, and
often undertakest long journeys, tell me, art thou not up and doing
to the utmost, in order that thou mayest convert an enemy into a
friend? And how then wilt thou be able to call upon God, whilst
thou art thus neglecting His laws? Assuredly, the possession of a
servant will be of no great profit to us; but the making an enemy a
friend, will render God propitious and favourable toward us; and
will easily set us free from our sins; and gain us praise with men,
as well as great security in our life; for nothing can be more
unsafe than he who has even only a single enemy. For our earthly
reputation is injured, whilst such a man is saying a thousand evil
things of us to every body. Our minds are also in a state of
fermentation, and our conscience disturbed; and we are exposed to a
continual tempest of anxious thoughts.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xxii-p55">19. Now since we are conscious of the truth of
all this, let us set ourselves free from chastisement and
vengeance; and let us shew our reverence for the present feast, by
doing all that has been said; and those same favours which we think
to obtain from the Emperor on account of the feast, let us
ourselves enable others to enjoy. For I hear, indeed, many saying,
that the Emperor, out of his reverence for the Holy Passover, will
be reconciled to the city and will pardon all its offences. How
absurd then is it, that when we have to depend for our safety upon
others, we bring forward the feast, and its claims; but that when
we are commanded to be reconciled one with another, we treat this
same feast with disdain, and think nothing of it. No one, truly, so
pollutes this holy feast, as he does, who, whilst he is keeping it,
cherishes malignity. Or rather, I might say, that such a person
cannot possibly keep it, though he should remain without food ten
days successively. For where there is enmity and strife, there can
be neither fast nor festival. Thou wouldest not dare to touch the
holy Sacrifice with unwashed hands,<note place="end" n="1831" id="xix.xxii-p55.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxii-p56"> If such rules are found fault with because they do
not necessarily involve holy living, it should be remembered that
where strictly kept, they are grounds for such an appeal as this;
and why not, in better men, for holy recollections? They are not
truly parallel to those censured by our Lord, which did not relate
to the treatment of holy things, and here they are treated quite as
subservient to duties of a higher order. The word here rendered
“necessity” may be “compulsion.”</p></note> however pressing the necessity
might be. Approach not then with an unwashed soul! For this is far
worse than the other and brings a heavier punishment. For<note place="end" n="1832" id="xix.xxii-p56.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxii-p57"> <i>i.e</i>., “and if thou bearest malice thy
soul is unwashed; for,” &amp;c.</p></note> nothing so
fills the mind with impurity, as anger remaining constantly within
it. The spirit of meekness settles not where wrath or passion
exists; and when a man is destitute of the Holy Spirit, what hope
of salvation shall he have, and how shall he walk aright? Do not
then, O beloved, whilst thou art desirous to be revenged of thine
enemy, cast thyself down headlong; nor cause thyself to be left
alone without the guardianship of God! For, in truth, if the duty
were a difficult one, yet the greatness of the punishment, which
results from this action of disobedience, were sufficient to arouse
the most slothful and supine, and to persuade them to undergo every
degree of labour. But now our argument has shewn that the duty is
most easy, if we are willing.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xxii-p58">20. Let us not then be negligent of what is our
life, but let us be in earnest; and do every thing, in order that
we may be without an enemy, and so present ourselves at the sacred
Table. For nothing,—nothing, I repeat, of what God commands will
be difficult, if we give heed: and this is evident from the case of
those who are already reformed. How many used to be cheated by the
habit of using oaths, and to fancy this practice extremely
difficult of reformation. Nevertheless, through the grace of God,
when ye put forth but a little effort, ye for the most part washed
yourselves clean of this vice. For this reason I beseech you to lay
aside also what remains, and to become teachers of others. And to
those who have not yet achieved it, but allege to us the length of
time during which they were before swearers, and say that it is
impossible for them to pluck up in a short time that which has been
rooted for many years; I would make this answer, that where any
precept among those commanded by God requires to be put in due
practice, there is no need of length of time, nor of a multitude of
days, nor an interval of years; but of fear only, and reverence of
<pb n="480" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_480.html" id="xix.xxii-Page_480" />soul; and then we shall
be sure to accomplish it, and that in a short time. But lest you
should suppose that I speak these things at random, take a man whom
you think much addicted to swearing; one that swears more times
than he speaks;<note place="end" n="1833" id="xix.xxii-p58.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxii-p59"> <i>i.e</i>., more words than he can articulate.
St. Chrysostom supposes here a man who in his wrath loses the power
of distinct utterance. (Such may be the meaning, or, that he never
speaks without several oaths, or oftener speaks with an oath than
without one, πλείονα ὀμνύοντα μ‚λλον ἢ
φθεγγόμενον.)</p></note> hand this
man over to me for only ten days, and if I do not rid him of all
his habit in these few days, pass the severest sentence on
me.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xxii-p60">21. And that these words are not a vain boast,
shall be made manifest to you from things that have already
happened. What could be more stupid than the Ninevites? What more
devoid of understanding? Yet, nevertheless, these barbarian,
foolish people, who had never yet heard any one teaching them
wisdom, who had never received such precepts from others, when they
heard the prophet saying, “Yet three days, and Nineveh shall be
overthrown,”<note place="end" n="1834" id="xix.xxii-p60.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxii-p61"> <scripRef passage="Jonah ii. 4" id="xix.xxii-p61.1" parsed="|Jonah|2|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Jonah.2.4">Jonah ii.

aside, within three days, the whole of their evil customs. The
fornicator became chaste; the bold man meek; the grasping and
extortionate moderate and kind; the slothful industrious. They did
not, indeed, reform one, or two, or three, or four vices by way of
remedy, but the whole of their iniquity. But whence does this
appear, says some one? From the words of the prophet; for the same
who had been their accuser, and who had said, that “the cry of
their wickedness hath ascended up even to heaven:”<note place="end" n="1835" id="xix.xxii-p61.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxii-p62"> <scripRef passage="Jonah i. 5" id="xix.xxii-p62.1" parsed="|Jonah|1|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Jonah.1.5">Jonah i.

again bears testimony of an opposite kind, by saying, “God saw
that every one departed from their own evil ways.”<note place="end" n="1836" id="xix.xxii-p62.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxii-p63"> <scripRef passage="Jonah iii. 10" id="xix.xxii-p63.1" parsed="|Jonah|3|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Jonah.3.10">Jonah

Chrysostom here of course supposes Jonah to be the <i>author</i> of
the book which bears his name.</p></note> He does
not say, from fornication, or adultery, or theft, but from their
“own evil ways.” And how did they depart? As God knew, not as
man judged of the matter. After this are we not ashamed, must we
not blush, if it turns out that in three days only the barbarians
laid aside all their wickedness, but that we, who have been urged
and taught during so many days,<note place="end" n="1837" id="xix.xxii-p63.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxii-p64"> He refers to his own instructions during Lent: see
the close of this Homily.</p></note> have not got the better of one bad
habit? These men had, moreover, gone to the extreme of wickedness
before; for when you hear it said, “The cry of their wickedness
is come up before me;” you can understand nothing else than the
excess of their wickedness. Nevertheless, within three days they
were capable of being transformed to a state of complete<note place="end" n="1838" id="xix.xxii-p64.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxii-p65"> ὁλόκληρον, wanting no constituent part.</p></note> virtue.
For where the fear of God is, there is no need of days, or of an
interval of time; as likewise, on the contrary, days are of no
service where there is a want of this fear. For just as in the case
of rusted<note place="end" n="1839" id="xix.xxii-p65.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxii-p66"> Or vessels, τὰ ἰωθ™ντα τῶν

implements, he that rubs them only with water, though he spend a
long time on them, will not rid them of all that foulness; but he
that puts them in a furnace, will make them presently brighter than
even those newly fabricated: so too a soul, stained with the rust
of sin, if it cleanse itself slightly, and in a negligent way, and
be every day repenting, will gain no further advantage. But if it
cast itself into the furnace, as it were, of the fear of God, it
will in a very short time purge all away.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xxii-p67">22. Let us not then be procrastinating till
to-morrow. For we “know not what the next day may bring
forth;”<note place="end" n="1840" id="xix.xxii-p67.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxii-p68"> <scripRef passage="Prov. xxvii. 1" id="xix.xxii-p68.1" parsed="|Prov|27|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Prov.27.1">Prov.

say, “we shall conquer this habit by little and little;” since
this little and little will never come to an end. Wherefore,
dismissing that excuse, we should say, “If we do not reform the
practice of swearing to-day, we will not leave off till we do,<note place="end" n="1841" id="xix.xxii-p68.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxii-p69"> οὐκ ‡ποστησόμεθα

accomplished.</p></note> though ten
thousand things were to press us; though it were necessary to die,
or to be punished, or to lose all we have; we will not give the
devil the advantage of slackness, nor the pretext of delay.”
Should God perceive thy soul inflamed, and thy diligence quickened,
then He also Himself will lend His assistance to thy reformation!
Yea, I pray and beseech you, let us be in earnest, lest we also
hear it said of us, “The men of Nineveh shall rise up, and shall
condemn this generation;”<note place="end" n="1842" id="xix.xxii-p69.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxii-p70"> <scripRef passage="Luke xi. 32" id="xix.xxii-p70.1" parsed="|Luke|11|32|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.11.32">Luke xi.

heard, reformed themselves; but we are not converted after frequent
hearing. These were proficients in every part of virtue, but we in
no part. They when they heard that their city would be overthrown
were affrighted; but we, though we have heard of Hell, are not
affrighted: these, men who did not partake of the instructions of
the prophets; we, enjoying the advantage of perpetual teaching, and
of much grace.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xxii-p71">23. These things I now speak to you, not as if
reproving you for your own sins, but for the sake of others; for I
know full well that by you (as I have already observed), this law
concerning swearing has been accomplished. But this does not
suffice for our safety, unless by teaching we amend others, since
he who produced the one talent, restoring as he did the whole
portion committed to him, was 
<pb n="481" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_481.html" id="xix.xxii-Page_481" />punished, because he had not enriched that
with which he was entrusted. Wherefore, let us not regard this
point, that we ourselves have been set free from this sin; but
until we have delivered others from it, let us not desist; and let
every one offer to God ten friends whom he has corrected; whether
thou hast servants, or apprentices:<note place="end" n="1843" id="xix.xxii-p71.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxii-p72"> μαθητὰς.</p></note> or if you have neither servants,
nor apprentices, you have friends; these do thou reform. Further,
do not make me this reply; “We have banished oaths for the most
part, and we are rarely caught in that snare;” but let even this
rarity of offending be got rid of. If you had lost one piece of
gold, would you not go about to all persons, searching and making
enquiry, in order to find it? This do also with regard to oaths. If
you perceive that you have been cheated out of one oath, weep,
lament, as though your whole substance were lost. Again I say what
I did before. Shut up thyself at home; make it a subject of
practice and exercise along with thy wife, thy children, and
domestics. Say to thyself in the first instance, “I must not put
a finger to private or public matters until I have rectified this
soul of mine.” If you will thus school your own sons, they too
will instruct their children in turn, and thus this discipline,
reaching even to the consummation and appearing of Christ, will

matter. If your son has learnt to say, “Believe me;”<note place="end" n="1844" id="xix.xxii-p72.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxii-p73"> πίστευσον.</p></note> he will
not be able to go up to the theatre, or to enter a tavern, or to
spend his time at dice; for that word, lying upon his mouth instead
of a bridle, will make him however unwilling feel shame and blush.

quickly compel him to retreat.<note place="end" n="1845" id="xix.xxii-p73.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxii-p74"> As one who could not talk like others.</p></note> Suppose some persons laugh. Do
thou on the other hand weep for their transgression! Many also once
laughed at Noah whilst he was preparing the ark; but when the flood
came, he laughed at them; or rather, the just man never laughed at
them at all, but wept and bewailed! When therefore thou seest
persons laughing, reflect that those teeth, that grin now, will one
day have to sustain that most dreadful wailing and gnashing, and
that they will remember this same laugh on That Day whilst they are
grinding and gnashing! Then thou too shalt remember this laugh! How
did the rich man laugh at Lazarus! But afterwards, when he beheld
him in Abraham’s bosom, he had nothing left to do but to bewail
himself!</p>

this day to celebrate this holy Feast with much joy and gladness;

sufficient, had we been but delivered from the hitherto impending
evil; and for this we made all our supplication. But the God who
loveth man, and ever in His giving surpasseth our prayers by an
excess of bounty, hath brought back our Father too, sooner than we
could at all have expected. Who would, indeed, have thought that in
so few days, he would have gone, and have had audience with the
Emperor, and set us free from the calamity, and again come back to
us so quickly, as to be able to anticipate the Holy Passover, and
to celebrate it with ourselves? Behold, however, this event, which
was so contrary to expectation, hath been realized! We have
received back our Father; and we enjoy so much the greater
pleasure, inasmuch as we have received him back now beyond our
hopes. For all these things, let us give thanks to the merciful
God, and be amazed at the power, the lovingkindness, the wisdom,
and the tender care which has been manifested on behalf of the
city. For the devil had attempted its entire subversion through the
daring crimes committed; but God, by means of this same calamity,
hath adorned the city, the Priest, and the Emperor; and hath made
them all more illustrious.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xxiii-p6">2. The city hath won renown, because when such
a danger had overtaken her, passing by at once all those who were
in power, those who were surrounded with much wealth, those who
possessed great influence with the Emperor, it fled for refuge to
the Church, and to the Priest of God, and with much faith, rested
itself entirely upon the hope which is from above! Many indeed,
after the departure of the common Father, were ready to terrify
those who lay in prison, by saying, “The Emperor does not lay
aside<note place="end" n="1851" id="xix.xxiii-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxiii-p7"> Sav. relax.</p></note> his wrath,
but is still more provoked, and is thinking of the utter ruin of
the city.” But whilst they were whispering all this, and much
more, they who were then in bonds were not the least intimidated,
but upon our saying, “These things are false, and they are a
device of the devil, who desires to fill you with consternation;”
they replied to us, “We need no consolation to be addressed to
us; for we know where we have taken refuge from the first; and upon
what hope we have rested ourselves. We have fixed our safety upon
the sacred anchor! We have not entrusted this to man, but to the
Almighty God; therefore we are most assuredly confident, that the
result will be favourable; for it is impossible, truly impossible,
that this hope can ever be confounded!” To how many crowns, how
many encomiums, is this equivalent for our city? How much of
God’s favour will it draw down upon us too in our other affairs!
For it is not, indeed it is not a thing belonging to a soul of mean
order to be watchful against the attack of temptations, and to look
to God; and scorning all that is human, to yearn after that Divine
aid.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xxiii-p8">3. The city then hath thus won renown; and the
Priest again not less than the city, for he exposed his life for
all; and while there were many things to hinder him, as the winter,
his age, the feast, and not less than these, his sister, then at
her last breath, he raised himself above all these obstacles, and
did not say to himself, “What a thing is this? Our only remaining
sister, she who hath drawn the yoke of Christ along with me, and
who hath been my domestic companion so long, is now at her last
breath; and shall we desert her, and go hence, and not behold her
expiring, and uttering her paring words? But she indeed was praying
daily, that we might close her eyes,<note place="end" n="1852" id="xix.xxiii-p8.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxiii-p9"> Ducæus quotes <i>Il</i>. xi. 453, <i>
Æn</i>. ix. 486, <i>Stat. Theb</i>. l. 2. <i>Alternâ clauserunt
lumina dextrâ</i>. Plin. 22, 37; <i>Varro apud Nonium</i>; Sigil.
as illustrating the custom of doing these offices for the dead
among heathens.</p></note> and shut and compose her mouth,
and attend to all other things 
<pb n="483" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_483.html" id="xix.xxiii-Page_483" />pertaining to the burial; but now in this case,
as one deserted, and deprived of a protector, she will obtain none
of these offices from her brother; of him whom she especially
desired to obtain them; but when she gives up the ghost, she will
not see him whom she loved more to have with her than all others?
And will not this be heavier to her than dying many times over?
Yes, although I were far away, would it not be right to come with
speed, and do, and suffer any thing, for the purpose of shewing her
this kindness? And now when I am near, shall I leave her, and
taking my departure abandon her? And how then will she sustain the
remainder of her days?”</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xxiii-p10">4. Yet, so far was he from saying any of these
things, that he did not even think of them; but esteeming the fear
of God above all the ties of kindred, he recognized the fact, that
as tempests display the pilot, and dangers the general, so also a
time of trial makes the Priest to become manifest. “All men,”
saith he, “are eagerly looking on us; the Jews as well as the
Greeks; let us not confound the expectations which these have of
us; let us not overlook so great a shipwreck; but having committed
to God all things that pertain to ourselves, let us venture our
life itself too!” Consider, moreover, the magnanimity of the
Priest, and the lovingkindness of God! All those things which he
disregarded, all those he enjoyed; in order that he might both
receive the reward of his readiness, and that he might obtain a
greater pleasure by enjoying them contrary to expectation! He
preferred to celebrate the festival in a foreign place, and far
from his own people, for the sake of the city’s safety. But God
restored him to us before the Paschal feast, so as to take a common
part with us in the conduct of the festival; in order that he might
have the reward of his choice, and enjoy the greater gladness! He
feared not the season of the year; and there was summer during the
whole period he was travelling. He took not his age into account;
and he dispatched this long journey with just as much ease as if he
had been young and sprightly! He thought not of his sister’s
decease nor was enervated by it, and when he returned he found her
still alive, and all things which were disregarded by him, were all
obtained!</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xxiii-p11">5. Thus, the priest hath indeed won renown both with
God and man! This transaction hath also adorned the Emperor with a
splendour beyond the diadem! First, in that it was then made
apparent that he would grant that to the priests which he would not
to any other; secondly, that he granted the favour without delay,
and quelled his resentment. But that you may more clearly
understand the magnanimity of the Emperor, and the wisdom of the
priest, and more than both these, the lovingkindness of God; allow
me to relate to you a few particulars of the conference which took
place. But what I am now about to relate I learnt from one of those
who were within the palace; for the Father has told us neither much
nor little on the affair; but ever imitating the magnanimity of
Paul, he hides his own good deeds; and to those who on all sides
were asking him questions as to what he said to the Emperor; and
how he prevailed upon him; and how he turned away his wrath
entirely, he replied, “We contributed nothing to the matter, but
the Emperor himself (God having softened his heart), even before we
had spoken, dismissed his anger, and quelled his resentment; and
discoursing of the events that had taken place as if some other
person had been insulted, he thus went over all the events that had
happened without anger.” But those things which he concealed from
humility, God hath brought to light.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xxiii-p12">6. And what were these? I will proceed to relate
them to you by going a little farther back in the story. When he
went forth from the city, leaving all in such great despondency, he
endured what was far more grievous than we ourselves suffered, who
were in the midst of these calamities. For, in the first place,
meeting in the midst of his journey with those who had been sent by
the Emperor to make inquisition upon the events which had happened;
and learning from them, on what terms they were sent; and
reflecting upon the dreadful events that were in store for the
city, the tumults, the confusion, the flight, the terror, the
agony, the perils, he wept a flood of tears, and his bowels were
rent with compassion; for with fathers, it is usual to grieve much
more, when they are not able to be present with their suffering
children; which was just what this most tender-hearted man now
endured; not only lamenting the calamities which were in reserve
for us, but that he was far away from us, whist we were enduring
them. But this was, however, for our safety. For as soon as he had
learned these things from them; more warmly did the fountain of his
tears then gush forth, and he betook himself to God with more
fervent supplication; and spent his nights without sleep,
beseeching Him that He would succour the city, while enduring these
things, and make the mind of the Emperor more placable. And as soon
as he came to that great city, 
<pb n="484" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_484.html" id="xix.xxiii-Page_484" />and had entered the royal palace, he stood
before the Emperor at a distance,—speechless,—weeping,—with
downcast eyes,—covering his face as if he himself had been the
doer of all the mischief; and this he did, wishing first to incline
him to mercy by his posture, and aspect, and tears; and then to
begin an apology on our behalf; since there is but one hope of
pardon for those who have offended, which is to be silent, and to
utter nothing in defence of what has been done. For he was desirous
that one feeling should be got rid of, and that another should take
its place; that anger should be expelled, and sadness introduced,<note place="end" n="1853" id="xix.xxiii-p12.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxiii-p13"> ‡θυμίαν here opposed to 
θυμὸν and meaning especially such sadness as represses
violent emotion.</p></note> in order
that he might thus prepare the way for the words of his apology;
which indeed actually took place. And just as Moses going up to the
mount, when the people had offended, stood speechless himself,
until God called him, saying, “Let me alone, and I will blot out
this people;”<note place="end" n="1854" id="xix.xxiii-p13.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxiii-p14"> <scripRef passage="Exod. xxxii. 10" id="xix.xxiii-p14.1" parsed="|Exod|32|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Exod.32.10">Exod.
xxxii. 10</scripRef>.</p></note> so also
did he now act: The Emperor therefore, when he saw him shedding
tears, and bending toward the ground, himself drew near; and what
he really felt on seeing the tears of the priest, he made evident
by the words he addressed to him; for they were not those of a
person provoked or inflamed, but of one in sorrow; not of one
enraged, but rather dejected, and under constraint of extreme
pain.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xxiii-p15">7. And that this is true, ye will understand
when ye hear what were his words. For he did not say, “What does
this mean? Hast thou come heading an embassy on behalf of impious
and abominable men, such as ought not even to live; on behalf of
rebels,<note place="end" n="1855" id="xix.xxiii-p15.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxiii-p16"> τυρ€ννων.</p></note> of
revolutionists, who deserve the utmost punishment?” But
dismissing all words of that sort, he composed a defence of himself
full of respectfulness and dignity; and he enumerated the benefits,
which during the whole time of his reign he had conferred upon the
city; and at each of these he said, “Was it thus I should have
been treated in return for these things? What injuries had I done,
that they should take such revenge? What complaint had they, great
or small, that they must not insult me only, but the deceased
also?<note place="end" n="1856" id="xix.xxiii-p16.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxiii-p17"> St. Chrysostom here alludes to the pulling down
the statues of his wife and mother, which, together with his own
and those of his two sons, were dragged about the streets of
Antioch during the riot.</p></note> Was it not
sufficient to wreak their resentment against the living? Yet they
thought they were doing nothing grand, unless they insulted those
now in their graves. Granting that I had injured them, as they
suppose; surely it would have been becoming to spare the dead, who
had done them no wrong; for they could not have the same complaint
against them. Did I not ever esteem this city above every thing,
and account it as dearer than my native place? And was it not a
matter of my continual prayers to visit this city; and did I not
make this my oath<note place="end" n="1857" id="xix.xxiii-p17.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxiii-p18"> He seems to mean some such expression as “so may
I live to see Antioch.”</p></note> to all men?”</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xxiii-p19">8. Upon this, the priest sobbing bitterly, and
shedding warmer tears, no longer kept silence: for he saw that the
defence of the Emperor was raising our crime to a still higher
amount; but heaving from the bottom of his heart<note place="end" n="1858" id="xix.xxiii-p19.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxiii-p20"> κ€τωθεν.</p></note> a deep and bitter sigh, he said,
“We must confess, O Emperor, this love which you have shewn
towards our country! We cannot deny it! On this account,
especially, we mourn, that a city thus beloved has been bewitched
by demons; and that we should have appeared ungrateful towards her
benefactor, and have provoked her ardent lover. And although you
were to overthrow; although you were to burn; although you were to
put to death; or whatever else you might do, you would never yet
have taken on us the revenge we deserve. We ourselves have, by
anticipation, inflicted on ourselves what is worse than a thousand
deaths! For what can be more bitter, than when we are found to have
unjustly provoked our benefactor, and one who loved us so much, and
the whole world knows it, and condemns us for the most monstrous
ingratitude! If Barbarians had made an incursion on our city,<note place="end" n="1859" id="xix.xxiii-p20.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxiii-p21"> A kind of event then becoming familiar to the
Roman world.</p></note> and razed
its walls, and burnt its houses, and had taken and carried us away
captive, the evil had been less. And why so? but because, whilst
you live, and continue such a generous kindness towards us, there
might be a hope that we might again be brought back to our former
condition, and regain a more illustrious liberty. But now, having
been deprived of your favour, and having quenched your love, which
was a greater security to us than any wall, whom have we left to
fly to? Where else shall we have to look, when we have provoked so
benign a lord, so indulgent a father? So that while they seem to
have committed offences of the most intolerable kind, they have on
the other hand suffered the most terrible evils; not daring to look
any man in the face; nor being able to look upon the sun with free
eyes; shame everywhere weighing down their eyelids, and compelling
them to hide their heads! Deprived of their confidence, they are
now in a more <pb n="485" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_485.html" id="xix.xxiii-Page_485" />miserable
condition than any captives, and undergo the utmost dishonour; and
whilst thinking of the magnitude of their evils, and the height of
insolence to which they have rushed, they can scarce draw breath;
inasmuch as they have drawn on their own heads severer reproaches
from all the inhabitants of the world, than even from him who is
seen to have been insulted.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xxiii-p22">9. But yet, O Emperor, if you are willing, there is
a remedy for the wound, and a medicine for these evils, mighty as
they are! Often, indeed, has it occurred amongst private
individuals, that great and insufferable offences have become a
foundation for great affection. Thus also did it happen in the case
of our human race. For when God made man, and placed him in
Paradise, and held him in much honour; the devil could not bear
this his great prosperity, and envied him, and cast him out from
that dignity which had been granted. But God was so far from
forsaking him, that He even opened Heaven to us instead of
Paradise; and in so doing, both shewed His own lovingkindness, and
punished the devil the more severely. So do thou too now! The
demons have lately used all their efforts, that they may
effectually rend from your favour that city which was dearest of
all to you. Knowing this then, demand what penalty you will, but
let us not become outcasts from your former love! Nay, though it is
a strange thing, I must say, display towards us now still greater
kindness than ever; and again write this city’s name among the
foremost in your love;—if you are indeed desirous of being
revenged upon the demons who were the instigators of these crimes!
For if you pull down, and overturn, and raze the city, you will be
doing those very things which they have long been desiring. But if
you dismiss your anger, and again avow that you love it even as you
did before, you have given them a deadly blow. You have taken the
most perfect revenge upon them by shewing, not only that nothing
whatever has come for them of their evil designs; but that all hath
proved the very opposite of what they wished. And you would be just
in acting thus, and in shewing mercy to a city, which the demons
envied on account of your affection; for if you had not so
exceedingly loved her, they would not have envied her to such a
degree! So that even if what I have asserted is extraordinary, it
is nevertheless, true, that what the city hath suffered, hath been
owing to thee, and thy love! What burning, what devastation, so
bitter as those words, which you uttered in your own defence?</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xxiii-p23">10. You say now, that you have been insulted,
and sustained wrongs such as no Emperor ever yet did. But if you
will, O most gracious, most wise, and most religious Sovereign,
this contempt will procure you a crown, more honourable and
splendid than the diadem you wear! For this diadem is a display of
your princely virtue, but it is also a token of the munificence of
him who gave it; but the crown woven from this your humanity will
be entirely your own good work, and that of your own love of
wisdom; and all men will admire you less for the sake of these
precious stones,<note place="end" n="1860" id="xix.xxiii-p23.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxiii-p24"> It is here evidently supposed that the Emperor
appeared with the crown actually upon his head. The magnificence of
the Emperor’s appearance is dwelt upon at length by Chrysostom in
other Homilies, though with different feelings from what Gibbon
would insinuate. See c. xxxii. where he quotes the Homily on
Perfect Charity (6). Also on <scripRef passage="Eph. iv. 1" id="xix.xxiii-p24.1" parsed="|Eph|4|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Eph.4.1">Eph. iv. 1</scripRef>, Hom. IX.</p></note> than they will applaud you for
your superiority over this wrath. Were your Statues thrown down?
You have it in your power again to set up others yet more splendid.
For if you remit the offences of those who have done you injury,
and take no revenge upon them, they will erect a statue to you, not
one in the forum of brass, nor of gold, nor inlaid with gems; but
one arrayed in that robe which is more precious than any material,
that of humanity and tender mercy! Every man will thus set you up
in his own soul; and you will have as many statues, as there are
men who now inhabit, or shall hereafter inhabit, the whole world!
For not only we, but all those who come after us, and their
successors, will hear of these things, and will admire and love
you, just as if they themselves had experienced this
kindness!</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xxiii-p25">11. And to shew that I do not speak this in a way of
flattery, but that it will certainly be so, I will relate to you an
ancient piece of history, that you may understand that no armies,
nor warlike weapons, nor money, nor multitude of subjects, nor any
other such things are wont to make sovereigns so illustrious, as
wisdom of soul and gentleness. It is related of the blessed
Constantine, that on one occasion, when a statue of himself had
been pelted with stones, and many were instigating him to proceed
against the perpetrators of the outrage; saying, that they had
disfigured his whole face by battering it with stones, he stroked
his face with his hand, and smiling gently, said, “I am quite
unable to perceive any wound inflicted upon my face. The head
appears sound, and the face also quite sound.” Thus these
persons, overwhelmed with shame, desisted from their unrighteous
counsel.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xxiii-p26">This saying, even to the present day, all repeat;
and length of time hath neither 
<pb n="486" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_486.html" id="xix.xxiii-Page_486" />weakened nor extinguished the memory of such
exalted wisdom. How much more illustrious is such an action, than
any number of warlike trophies! Many and great titles did he build,
and many barbarous tribes did he conquer; not one of which we now
remember; but this saying is repeated over and over again, to the
present day; and those who follow us, as well as those who come
after them, will all hear of it. Nor indeed is this the only
admirable thing; that they will hear of it; but that when men speak
of it, they do so with approbation and applause; and those who hear
of it, receive it with the like; and there is no one who, when he
has heard it, is able to remain silent, but each at once cries out,
and applauds the man who uttered it, and prays that innumerable
blessings may be his lot even now deceased. But if amongst men,
this saying has gained him so much honour, how many crowns will he
obtain with the merciful God!</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xxiii-p27">12. And why need I speak of Constantine, and other
men’s examples, when it were fitting that I should exhort you by
considerations nearer home, and drawn from your own praiseworthy
actions. You remember how but lately, when this feast was near at
hand, you sent an epistle to every part of the world giving orders
that the inmates of the prisons should be set free, and their
crimes be pardoned. And as if this were not sufficient to give
proof of your generosity, you said in your letters, “O that it
were possible for me to recal and to restore those who are dead,
and to bring them back to their former state of life!” Remember
now these words. Behold the season of recalling and restoring the
deceased, and bringing them back to former life! For these are
indeed already dead, even before the sentence hath been pronounced;
and the city hath now taken up its tabernacle at the very gates of
Hades! Therefore raise it up again, which you can do without money,
without expense, without loss of time or labour! It is sufficient
merely for you to open your lips, and you will restore to life the
city which at present lieth in darkness. Grant now, that henceforth
it may bear an appellation derived from your philanthropy; for it
will not be so much indebted to the kindness of him who first
founded it, as it will be to your sentence. And this is exceedingly
reasonable; for he but gave it its beginning, and departed; but
you, when it had grown up and become great; and when it was fallen,
after all that great prosperity; will have been its restorer. There
would have been nothing so wonderful in your having delivered it
from danger, when enemies had captured, and barbarians overrun it,
as in your now sparing it. That, many of the Emperors have
frequently done; but should you alone accomplish this, you will be
first in doing it, and that beyond all expectation. And the former
of these good deeds, the protection of your subjects, is not at all
wonderful or extraordinary; but is one of those events which are of
continual occurrence; but the latter, the dismissal of wrath after
the endurance of such provocations, is something which surpasses
human nature.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xxiii-p28">13. Reflect, that the matter now for your
consideration is not respecting this city only, but is one that
concerns your own glory; or rather, one that affects the cause of
Christianity in general. Even now the Gentiles, and Jews, and the
whole empire as well as the barbarians, (for these last have also
heard of these events,) are eagerly looking to you, and waiting to
see what sentence you will pronounce with regard to these
transactions. And should you decree a humane and merciful one; all
will applaud the decision, and glorify God, and say one to another,
“Heavens! how great is the power of Christianity, that it
restrains and bridles a man who has no equal upon earth; a
sovereign, powerful enough to destroy and devastate all things; and
teaches him to practice such philosophy as one in a private station
had not been likely to display! Great indeed must be the God of the
Christians, who makes angels out of men, and renders them superior
to all the constraining force of our nature!”</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xxiii-p29">14. Nor ought you, assuredly, to entertain that idle
fear; nor to bear with those who say that other cites will become
worse, and grow more contemptuous of authority, if this city goes
unpunished. For if you were unable to take vengeance; and they,
after doing these things, had forcibly defied you; and the power on
each side was equally matched; then reasonably enough might such
suspicions be entertained. But if, terrified and half dead with
fear, they run to cast themselves at your feet, through me; and
expect daily nothing else but the pit of slaughter, and are engaged
in common supplications; looking up to heaven and calling upon God
to come to their aid, and to favour this our embassy; and have each
given charge about his private affairs, as if they were at their
last gasp; how can such a fear be otherwise than superfluous? If
they had been ordered to be put to death, they would not have
suffered as much as they do now, living as they have done so many
days in fear and trembling; and when the evening approaches, not
expecting to behold the morning; nor when the day arrives, hop<pb n="487" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_487.html" id="xix.xxiii-Page_487" />ing to reach the evening! Many
too have fallen in with wild beasts, while pursuing their way
through desert places, and removing to untrodden spots; and not men
only, but also little children and women; free born, and of good
condition; hiding themselves many days and nights in caves, and
ravines, and holes of the desert! A new mode of captivity hath
indeed befallen the city. Whilst the buildings and walls are
standing, they suffer heavier calamities than when cities have been
set on fire! Whilst no barbarian foe is present, whilst no enemy
appears, they are more wretchedly situated than if actually taken;
and the rustling only of a leaf scares them all every day! And
these are matters which are universally known; so that if all men
had seen the city razed to the ground, they would not have been
taught such a lesson of sobriety, as by hearing of the calamities
which have now befallen it. Suppose not, therefore, that other
cities will be made worse in future! Not even if you had overturned
other cities, would you have so effectually corrected them, as now,
by this suspense concerning their fate, having chastised<note place="end" n="1861" id="xix.xxiii-p29.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxiii-p30"> αὐτοὺς, “the
Antiochenes.” Some read αὐτὰς, “the
cities,” which does not make so good sense.</p></note> them more
severely than by any punishment!</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xxiii-p31">15. Do not, then, carry this calamity any farther;
but allow them henceforth to take breath again. For to punish the
guilty, and to exact the penalty for these deeds, were easy and
open to any one; but to spare those who have insulted you, and to
pardon those who have committed offences undeserving of pardon, is
an act of which only some one or two are capable; and especially
so, where the person treated with indignity is the Emperor. It is
an easy matter to place the city under the subjection of fear; but
to dispose all to be loving subjects; and to persuade them to hold
themselves well affected towards your government; and to offer not
only their common, but individual prayers for your empire; is a
work of difficulty. A monarch might expend his treasures, or put
innumerable troops in motion, or do what else he pleased, but still
he would not be able to draw the affections of so many men towards
himself as may now very easily be done. For they who have been
kindly dealt with, and those who hear of it too, will be well
affected towards you, even as the recipients of the benefit. How
much money, how many labours would you not have expended to win
over to yourself the whole world in a short space of time; and to
be able to persuade all those men who are now in existence, as well
as all future generations, to invoke upon your head the same
blessings which they pray for on behalf of their own children! And
if you will receive such a reward from men, how much greater will
you have from God! And this, not merely from the events which are
now taking place, but from those good deeds which shall be
performed by others in time to come. For if ever it should be that
an event similar to what has now occurred should take place, (which
God forbid!) and any of those who have been treated with indignity,
should then be consulting about prosecuting measures against the
rioters; your gentleness and moral wisdom will serve them instead
of all other teaching and admonition; and they will blush and be
ashamed, having such an example of wisdom, to appear inferior. So
that in this way you will be an instructor to all posterity; and
you will obtain the palm amongst them, even although they should
attain to the highest point of moral wisdom! For it is not the same
thing for a person to set the first example of such meekness
himself and by looking at others, to imitate the good actions they
have performed. On this account, whatever philanthropy, or
meekness, those who come after you may display, you will enjoy the
reward along with them; for he who provides the root, must be
considered the source of the fruits. For this reason, no one can
possibly now share with you the reward that will follow your
generosity, since the good deed hath been entirely your own. But
you will share the reward of all those who shall come after, if any
such persons should make their appearance; and it will be in your
power to have an equal share in the merit of the good work along
with them, and to carry off a portion as great as teachers have
with scholars. And supposing that no such person should come into
being, the tribute of commendation and applause will be
accumulating to you throughout every age.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xxiii-p32">16. For consider, what it is for all posterity to
hear it reported, that when so great a city had become obnoxious to
punishment and vengeance, that when all were terrified, when its
generals, its magistrates and judges, were all in horror and alarm,
and did not dare to utter a word on behalf of the wretched people;
a single old man, invested with the priesthood of God, came and
moved the heart of the Monarch by his mere aspect and intercourse;
and that the favour which he bestowed upon no other of his
subjects, he granted to this one old man, being actuated by a
reverence for God’s laws! For in this very thing, O Emperor, that
I have been sent hither on this embassy, the city hath done you no
small honour; for they have thus 
<pb n="488" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_488.html" id="xix.xxiii-Page_488" />pronounced the best and the most honourable
judgment on you, which is, that you respect the priests of God,
however insignificant they may be, more than any office placed
under your authority!</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xxiii-p33">17. But at the present time I have come not
from these only, but rather from One who is the common Lord of
angels and men, to address these words to your most merciful and
most gentle soul, “if ye forgive men their debts, your heavenly
Father will forgive you your trespasses.”<note place="end" n="1862" id="xix.xxiii-p33.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxiii-p34"> <scripRef passage="Matt. vi. 12" id="xix.xxiii-p34.1" parsed="|Matt|6|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.6.12">Matt. vi.

that without difficulty and without toil. Some when they go on an
embassy, bring gold, and silver, and other gifts of that kind. But
I am come into your royal presence with the sacred laws; and
instead of all other gifts, I present these; and I exhort you to
imitate your Lord, who whilst He is daily insulted by us,
unceasingly ministers His blessings to all! And do not confound our
hopes, nor defeat our promises.<note place="end" n="1864" id="xix.xxiii-p35.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxiii-p36"> Perhaps referring to promises the bishop had made

understand, that if it be your resolution to be reconciled, and to
restore your former kindness to the city, and to remit this just
displeasure, I shall go back with great confidence. But if you
determine to cast off the city, I shall not only never return to
it, nor see its soil again, but I shall in future utterly disown
it, and enrol myself a member of some other city; for God forbid
that I should ever belong to that country, which you, the most mild
and merciful of all men, refuse to admit to peace and
reconciliation!</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xxiii-p37">18. Having said this, and much more to the
same effect, he so overcame the Emperor, that the same thing
occurred which once happened to Joseph. For just as he, when he
beheld his brethren, longed to shed tears, but restrained his
feeling, in order that he might not spoil the part which he was
playing;<note place="end" n="1865" id="xix.xxiii-p37.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxiii-p38"> τὴν ὑπόκρισιν,
<i>i.e</i>., his counterfeited ignorance of his
brethren.</p></note> even so
did the Emperor mentally weep, but did not let it be seen, for the
sake of those who were present. He was not, however, able to
conceal the feeling at the close of the conference; but betrayed
himself, though against his will. For after this speech was
finished, no further words were necessary, but he gave utterance to
one only sentiment, which did him much more honour than the diadem.
And what was that? “How, said he, “can it be any thing
wonderful or great, that we should remit our anger against those
who have treated us with indignity; we, who ourselves are but men;
when the Lord of the universe, having come as He did on earth, and
having been made a servant for us, and crucified by those who had
experienced His kindness, besought the Father on behalf of His
crucifiers, saying, “Forgive them, for they know not what they
do?”<note place="end" n="1866" id="xix.xxiii-p38.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxiii-p39"> <scripRef passage="Luke xxiii. 34" id="xix.xxiii-p39.1" parsed="|Luke|23|34|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.23.34">Luke
xxiii. 34</scripRef>.</p></note> What
marvel, then, if we also should forgive our fellow-servants! And
that these words were not a pretence was proved by all that
followed. And not the least, that particular circumstance which I
am now about to mention; for this our priest, when he would have
remained there, and celebrated the feast together with himself, he
urged, though contrary to what he would have wished,—to use all
speed, and diligence, to present himself to his fellow-citizens.
“I know,” said he, “that their souls are still agitated; and
that there are many relics of the calamity left. Go, give them
consolation! If they see the helmsman, they will no longer remember
the storm that has passed away; but all recollection of these
sorrowful events will be effaced!” And when the Priest was
urgent, entreating him to send his own son, he, wishing to give the
most satisfactory proof of his having entirely blotted out from his
soul every wrathful feeling, answered; “Pray that these
hindrances may be taken out of the way; that these wars may be put
an end to;<note place="end" n="1867" id="xix.xxiii-p39.2"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxiii-p40"> The allusion is to the war with Maximus, who had
been acknowledged Emperor of Spain, Gaul and Britain, but was now
trying to wrest Italy from the rule of Valentinian II.</p></note> and then I
will certainly come myself.”</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xxiii-p41">19. What could be gentler than such a soul?
Let the Gentiles henceforward be ashamed; or rather, instead of
being ashamed, let them be instructed; and leaving their native
error, let them come back<note place="end" n="1868" id="xix.xxiii-p41.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxiii-p42"> As being God’s creatures, and having departed
from Him.</p></note> to the strength of Christianity,
having learned what our philosophy is, from the example of the
Emperor and of the Priest! For our most pious Emperor stayed not at
this point; but when the Bishop had left the city, and come over
the sea, he dispatched thither also certain persons, being most
solicitous and painstaking to prevent any waste of time lest the
city should be thus deprived of half its pleasure, whilst the
bishop was celebrating the feast beyond its walls. Where is the
gracious father that would have so busied himself on behalf of
those who had insulted him? But I must mention another
circum<pb n="489" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf109/Page_489.html" id="xix.xxiii-Page_489" />stance that
redounds to the praise of the just man.<note place="end" n="1869" id="xix.xxiii-p42.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxiii-p43"> The bishop.</p></note> For when he had accomplished this,
he did not make it his endeavour, as any one else might have done,
who was fond of glory, to deliver those letters himself, which were
to set us free from the state of dejection in which we were; but
since he was journeying at too slow a rate for this, he thought
proper to send forward another person in his stead; one among those
who were skilled in horsemanship, to be the bearer of the good news
to the city;<note place="end" n="1870" id="xix.xxiii-p43.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxiii-p44"> Comp. what is said of Cæsarius, Lib.
Reiske. t. i. p. 691. This may relate to a different occasion, as
it seems likely that there were two rescripts, the second of which
conveyed the <i>full</i> pardon.</p></note> lest its
sadness should be prolonged by the tardiness of his arrival. For
the only thing he earnestly coveted was this; not that he might
come himself, bringing these favourable tidings, so full of all
that is delightful, but that our country might as soon as possible
breathe freely again.</p>

<p class="c10" id="xix.xxiii-p45">20. What therefore ye then did, in decking the
forum with garlands; lighting lamps, spreading couches<note place="end" n="1871" id="xix.xxiii-p45.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxiii-p46"> στιβ€δας. Cave,
in his life of St. Chrysostom, has rendered it, “the doors and
shop windows set off with flowers and green branches;” but this
seems purely fanciful; the word <i>stibadium</i> among the Romans
meant a couch of particular construction, which allowed seven or
eight to recline upon it at supper. These were probably temporary
couches, made of, or strewed with, green leaves, for a public
feast. (Libanius mentions this feasting, and praises the sympathy
and good nature of Hellebichus on the occasion. His mention of a
<i>fish</i> may be connected with the fast. <i>Or. ad Helleb.
fin</i>.)</p></note> of green
leaves before the shops, and keeping high festival, as if the city
had just come into being, this do ye, although in another manner,
throughout all time;—being crowned, not with flowers, but with
virtue;—kindling in your souls the light which comes from good
works; rejoicing with a spiritual gladness. And let us never fail
to give God thanks continually for all these things, not only that
he hath freed us from these calamities, but that he also permitted
them to happen; and let us acknowledge his abundant goodness! for
by both these has He adorned our city.<note place="end" n="1872" id="xix.xxiii-p46.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxiii-p47"> <i>i.e</i>., both by sending the calamity and by
delivering from it.</p></note> Now all these things according to
the prophetic saying, “Declare ye to your children; and let your
children tell their children; and their children again another
generation.”<note place="end" n="1873" id="xix.xxiii-p47.1"><p class="endnote" id="xix.xxiii-p48"> <scripRef passage="Joel i. 3" id="xix.xxiii-p48.1" parsed="|Joel|1|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Joel.1.3">Joel i.
3</scripRef>.</p></note> So that
all who shall be hereafter, even to the consummation, learning this
act of God’s lovingkindness towards the city, may call us
blessed, in having enjoyed such a favour;—may marvel at our
Sovereign, who raised up the city when it was so grievously
falling;—and may themselves be profited, being stimulated to
piety by means of all which has happened! For the history of what
has lately happened to us, will have power to profit not only
ourselves, if we constantly remember it, but also those who shall
come after us. All these things then being considered, let us
always give thanks to God who loveth man; not merely for our
deliverance from these fearful evils, but for their being permitted
to overtake us,—learning this from the divine Scriptures, as well
as from the late events that have befallen us; that He ever
disposes all things for our advantage, with that lovingkindness
which is His attribute, which God grant, that we may continually
enjoy, and so may obtain the kingdom of heaven, in Christ Jesus our
Lord; to whom be glory and dominion for ever and ever.
Amen.</p>
