  <description>With over twenty volumes, the <i>Nicene and 
Post-Nicene Fathers</i> is a momentous achievement. Originally gathered 
by 
Philip Schaff, the <i>Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers</i> is a collection 
of 
writings by classical and medieval Christian theologians. The purpose of 
such a collection is to make their writings readily available. The 
entire work is divided into two series. The first series focuses on two 
classical Christian theologians--St. Augustine and St. John Chrysostom. 
St. Augustine is one of the most influential and important Christian 
thinkers of all time. In addition to reprinting his most popular two 
works--the <i>Confessions</i> and the <i>City of God</i>--these volumes 
also 
contain 
other noteworthy and important works of St. Augustine, such as <i>On the 
Holy Trinity</i>, <i>Christian Doctrine</i>, and others. St. John 
Chrysostom 
was 
an 
eloquent speaker and well-loved Christian clergyman. St. John took a 
more literal interpretation of Scripture, and much of his work focused 
on practical aspects of Christianity, particularly what is now called 
social justice. He advocated for the poor, and challenged abuses of 
authority. This volume contains St. John Chrysostom's homilies on first 
and second <i>Corinthians</i>. The <i>Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers</i> 
is 
comprehensive in scope, and provide keen translations of instructive and 
illuminating texts from some of the greatest theologians of the 
Christian church. These spiritually enlightening texts have aided 
Christians for over a thousand years, and remain instructive and 
fruitful even today!<br /><br />Tim Perrine<br />CCEL Staff Writer

<p class="c2" id="iii-p2">————————————</p>

<p class="c19" id="iii-p3"><span class="c18" id="iii-p3.1">The</span> British edition of this
translation has a preface in which is given a short “sketch” of
Chrysostom’s history. As a fuller outline has been given in the
course of the present reproduction of the homilies, it is
considered advisable to omit this sketch here. (See Vol. ix. pp.
3–23.) The remainder of the English editor’s preface is as
follows:</p>

<p class="c19" id="iii-p4">“The history and remains of St. Chrysostom are in
one respect more interesting perhaps to the modern reader, than
most of the monuments of those who are technically called the
Fathers. At the time when he was raised up, and in those parts of
the Christian world to which he was sent, the Patriarchates,
namely, of Antioch and Constantinople, the Church was neither
agitated by persecution from without, nor by any particular
doctrinal controversy within, sufficient to attract his main
attention, and connect his name with its history, as the name of
St. Athanasius, e.g., is connected with the Arian, or that of St.
Augustine with the Pelagian, controversy. The labours of St.
Athanasius and St. Basil, and their friends and disciples, had come
to a happy issue at the second Œcumenical Council; the civil power
favoured orthodox doctrine, and upheld Episcopal authority. The
Church seemed for the time free to try the force of her morals and
discipline against the ordinary vices and errors of all ages and
all nations. This is one reason why the Homilies of St.
Chrysostom have always been considered as eminently likely among
the relics of Antiquity, to be useful as models for preaching, and
as containing hints for the application of Scripture to common
life, and the consciences of persons around us.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iii-p5">Another reason undoubtedly is the remarkable energy
and fruitfulness of the writer’s mind, that command of language
and of topics, and above all, that depth of charitable and
religious feeling, which enabled him, to a very remarkable extent,
to carry his hearers along with him, even when the things he
recommended were most distasteful to their natures and
prejudices. It is obvious how much of the expression of this
quality must vanish in translation: the elegance and fluency of
his Greek style, the flow of his periods, the quickness and
ingenuity of his turns, all the excellencies to which more
especially his surname was owing, must in the nature of things be
sacrificed, except in case of very rare felicity, on passing into a
modern language. His dramatic manner indeed, which was one of the
great charms of his oratory among the Greeks, and his rapid and
ingenious selection and variation of topics, these may in some
measure be retained, and may serve to give even English readers
some faint notion of the eloquence which produced so powerful
effects on the susceptible people of the East.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iii-p6">“However, it is not of course as composition that
we desire to call attention to these or any other of the remains of
the Fathers. Nor would this topic have been so expressly adverted
to, but for the two following reasons. First, it is in such
particulars as these, that the parallel mainly subsists, which has
more than once been observed, between St. Chrysostom and our own
<pb n="iv" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_iv.html" id="iii-Page_iv" />Bishop Taylor: and it is good
for the Church in general, and encouraging for our own Church in
particular, to notice such providential revivals of ancient graces
in modern times.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iii-p7">“Again, this profusion of literary talent, and
eloquency and vehemence and skill in moral teaching, is of itself,
as human nature now exists, a matter of much jealousy to
considerate persons, found answerable to the profession implied in
their works. And therefore it was desirable to dwell on it in
this instance, for the purpose of pointing out afterwards how
completely his life gave evidence that he meant and practiced what
he taught.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iii-p8">“The Homilies on the first Epistle to the
Corinthians have ever been considered by learned and devout men as
among the most perfect specimens of his mind and teaching. They
are of that mixed form, between exposition and exhortation, which
serves perhaps better than any other, first, to secure attention,
and then to convey to an attentive hearer the full purport of the
holy words as they stand in the Bible, and to communicate to him
the very impression which the preacher himself had received from
the text. Accordingly they come in not unfitly in this series, by
way of specimen of the hortatory Sermons of the ancients, as St.
Cyril’s, of their Catechetical Lectures, and St. Cyprians, the
Pastoral Letters, which were circulated among them.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iii-p9">“The date of these Homilies is not exactly
known: but it is certain that they were delivered at Antioch,
were it only from Hom. xxi. §. 9. ad fin. Antioch was at that
time, in a temporal sense, a flourishing Church, maintaining 3,000
widows and virgins,<note place="end" n="1" id="iii-p9.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii-p10">
Hom. 66. on St. Matt. t. ii. p. 422. ed. Savil.</p></note> maimed persons,
prisoners, and ministers of the altar; although, St. Chrysostom
adds, its income was but that of one of the lowest class of wealthy
individuals. It was indeed in a state of division, on account of
the disputed succession in the Episcopate between the followers of
Paulinus and Meletius since the year 362: but this separation
affected not immediately any point of doctrine; and was in a way to
be gradually worn out, partly by the labors of St. Chrysostom
himself, whose discourse concerning the Anathema seems to have been
occasioned by the too severe way in which the partisans on both
sides allowed themselves to speak of each other. It may be that
he had an eye to this schism in his way of handling those parts of
the Epistles to the Corinthians, which so earnestly deprecate the
spirit of schism and party, and the calling ourselves by human
names.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iii-p11">“The Text which has been used in this
translation is the Benedictine, corrected however in many places by
that of Savile. The Benedictine Sections are marked in the margin
thus, (2.) For the Translation, the Editors are indebted to the
Reverend <span class="c18" id="iii-p11.1">Hubert Kestell Cornish</span>, M.A.,
late Fellow of Exeter College, and to the Reverend <span class="c18" id="iii-p11.2">John Medley</span>, M.A., of Wadham College, Vicar of
St. Thomas, in the city of Exeter.”</p>

<p class="c20" id="iii-p12">J. K[eble].</p>

<p id="iii-p13"><br />
</p>

<p class="c19" id="iii-p14">The Homilies on the Second Epistle were issued four
years later than those on the First, and were preceded by the
following note:</p>

<p class="c19" id="iii-p15">“The present Volume completes the set of St.
Chrysostom’s Commentaries on the Epistles of St. Paul, with the
exception of that to the Hebrews, the Translation of which is
preparing for the press. The edition of the original by Mr. Field
has afforded the advantage of an improved text, in fact of one as
good as we can hope to see constructed from existing <span class="c18" id="iii-p15.1">mss.</span></p>

<p class="c19" id="iii-p16"><pb n="v" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_v.html" id="iii-Page_v" />“These
Homilies were delivered at Antioch in the opinion of the
Benedictine Editors, though Savile doubted it. The question
depends on the interpretation of a passage near the end of Hom.
xxvi., in which St. Chrysostom speaks of Constantinople, and
presently says ‘here.’ This, it has been rightly argued, he
might say in the sense of “in the place I am speaking of,’
while he was not likely to say, ‘in Constantinople’ if he were
speaking there.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iii-p17">“For the Translation the Editors are
indebted to the Rev. <span class="c18" id="iii-p17.1">J. Ashworth</span>, M.A., of
Brasenose College.”</p>

<p class="c21" id="iii-p18">S. Clement, 1848.</p>

<p class="c20" id="iii-p19"><span class="c18" id="iii-p19.1">C. M. M[arriott.]</span></p>

<p class="c22" id="iii-p20">This volume of the Nicene and Post-Nicene
Fathers, embraces both volumes of the original London issue, one of
which appeared in 1844, the other in 1848. The author of the
latter had, as appears from his statement above, the advantage of
using the recension of the Greek text which was prepared by the
late <span class="c18" id="iii-p20.1">Frederick Field</span>, M.A., LL.D., and
eminent textual critic whose labors leave nothing to be desired so
far as concerns the materials at his command. The translators of
the First Epistle did not have this advantage. Hence the present
editor has made a diligent comparison throughout their work with
Dr. <span class="c18" id="iii-p20.2">Field’s</span> text, and whenever it was
necessary has silently conformed the rendering to that text, in a
few instances omitting a note which made needless or inappropriate
by the change. In both Epistles he has occasionally amended the
translation to gain perspicuity and smoothness. The work of the
English authors has been performed with great care and fidelity,
and is literal almost to a fault, it apparently being their
endeavor to reproduce the form as well as the spirit of the
original. This has given to their pages a stiffness and
constraint not altogether agreeable, yet it is a compensation to
the reader to know that he has before him the precise thought of
the great pulpit orator of the Greek Church. The American
Editor’s notes have been enclosed in square brackets and marked
with his initial.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iii-p21">The English text of the Epistles has been sedulously
conformed to that of the Revised Edition of 1881, except in cases
in which the Greek text used by Chrysostom varied from that adopted
by recent Editors. All peculiarities of Chrysostom’s text have
been faithfully preserved.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iii-p22">In these days when expository preaching is so loudly
and generally demanded, it cannot but be of use to the rising
ministry to see how this service was performed by the most eloquent
and effective of the Fathers, John of the Golden-Mouth.</p>

<p class="c24" id="iv.i-p9">[1.] As Corinth is now the first city of
Greece, so of old it prided itself on many temporal advantages, and
more than all the rest, on excess of wealth. And on this account
one of the heathen writers entitled the place “the rich<note place="end" n="2" id="iv.i-p9.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i-p10">
Homer, <i>Il</i>. ii. 570; Thucyd. i. 13; Strabo, viii.
20.</p></note>.” For it lies on the isthmus of
the Peloponnesus, and had great facilities for traffic. The city
was also full of numerous orators, and philosophers, and one,<note place="end" n="3" id="iv.i-p10.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i-p11">
Periander; but vid. Plutarch. <i>in Solon</i>. tom. i. p.
185. ed. Bryan.</p></note> I think, of the seven called wise
men, was of this city. Now these things we have mentioned, not
for ostentation’s sake, nor to make, a display of great
learning: (for indeed what is there in knowing these things?) but
they are of use to us in the argument of the Epistle.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.i-p12">Paul also himself suffered many things in this city;
and Christ, too, in this city appears to him and says, (<scripRef passage="Acts xviii. 10" id="iv.i-p12.1" parsed="|Acts|18|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.18.10">Acts xviii. 10</scripRef>), “Be not silent, but speak;
for I have much people in this city:” and he remained there two
years. In this city [<scripRef passage="Acts xix. 16" id="iv.i-p12.2" parsed="|Acts|19|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.19.16">Acts xix. 16</scripRef>. Corinth put here, by lapse
of memory, for Ephesus.] also the devil went out, whom the Jews
endeavoring to exorcise, suffered so grievously. In this city did
those of the magicians, who repented, collect together their books
and burn them, and there appeared to be fifty thousand. (<scripRef passage="Acts xix. 18" id="iv.i-p12.3" parsed="|Acts|19|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.19.18">Acts xix. 18</scripRef>. <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.i-p12.4">ἀργυρίου</span>
omitted.) In this city also, in the time of Gallio the
Proconsul, Paul was beaten before the judgment seat.<note place="end" n="4" id="iv.i-p12.5"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i-p13">
This is said of Sosthenes, 
<scripRef passage="Acts xviii. 17" id="iv.i-p13.1" parsed="|Acts|18|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.18.17">Acts xviii. 17</scripRef>. But the context makes it
probable that St. Paul was beaten also. [Hardly.]</p></note></p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.i-p14">[2.] The devil, therefore, seeing that a
great and populous city had laid hold of the truth, a city admired
for wealth and wisdom, and the head of Greece; (for Athens and
Lacedæmon were then and since in a miserable state, the dominion
having long ago fallen away from them;) and seeing that with great
readiness they had received the word of God; what doth he? He
divides the men. For he knew that even the strongest kingdom of
all, divided against itself, shall not stand. He had a vantage
ground too, for this device in the wealth, the wisdom of the
inhabitants. Hence certain men, having made parties of their own,
and having become self-elected made themselves leaders of the
people, and some sided with these, and some with those; with one
sort, as being rich; with another, as wise and able to teach
something out of the common. Who on their part, receiving them,
set themselves up forsooth to teach more than the Apostle did:<note place="end" n="5" id="iv.i-p14.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i-p15">
St. Irenæus, <i>Adv. Hær</i>. iii. v. 1, points out this as
a main topic of heretical teaching. “These most futile of
Sophisters affirm that the Apostles taught feignedly, after the
capacity of the hearers, and gave answer after the prejudices of
those who enquired of them, discoursing with the blind blindly
according to their blindness, with the feeble according to their
feebleness, and with the erring according to their
error.”</p></note>  at which he was hinting, when he
said, “I was not able to speak unto you as unto spiritual”
(<scripRef passage="1 Cor. 3.1" id="iv.i-p15.1" parsed="|1Cor|3|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.3.1">ch. iii. 1</scripRef>.); evidently not his
inability, but their infirmity, was the cause of their not having
been abundantly instructed. And this, (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. 4.8" id="iv.i-p15.2" parsed="|1Cor|4|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.4.8">ch. iv.
8</scripRef>.) “Ye are become rich
without us,” is the remark of one pointing that way. And this
was no small matter, but of all things most pernicious; that the
Church should be torn asunder.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.i-p16"><pb n="2" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_2.html" id="iv.i-Page_2" />And another sin,
too, besides these, was openly committed there: namely, a person
who had had intercourse with his step-mother not only escaped
rebuke, but was even a leader of the multitude, and gave occasion
to his followers to be conceited. Wherefore he saith, (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. 5.2" id="iv.i-p16.1" parsed="|1Cor|5|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.5.2">ch. 5.
2</scripRef>.) “And ye are puffed
up, and have not rather mourned.” And after this again, certain
of those who as they pretended were of the more perfect sort, and
who for gluttony’s sake used to eat of things offered unto idols,
and sit at meat in the temples, were bringing all to ruin. Others
again, having contentions and strifes about money, committed unto
the heathen courts (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.i-p16.2">τοῖς 
ἔξωθεν σικαδτηρίοις</span>) all matters of that
kind. Many persons also wearing long hair used to go about among
them; whom he ordereth to be shorn. There was another fault
besides, no trifling one; their eating in the churches apart by
themselves, and giving no share to the needy.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.i-p17">And again, they were erring in another point, being
puffed up with the gifts; and hence jealous of one another; which
was also the chief cause of the distraction of the Church. The
doctrine of the Resurrection, too, was lame (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.i-p17.1">ἐχώλευε</span>)
among them: for some of them had no strong belief that there is
any resurrection of bodies, having still on them the disease of
Grecian foolishness. For indeed all these things were the progeny
of the madness which belongs to Heathen Philosophy, and she was the
mother of all mischief. Hence, likewise, they had become divided;
in this respect also having learned of the philosophers. For
these latter were no less at mutual variance, always, through love
of rule and vain glory contradicting one another’s opinions, and
bent upon making some new discovery in addition to all that was
before. And the cause of this was, their having begun to trust
themselves to reasonings.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.i-p18">[3.] They had written accordingly to him by the
hand of Fortunatus and Stephanas and Achaicus, by whom also he
himself writes; and this he has indicated in the end of the
Epistle: not however upon all these subjects, but about marriage
and virginity; wherefore also he said, (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. 7.1" id="iv.i-p18.1" parsed="|1Cor|7|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.7.1">ch. vii.
1</scripRef>.) “Now concerning the
things whereof ye wrote” &amp;c. And he proceeds to give
injunctions, both on the points about which they had written, and
those about which they had not written; having learnt with accuracy
all their failings. Timothy, too, he sends with the letters,
knowing that letters indeed have great force, yet that not a little
would be added to them by the presence of the disciple also.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.i-p19">Now whereas those who had divided the Church among
themselves, from a feeling of shame lest they should seem to have
done so for ambition’s sake, contrived cloaks for what had
happened, their teaching (forsooth) more perfect doctrines, and
being wiser than all others; Paul sets himself first against the
disease itself, plucking up the root of the evils, and its
offshoot, the spirit of separation. And he uses great boldness of
speech: for these were his own disciples, more than all others.
Wherefore he saith (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. 9.2" id="iv.i-p19.1" parsed="|1Cor|9|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.9.2">ch. ix. 2</scripRef>.) “If to others I be not an
Apostle, yet at least I am unto you; for the seal of my apostleship
are ye.” Moreover they were in a weaker condition (to say the
least of it) than the others. Wherefore he saith, (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. 3.1,2" id="iv.i-p19.2" parsed="|1Cor|3|1|3|2" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.3.1-1Cor.3.2">ch. iii.
1, 2</scripRef>. <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.i-p19.3">οὐδὲ</span> for <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.i-p19.4"> οὔτε</span>). “For I have not spoken unto you as unto
spiritual; for hitherto ye were not able, neither yet even now are
ye able.” (This he saith, that they might not suppose that he
speaks thus in regard of the time past alone.)</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.i-p20">However, it was utterly improbable that all
should have been corrupted; rather there were some among them who
were very holy. And this he signified<note place="end" n="6" id="iv.i-p20.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i-p21"> It
appears by the subsequent commentary on these verses, that S.
Chrysostom understood the Apostle to be alluding in them to persons
among the Corinthians, who had suffered from unjust censure and
party spirit. See Hom. ii. §. 1; xi. near the end; and the
opening of Hom. xii.</p></note> in the middle of the Epistle, where
he says, (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. 4.3,6" id="iv.i-p21.1" parsed="|1Cor|4|3|0|0;|1Cor|4|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.4.3 Bible:1Cor.4.6">ch. iv. 3, 6</scripRef>.) “To me it is a very small
thing that I should be judged of you:” and adds, “these
things I have in a figure transferred unto myself and
Apollos.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.i-p22">Since then from arrogance all these evils were
springing, and from men’s thinking that they knew something out
of the common, this he purgeth away first of all, and in beginning
saith,</p>

<p class="c27" id="iv.ii-p3">Paul, called to be an Apostle of Jesus Christ,
through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother, unto the Church
of God which is at Corinth, even them that are sanctified in Christ
Jesus, called to be Saints, with all that call upon the name of our
Lord Jesus Christ in every place, their Lord and ours: Grace unto
you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class="c24" id="iv.ii-p4">[1.] <span class="c18" id="iv.ii-p4.1">See</span> how
immediately, from the very beginning, he casts down their pride,
and dashes to the ground all their fond imagination, in that he
speaks of himself as “called.” For what I have learnt, saith
he, I discovered not myself, nor acquired by my own wisdom, but
while I was persecuting and laying waste the Church I was called.
Now here of Him that calleth is everything: of him that is
called, nothing, (so to speak,) but only to obey.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.ii-p5">“Of Jesus Christ.” Your teacher is Christ; and
do you register the names of men, as patrons of your doctrine?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.ii-p6">“Through the will of God.” For it was God who
willed that you should be saved in this way. We ourselves have
wrought no good thing, but by the will of God we have attained to
this salvation; and because it seemed good to him, we were called,
not because we were worthy.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.ii-p7">“And Sosthenes our brother.” Another instance
of his modesty; he puts in the same rank with himself one inferior
to Apollos; for great was the interval between Paul and
Sosthenes. Now if where the interval was so wide he stations with
himself one far beneath him, what can they have to say who despise
their equals?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.ii-p8">“Unto the Church of God.” Not “of this or of
that man,” but of God.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.ii-p9">“Which is at Corinth.” Seest thou how at each
word he puts down their swelling pride; training their thoughts in
every way for heaven? He calls it, too, the Church “of God;”
shewing that it ought to be united. For if it be “of God,” it
is united, and it is one, not in Corinth only, but also in all the
world: for the Church’s name (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.ii-p9.1">ἐκκλησία</span>: properly <i>an assembly</i>)
is not a name of separation, but of unity and concord.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.ii-p10">“To the sanctified in Christ Jesus.” Again the
name of Jesus; the names of men he findeth no place for. But what
is Sanctification? The Laver, the Purification. For he reminds
them of their own uncleanness, from which he had freed them; and so
persuades them to lowliness of mind; for not by their own good
deeds, but by the loving-kindness of God, had they been
sanctified.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.ii-p11">“Called to be Saints.” For even this, to be
saved by faith, is not saith he, of yourselves; for ye did not
first draw near, but were called; so that not even this small
matter is yours altogether. However, though you had drawn near,
accountable as you are for innumerable wickednesses, not even so
would the grace be yours, but God’s. Hence also, writing to the
Ephesians, he said, (<scripRef passage="Eph. ii. 8" id="iv.ii-p11.1" parsed="|Eph|2|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Eph.2.8">Eph.
ii. 8</scripRef>) “By grace have
ye been saved through faith, and this not of yourselves;” not
even the faith is yours altogether; for ye were not first with your
belief, but obeyed a call.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.ii-p12">“With all who call upon the Name of our Lord Jesus
Christ.” Not “of this or that man,” but “the Name of the
Lord.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.ii-p13">[2.] “In every place, both theirs and ours.”
For although the letter be written to the Corinthians only, yet he
makes mention of all the faithful that are in all the earth;
showing that the Church throughout the world must be one, however
separate in divers places; and much more, that in Corinth. And
though the place separate, the Lord binds them together, being
common to all. Wherefore also uniting them he adds, “both
theirs and ours.” And this is far more powerful [to unite],
than the other [to separate]. For as men in one place, having
many and contrary masters, become distracted, and their one place
helps them not to be of one mind, their masters giving orders at
variance with each other, and drawing each their own way, according
to what Christ says, (St. 
<scripRef passage="Matt. vi. 24" id="iv.ii-p13.1" parsed="|Matt|6|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.6.24">Matt. vi. 24</scripRef>) “Ye cannot serve God and
Mammon;” so those in different places, if they have not different
lords but one only, are not by the places injured in respect of
unanimity, the One Lord binding them together. “I say not then,
(so he speaks,) that with Corinthians only, you being Corinthians
ought to be of one mind, but with all that are in the whole world,
inasmuch as you have a common Master.” This is also why he hath
a second <pb n="4" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_4.html" id="iv.ii-Page_4" />time added “our;”
for since he had said, “the Name of Jesus Christ our Lord,”
lest he should appear to the inconsiderate to be making a
distinction, he subjoins again, “both our Lord and theirs.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.ii-p14">[3.] That my meaning may be clearer, I will read
it according to its sense thus: “Paul and Sosthenes to the
Church of God which is in Corinth and to all who call upon the Name
of Him who is both our Lord and theirs in every place, whether in
Rome or wheresoever else they may be: grace unto you and peace
from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.ii-p15">Or again thus; which I also believe to be rather
more correct: “Paul and Sosthenes to those that are at Corinth,
who have been sanctified, called to be Saints, together with all
who call upon the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ in place, both
theirs and ours;” that is to say, “grace unto you, and peace
unto you, who are at Corinth, who have been sanctified and
called;” not to you alone, but “with all who in every place
call upon the Name of Jesus Christ, our Lord and theirs.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.ii-p16">Now if our peace be of grace, why hast thou high
thoughts? Why art Thou so puffed up, being saved by grace? And
if thou hast peace with God, why wish to assign thyself to others?
since this is what separation comes to. For what if you be at
“peace” with this man, and with the other even find
“grace?” My prayer is that both these may be yours from God;
both from Him I say, and towards Him. For neither do they abide
(<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.ii-p16.1">μένει</span>, Savile in marg.) secure
except they enjoy the influence from above; nor unless God be their
object will they aught avail you: for it profiteth us nothing,
though we be peaceful towards all men, if we be at war with God;
even as it is no harm to us, although by all men we are held as
enemies, if with God we are at peace. And again it is no gain to
us, if all men approve, and the Lord be offended; neither is there
any danger, though all shun and hate us, if with God we have
acceptance and love. For that which is verily grace, and verily
peace, cometh of God, since he who finds grace in God’s sight,
though he suffer ten thousand horrors, feareth no one; I say not
only, no man, but not even the devil himself; but he that hath
offended God suspects all men, though he seem to be in security.
For human nature is unstable, and not friends only and brethren,
but fathers also, before now, have been altogether changed and
often for a little thing he whom they begat, the branch of their
planting, hath been to them, more than all foes, an object of
persecution. Children, too, have cast off their fathers. Thus,
if ye will mark it, David was in favor with God, Absalom was in
favor with men. What was the end of each, and which of them
gained most honor, ye know. Abraham was in favor with God,
Pharaoh with men; for to gratify him they gave up the just man’s
wife. (See St. Chrys. on <scripRef passage="Gen. xii. 17" id="iv.ii-p16.2" parsed="|Gen|12|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.12.17">Gen. xii. 17</scripRef>.) Which then of the two
was the more illustrious, and the happy man? every one knows. And
why speak I of righteous men; The Israelites were in favor with
God, but they were hated by men, the Egyptians; but nevertheless
they prevailed against their haters and vanquished them, with how
great triumph, is well known to you all.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.ii-p17">For this, therefore, let all of us labor earnestly;
whether one be a slave, let him pray for this, that he may find
grace with God rather than with his master; or a wife, let her seek
grace from God her Saviour rather than from her husband; or a
soldier, in preference to his king and commander let him seek that
favor which cometh from above. For thus among men also wilt thou
be an object of love.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.ii-p18">[4.] But how shall a man find grace with God? 
How else, except by lowliness of mind? “For God, “saith one,
(St. <scripRef passage="Jas. iv. 6" id="iv.ii-p18.1" parsed="|Jas|4|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Jas.4.6">Jas. iv. 6</scripRef>.) “resisteth the proud, but
giveth grace unto the humble; and, (<scripRef passage="Ps. li. 17" id="iv.ii-p18.2" parsed="|Ps|51|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.51.17">Ps. li. 17</scripRef>. <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.ii-p18.3"> τεταπεινωμένην</span>.) the sacrifice of God is a broken spirit,
and a heart that is brought low God will not despise.” For if
with men humility is so lovely, much more with God. Thus both
they of the Gentiles found grace and the Jews no other way fell
from grace; (<scripRef passage="Rom. x. 13" id="iv.ii-p18.4" parsed="|Rom|10|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.10.13">Rom. x.
13</scripRef>.) “for they were not
subject unto the righteousness of God.” The lowly man of whom I
am speaking, is pleasing and delightful to all men, and dwells in
continual peace, and hath in him no ground for contentions. For
though you insult him, though you abuse him, whatsoever you say, he
will be silent and will bear it meekly, and will have so great
peace towards all men as one cannot even describe. Yea, and with
God also. For the commandments of God are to be at peace with
men: and thus our whole life is made prosperous, through peace one
with another. For no man can injure God: His nature is
imperishable, and above all suffering. Nothing makes the
Christian so admirable as lowliness of mind. Hear, for instance,
Abraham saying, (<scripRef passage="Gen. xviii. 27" id="iv.ii-p18.5" parsed="|Gen|18|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.18.27">Gen.
xviii. 27</scripRef>.) “But I am
but dust and ashes;” and again, God [saying] of Moses, that
(<scripRef passage="Numb. xii. 3" id="iv.ii-p18.6" parsed="|Num|12|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Num.12.3">Numb. xii. 3</scripRef>.) “he was the meekest of all
men.” For nothing was ever more humble than he; who, being
leader of so great a people, and having overwhelmed in the sea the
king and the host of all the Egyptians, as if they had been flies;
and having wrought so many wonders both in Egypt and by the Red Sea
and in the wilderness, and received such high testimony, yet felt
exactly as if he had been an ordinary person, and as a son-in-law
was humbler than his father-in-law, (<scripRef passage="Exodus xviii. 24" id="iv.ii-p18.7" parsed="|Exod|18|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Exod.18.24">Exodus xviii. 24</scripRef>) and took 
<pb n="5" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_5.html" id="iv.ii-Page_5" />advice from him, and was not indignant, nor did
he say, “What is this? After such and so great achievements,
art thou come to us with thy counsel?” This is what most people
feel; though a man bring the best advice, despising it, because of
the lowliness of the person. But not so did he: rather through
lowliness of mind he wrought all things well. Hence also he
despised the courts of kings, (<scripRef passage="Heb. xi. 24-26" id="iv.ii-p18.8" parsed="|Heb|11|24|11|26" osisRef="Bible:Heb.11.24-Heb.11.26">Heb. xi. 24–26</scripRef>.) since he was lowly indeed: 
for the sound mind and the high spirit are the fruit of humility.
For of how great nobleness and magnanimity, thinkest thou, was it a
token, to despise the kingly palace and table? since kings among
the Egyptians are honored as gods, and enjoy wealth and treasures
inexhaustible. But nevertheless, letting go all these and
throwing away the very sceptres of Egypt, he hastened to join
himself unto captives, and men worn down with toil, whose strength
was spent in the clay and the making of bricks, men whom his own
slaves abhorred, (for, saith he (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.ii-p18.9">ἐβδελύσσοντο</span>, Sept. 
<scripRef passage="Ex. i. 2" id="iv.ii-p18.10" parsed="|Exod|1|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Exod.1.2">Ex. i. 2</scripRef>.) “The Egyptians abhorred
them;”) unto these he ran and preferred them before their
masters. From whence it is plain, that whoso is lowly, the same
is high and great of soul. For pride cometh from an ordinary mind
and an ignoble spirit, but moderation, from greatness of mind and a
lofty soul.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.ii-p19">[5.] And if you please, let us try each by
examples. For tell me, what was there ever more exalted than
Abraham? And yet it was he that said, “I am but dust and
ashes;” it was he who said, (<scripRef passage="Gen. xiii. 8" id="iv.ii-p19.1" parsed="|Gen|13|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.13.8">Gen. xiii. 8</scripRef>) “Let there be no strife
between me and thee.” But this man, so humble, (<scripRef passage="Gen. xiv. 21-24" id="iv.ii-p19.2" parsed="|Gen|14|21|14|24" osisRef="Bible:Gen.14.21-Gen.14.24">Gen. xiv. 21–24</scripRef>.) despised (“Persian,”
i.e. perhaps, “of Elam.”) Persian spoils, and regarded not
Barbaric trophies; and this he did of much highmindedness, and of a
spirit nobly nurtured. For he is indeed exalted who is truly
humble; (not the flatterer nor the dissembler;) for true greatness
is one thing, and arrogance another. And this is plain from
hence; if one man esteem clay to be clay, and despise it, and
another admire the clay as gold, and account it a great thing;
which, I ask, is the man of exalted mind? Is it not he who
refuses to admire the clay? And which, abject and mean? Is it
not he who admires it, and set much store by it? Just so do thou
esteem of this case also; that he who calls himself but dust and
ashes is exalted, although he say it out of humility; but that he
who does not consider himself dust and ashes, but treats himself
lovingly and has high thoughts, this man for his part must be
counted mean, esteeming little things to be great. Whence it is
clear that out of great loftiness of thought the patriarch spoke
that saying, “I am but dust and ashes;” from loftiness of
thought, not from arrogance.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.ii-p20">For as in bodies it is one thing to be healthy and
plump, (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.ii-p20.1">σφριγῶντα</span>, firm
and elastic.) and another thing to be swoln, although both indicate
a full habit of flesh, (but in this case of unsound, in that of
healthful flesh;) so also here: it is one thing to be arrogant,
which is, as it were, to be swoln, and another thing to be
high-souled, which is to be in a healthy state. And again, one
man is tall from the stature of his person; another, being short,
by adding buskins<note place="end" n="7" id="iv.ii-p20.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.ii-p21">

cork; used especially by tragic actors to elevate their size.
Æschylus, says Horace, improving tragedy, “<i>docuit magnumque

now tell me, which of the two should we call tall and large? Is
it not quite plain, him whose height is from himself? For the
other has it as something not his own; and stepping upon things low
in themselves, turns out a tall person. Such is the case with
many men who mount themselves up on wealth and glory; which is not
exaltation, for he is exalted who wants none of these things, but
despises them, and has his greatness from himself. Let us
therefore become humble that we may become exalted; (St.
<scripRef passage="Luke xiv. 11" id="iv.ii-p21.2" parsed="|Luke|14|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.14.11">Luke xiv. 11</scripRef>) “For he that humbleth
himself shall be exalted.” Now the self-willed man is not such
as this; rather he is of all characters the most ordinary. For
the bubble, too, is inflated, but the inflation is not sound;
wherefore we call these persons “puffed up.” Whereas the
sober-minded man has no high thoughts, not even in high fortunes,
knowing his own low estate; but the vulgar even in his trifling
concerns indulges a proud fancy.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.ii-p22">[6.] Let us then acquire that height which comes
by humility. Let us look into the nature of human things, that we
may kindle with the longing desire of the things to come; for in no
other way is it possible to become humble, except by the love of
what is divine and the contempt of what is present. For just as a
man on the point of obtaining a kingdom, if instead of that purple
robe one offer him some trivial compliment, will count it to be
nothing; so shall we also laugh to scorn all things present, if we
desire that other sort of honor. Do ye not see the children, when
in their play they make a band of soldiers, and heralds precede
them and lictors, and a boy marches in the midst in the general’s
place, how childish it all is? Just such are all human affairs;
yea and more worthless than these: to-day they are, and to-morrow
they are not. Let us therefore be above these things; and let us
not only not desire them, but even be ashamed if any one hold them
forth to us. For thus, casting out the love of these things, we
shall possess that other love which is divine, and shall enjoy
immortal glory. Which may God grant us all to obtain, through the
grace and loving-kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ; with whom be to
the Father, together with the holy and good Spirit, the glory and
the power for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p class="c24" id="iv.iii-p4">[1.] <span class="c18" id="iv.iii-p4.1">That</span> which he
exhorts others to do, saying, “(<scripRef passage="Philip. 4.6" id="iv.iii-p4.2" parsed="|Phil|4|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Phil.4.6">Phil. iv.
6</scripRef>.) Let your requests
with thanksgiving be made known unto God,” the same also he used
to do himself: teaching us to begin always from these words, and
before all things to give thanks unto God. For nothing is so
acceptable to God as that men should be thankful, both for
themselves and for others: wherefore also he prefaces almost
every Epistle with this. But the occasion for his doing so is
even more urgent here than in the other Epistles. For he that
gives thanks, does so, both as being well off, and as in
acknowledgment of a favor: now a favor is not a debt nor a
requital nor a payment: which indeed every where is important to
be said, but much more in the case of the Corinthians who were
gaping after the dividers of the Church.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.iii-p5">[2.] “Unto my God.”  Out of great affection
he seizes on that which is common, and makes it his own; as the
prophets also from time to time use to say, (<scripRef passage="Ps. xliii. 4; lxii. 1" id="iv.iii-p5.1" parsed="|Ps|43|4|0|0;|Ps|62|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.43.4 Bible:Ps.62.1">Ps. xliii. 4; lxii. 1</scripRef>.) “O God, my God;”
and by way of encouragement he incites them to use the same
language also themselves. For such expressions belong to one who
is retiring from all secular things, and moving towards Him whom he
calls on with so much earnestness: since he alone can truly say
this, who from things of this life is ever mounting upwards unto
God, and always preferring Him to all, and giving thanks
continually, not [only] for the grace already given,<note place="end" n="8" id="iv.iii-p5.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii-p6">
This seems to mean the grace given in Baptism once for all.</p></note> but whatever blessing hath been since
at any time bestowed, for this also he offereth unto Him the same
praise. Wherefore he saith not merely, “I give thanks,” but
“at all times, concerning you;” instructing them to be thankful
both always, and to no one else save God only.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.iii-p7">[3.] “For the grace of God.” Seest thou how
from every quarter he draws topics for correcting them? For where
“grace” is, “works” are not; where “works,” it is no
more “grace.” If therefore it be “grace,” why are ye
high-minded? Whence is it that ye are puffed up?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.iii-p8">“Which is given you.” And by whom was it
given? By me, or by another Apostle? Not at all, but “by
Jesus Christ.” For the expression, “In Jesus Christ,”
signifies this. Observe how in divers places he uses the word
<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.iii-p8.1">ἐν</span>, “in,” instead of <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.iii-p8.2">δἰ  οὗ</span>, “through means of whom;” therefore its sense
is no less.<note place="end" n="9" id="iv.iii-p8.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii-p9">
[This is true, but modern criticism prefers the literal sense
of the preposition; <i>in</i> <i>Jesus Christ</i>, i.e., in your
fellowship with him. C.]</p></note></p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.iii-p10">“That in every thing ye were enriched.” Again,
by whom? By Him, is the reply. And not merely “ye were
enriched,” but “in every thing.” Since then it is first of
all, “riches” then, “riches of God,” next, “in every
thing,” and lastly, “through the Only-Begotten,” reflect on
the ineffable treasure!</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.iii-p11"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 1.5" id="iv.iii-p11.1" parsed="|1Cor|1|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.1.5">Ver. 5</scripRef>.
“In all utterance, and all knowledge.” “Word” [“or
utterance,”] not such as the heathen, but that of God. For
there is knowledge without “word,” and there is knowledge with
“word.” For so there are many who possess knowledge, but have
not the power of speech; as those who are uneducated and unable to
exhibit clearly what they have in their mind. Ye, saith he, are
not such as these, but competent both to understand and to
speak.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.iii-p12"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 1.6" id="iv.iii-p12.1" parsed="|1Cor|1|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.1.6">Ver. 6</scripRef>.
“Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you.” Under
the color of praises and thanksgiving he touches them sharply.
“For not by heathen philosophy,” saith he, “neither by
heathen discipline, but “the grace of God,” and by the
“riches,” and the “knowledge,” and the “word” given by
Him, were you enabled to learn the doctrines of the truth, and to
be confirmed unto the testimony of the Lord; that is, unto the
Gospel. For ye had the benefit of many signs, many wonders,
unspeakable grace, to make you receive the Gospel. If therefore
ye were established by signs and grace, why do ye waver?” Now
these are the words of one both reproving, and at the same time
prepossessing them in his favor.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.iii-p13">[4.] <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 1.7" id="iv.iii-p13.1" parsed="|1Cor|1|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.1.7">Ver. 7</scripRef>. “So that ye come behind
in no gift.” A great question here arises. They who had been
“enriched in all utterance,” so as in no respect to “come
behind in any gift,” are they carnal? For if they were such at
the <pb n="7" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_7.html" id="iv.iii-Page_7" />beginning, much more now.
How then does he call them “carnal?” For, saith he, (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. iii. 1" id="iv.iii-p13.2" parsed="|1Cor|3|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.3.1">1 Cor. iii. 1</scripRef>.) “I was not able to speak
unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal.” What must we
say then? That having in the beginning believed, and obtained all
gifts, (for indeed they sought them earnestly,) they became remiss
afterwards. Or, if not so, that not unto all are either these
things said or those; but the one to such as were amenable to his
censures, the other to such as were adorned with his praises. For
as to the fact that they still had gifts; (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. xiv. 26, 29" id="iv.iii-p13.3" parsed="|1Cor|14|26|0|0;|1Cor|14|29|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.14.26 Bible:1Cor.14.29">1 Cor. xiv. 26, 29</scripRef>.) “Each one,” saith he,
“hath a psalm, hath a revelation, hath a tongue, hath an
interpretation; let all things be done unto edifying.” And,
“Let the prophets speak two or three.” Or we may state it
somewhat differently; that as it is usual with us to call the
greater part the whole, so also he hath spoken in this place.
Withal, I think he hints at his own proceedings; for he too had
shewn forth signs; even as also he saith in the second Epistle to
them, (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. xii. 12, 13" id="iv.iii-p13.4" parsed="|2Cor|12|12|12|13" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.12.12-2Cor.12.13">2 Cor. xii. 12,
13</scripRef>.) “Truly the signs
of an Apostle were wrought among you in all patience:” and
again, “For what is there wherein you were inferior to other
churches?”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.iii-p14">Or, as I was saying, he both reminds them of his own
miracles and speaks thus with an eye to those who were still
approved. For many holy men were there who had “set themselves
to minister unto the saints,” and had become “the first fruits
of Achaia;” as he declareth (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. 16.15" id="iv.iii-p14.1" parsed="|1Cor|16|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.16.15">ch. xvi. 15</scripRef>.) towards the end.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.iii-p15">[5.] In any case, although the praises be not very
close to the truth, still however they are inserted by way of
precaution, (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.iii-p15.1">οἰκονομικῶς</span>)
preparing the way beforehand for his discourse. For whoever at
the very outset speaks things unpleasant, excludes his words from a
hearing among the weaker: since if the hearers be his equals in
degree they feel angry; if vastly inferior they will be vexed. To
avoid this, he begins with what seem to be praises. I say, seem;
for not even did this praise belong to them, but to the grace of
God. For that they had remission of sins, and were justified,
this was of the Gift from above. Wherefore also he dwells upon
these points, which shew the loving-kindness of God, in order that
he may the more fully purge out their malady.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.iii-p16">[6.] “Waiting for the revelation (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.iii-p16.1">ἀποκάλυψιν</span>.) of our Lord Jesus Christ.”
“Why make ye much ado,” saith he, “why are ye troubled that
Christ is not come? Nay, he is come; and the Day is henceforth at
the doors.” And consider his wisdom; how withdrawing them from
human considerations he terrifies them by mention of the fearful
judgment-seat, and thus implying that not only the beginnings must
be good, but the end also. For with all these gifts, and with all
else that is good, we must be mindful of that Day: and there is
need of many labors to be able to come unto the end.
“Revelation” is his word; implying that although He be not
seen, yet He is, and is present even now, and then shall appear.
Therefore there is need of patience: for to this end did ye
receive the wonders, that ye may remain firm.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.iii-p17">[7.] <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 1.8" id="iv.iii-p17.1" parsed="|1Cor|1|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.1.8">Ver. 8</scripRef>. “Who shall also confirm
you unto the end, that ye may be unreprovable.” Here he seems
to court them, but the saying is free from all flattery; for he
knows also how to press them home; as when he saith, (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. iv. 18, 21" id="iv.iii-p17.2" parsed="|1Cor|4|18|0|0;|1Cor|4|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.4.18 Bible:1Cor.4.21">1 Cor. iv. 18, 21</scripRef>.) “Now some are puffed up as
though I would not come to you:” and again, “What will ye?
shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of
meekness?” And, (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. xiii. 3" id="iv.iii-p17.3" parsed="|2Cor|13|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.13.3">2
Cor. xiii. 3</scripRef>.) “Since
ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me.” But he is also
covertly accusing them: for, to say, “He shall confirm,” and
the word “unreprovable” marks them out as still wavering, and
liable to reproof.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.iii-p18">But do thou consider how he always fasteneth
them as with nails to the Name of Christ. And not any man nor
teacher, but continually the Desired One Himself is remembered by
him: setting himself, as it were to arouse those who were
heavy-headed after some debauch. For no where in any other
Epistle doth the Name of Christ occur so continually. But here it
is, many times in a few verses; and by means of it he weaves
together, one may say, the whole of the proem. Look at it from
the beginning. “Paul called [to be] an Apostle of Jesus Christ,
to them that have been sanctified in Jesus Christ, who call upon
the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ, grace [be] unto you and peace
from God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ. I thank my God
for the grace which hath been given you by Jesus Christ, even as

revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ, who shall confirm you
unreprovable in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. God is
faithful, by whom ye have been called into the fellowship of His
Son Jesus Christ our Lord. And I beseech you by the Name of our
Lord Jesus Christ.” Seest thou the constant repetition of the
Name of Christ? From whence it is plain even to the most

How great a thing saith he here!  How vast in the magnitude of the
gift which he declares!  Into the fellowship of the Only-Begotten
have ye been called, and do ye addict yourselves unto men? What
can be worse than this wretchedness? And how have ye been
called? By the Father. For since “through Him,” and “in
Him,” were phrases which he was constantly employing in regard of
the Son, lest men might suppose that he so mentioneth Him as being
less, he ascribeth the same to the Father. For not by this one
and that one, saith he, but “by the Father” have ye been
called; by Him also have ye been “enriched.” Again, “ye
have been called;” ye did not yourselves approach. But what
means, “into the fellowship of His Son?” Hear him declaring
this very thing more clearly elsewhere. (<scripRef passage="2 Tim. ii. 12" id="iv.iii-p21.2" parsed="|2Tim|2|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Tim.2.12">2 Tim. ii. 12</scripRef>.) If we suffer, we shall also
reign with Him; if we die with Him, we shall also live with Him.
Then, because it was a great thing which He had said, he adds an
argument fraught with unanswerable conviction; for, saith he,
“God is faithful,” i.e. “true.” Now if “true,” what
things He hath promised He will also perform. And He hath
promised that He will make us partakers of His only-begotten Son;
for to this end also did He call us. For (<scripRef passage="Rom. xi. 29" id="iv.iii-p21.3" parsed="|Rom|11|29|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.11.29">Rom. xi. 29</scripRef>.) “His gifts, and the
calling of God,” are without repentance.</p>

not receive the blessings; but this was no longer of Him that
called, but of their lack of sense. For He indeed was willing to
give, but they, by refusing to receive, cast themselves away.

in that case were they pardonable in making excuse; however, they
would have been able to say that so it was: but if the call be
unto cleansing, (Comp. <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 1.4-7" id="iv.iii-p22.2" parsed="|1Cor|1|4|1|7" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.1.4-1Cor.1.7">i. 4–7</scripRef>.) and righteousness, and
sanctification, and redemption, and grace, and a free gift, and the
good things in store, which eye hath not seen, nor ear heard; and
it be God that calls, and calls by Himself; what pardon can they
deserve, who come not running to Him? Let no one therefore accuse
God; for unbelief cometh not of Him that calleth, but of those who

<p class="c19" id="iv.iii-p28">What then saith the Christian? “It were <pb n="9" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_9.html" id="iv.iii-Page_9" />meet to have implanted in us
the knowledge itself of virtue.” He hath implanted it; for if
he had not done so, whence should we have known what things are to
be done, what left undone? Whence are the laws and the
tribunals? But “God should have imparted not [merely]
knowledge, but also the very doing of it [virtue].” For what
then wouldest thou have to be rewarded, if the whole were of God? 
For tell me, doth God punish in the same manner thee and the Greek
upon committing sin<note place="end" n="14" id="iv.iii-p28.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii-p29">
The meaning seems to be, “Whatever other sins you commit,
you have not the sin of unbelief to answer for; and would, I
suppose, think it hard, if <i>cæteris paribus</i> you were counted
as guilty as an unbeliever. Now this your instinctive judgment
confutes any hope you may have that nature and circumstances may
excuse you in any other sin.”</p></note>? Surely
not. For up to a certain point thou hast confidence, viz. that
which ariseth from the true knowledge. What then, if any one
should now say that on the score of knowledge thou and the Greek
will be accounted of like desert? Would it not disgust thee? I
think so, indeed. For thou wouldest say that the Greek, having of
his own wherewith to attain knowledge, was not willing. If then
the latter also should say that God ought to have implanted
knowledge in us naturally, wilt thou not laugh him to scorn, and
say to him, “But why didst thou not seek for it? why wast thou
not in earnest even as I?” And thou wilt stand firm with much
confidence, and say that it was extreme folly to blame God for not
implanting knowledge by nature. And this thou wilt say, because
thou hast obtained what appertains to knowledge. So also hadst
thou performed what appertains to practice, thou wouldest not have
raised these questions: but thou art tired of virtuous practice,
therefore thou shelterest thyself with these inconsiderate words.
But how could it be at all right to cause that by necessity one
should become good? Then shall we next have the brute beasts
contending with us about virtue, seeing that some of them are more
temperate than ourselves.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.iii-p30">But thou sayest, “I had rather have been good by
necessity, and so forfeited all rewards, than evil by deliberate
choice, to be punished and suffer vengeance.” But it is
impossible that one should ever be good by necessity. If
therefore thou knowest not what ought to be done, shew it, and then
we will tell you what is right to say. But if thou knowest that
uncleanness is wicked, wherefore dost thou not fly from the evil
thing?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.iii-p31">“I cannot,” thou sayest. But others who
have done greater things than this will plead against thee, and
will more than prevail to stop thy mouth. For thou, perhaps,
though living with a wife, art not chaste; but another even without
a wife keeps his chastity inviolate. Now what excuse hast thou
for not keeping the rule, while another even leaps beyond the
lines<note place="end" n="15" id="iv.iii-p31.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii-p32">
<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.iii-p32.1">Τὰ σκὰμματα</span>. The image is borrowed
from the gymnastic exercise of leaping.</p></note> that have been
drawn to mark it?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.iii-p33">But thou sayest “I am not of this sort in my
bodily frame, or my turn of mind.” That is for want, not of
power, but of will. For thus I prove that all have a certain
aptness towards virtue: That which a man cannot do, neither will
he be able to do though necessity be laid upon him; but, if,
necessity being laid upon him, he is able, he that leaveth it
undone, leaveth it undone out of choice. The kind of thing I mean
is this: to fly up and be borne towards heaven, having a heavy
body, is even simply impossible. What then, if a king should
command one to do this, and threaten death, saying, “Those men
who do not fly, I decree that they lose their heads, or be burnt,
or some other such punishment:” would any one obey him? 
Surely not. For nature is not capable of it. But if in the case
of chastity this same thing were done, and he were to lay down laws
that the unclean should be punished, be burnt, be scourged, should
suffer the extremity of torture, would not many obey the law? 
“No” thou wilt say: “for there is appointed, even now, a
law forbidding to commit adultery<note place="end" n="16" id="iv.iii-p33.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii-p34">
From the time of Constantine to that of Justinian it was a capital
offence. Gibbon, e. 44. note 197.</p></note>
and all do not obey it.” Not because the fear looses its power,
but because the greater part expect to be unobserved. So that if
when they were on the point of committing an unclean action the
legislator and the judge came before them, the fear would be strong
enough to cast out the lust. Nay, were I to apply another kind of
force inferior to this; were I to take the man and remove him from
the beloved person, and shut him up close in chains, he will be
able to bear it, without suffering any great harm. Let us not say
then that such an one is by nature evil: for if a man were by
nature good, he could never at any time become evil; and if he were
by nature evil, he could never be good. But now we see that
changes take place rapidly, and that men quickly shift from this
side to the other, and from that fall back again into this. And
these things we may see not in the Scriptures only, for instance,
that publicans have become apostles; and disciples, traitors; and
harlots, chaste; and robbers, men of good repute; and magicians
have worshipped; and ungodly men passed over unto godliness, both
in the New Testament and in the Old; but even every day a man may
see many such things occurring. Now if things were natural, they
could not change. For so we, being by nature susceptible, could
never by any exertions become void 
<pb n="10" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_10.html" id="iv.iii-Page_10" />of feeling. For that which is whatever it is by
nature, can never fall away from such its natural condition. No
one, for example, ever changed from sleeping to not sleeping: no
one from a state of corruption unto incorruption: no one from
hunger to the perpetual absence of that sensation. Wherefore
neither are these things matters of accusation, nor do we reproach
ourselves for them; nor ever did any one, meaning to blame another,
say to him, “O thou, corruptible and subject to passion:” but
either adultery or fornication, or something of that kind, we
always lay to the charge of those who are responsible; and we bring
them before judges, who blame and punish, and in the contrary cases
award honors.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.iii-p35">[11.] Since then both from our conduct towards one
another, and from others’ conduct to us when judged, and from the
things about which we have written laws, and from the things
wherein we condemn ourselves, though there be no one to accuse us;
and from the instances of our becoming worse through indolence, and
better through fear; and from the cases wherein we see others doing
well and arriving at the height of self-command, (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.iii-p35.1">φιλοσοφίας</span>) it is quite clear that we also have
it in our power to do well: why do we, the most part, deceive
ourselves in vain with heartless pretexts and excuses, bringing not
only no pardon, but even punishment intolerable? When we ought to
keep before our eyes that fearful day, and to give heed to virtue;
and after a little labor, obtain the incorruptible crowns? For
these words will be no defence to us; rather our fellow-servants,
and those who have practised the contrary virtues, will condemn all
who continue in sin: the cruel man will be condemned by the
merciful; the evil, by the good; the fierce, by the gentle; the
grudging, by the courteous; the vain-glorious, by the self-denying;
the indolent, by the serious; the intemperate, by the
sober-minded. Thus will God pass judgment upon us, and will set
in their place both companies; on one bestowing praise, on the
other punishment. But God forbid that any of those present should
be among the punished and dishonored, but rather among those who
are crowned and the winners of the kingdom. Which may God grant
us all to obtain through the grace and loving-kindness of our Lord
Jesus Christ; with Whom unto the Father and the Holy Ghost be
glory, power, honor, now and ever, and unto everlasting ages.
Amen.</p>

<p class="c27" id="iv.iv-p3">Now I beseech you, brethren, through the name of our
Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak of the same thing, and that
there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfected together
in the same mind and in the same judgment.</p>

<p class="c24" id="iv.iv-p4"><span class="c18" id="iv.iv-p4.1">What</span> I have continually
been saying, that we must frame our rebukes gently and gradually,
this Paul doth here also; in that, being about to enter upon a
subject full of many dangers and enough to tear up the Church from
her foundations he uses very mild language. His word is that he
“beseeches” them, and beseeches them “through Christ;” as
though not even he were sufficient alone to make this supplication,
and to prevail.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.iv-p5">But what is this, “I beseech you through
Christ?” “I take Christ to fight on my side, and to aid me,
His injured and insulted Name.” An awful way of speaking
indeed! lest they should prove hard and shameless: for sin makes
men restless. Wherefore if at once (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.iv-p5.1">ἄν μὲν  εὐθέως ἐπιπλήξης</span> Savil. <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.iv-p5.2"> ἄν μὴ</span> Ben.) you sharply rebuke you make a man
fierce and impudent: but if you put him to shame, you bow down
his neck, you check his confidence, you make him hang down his
head. Which object being Paul’s also, he is content for a while
to beseech them through the Name of Christ. And what, of all
things, is the object of his request?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.iv-p6">“That ye may all speak the same thing, and
that there be no divisions [schisms] among you.” The emphatic
force of the word “schism,” I mean the name itself, was a
sufficient accusation. For it was not that they had become many
parts, each entire within itself, but rather the One [Body which
originally existed] had perished.  For had they<note place="end" n="17" id="iv.iv-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iv-p7">
i.e. the bodies formed by separation.</p></note> been entire Churches, there might be
many of them; but if they were divisions, then that first One was
gone. For that which is entire within itself not only does not
become many by division into many parts, but even the original One
is lost. Such is the nature of divisions.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.iv-p8"><pb n="11" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_11.html" id="iv.iv-Page_11" />[2.] In the
next place, because he had sharply dealt with them by using the
word “schism,” he again softens and soothes them, saying,
“That ye may be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in
the same judgment.” That is; since he had said, “That ye may
all speak the same thing;” “do not suppose,” he adds, “that
I said concord should be only in words; I seek for that harmony
which is of the mind.” But since there is such a thing as
agreement in words, and that hearty, not however on all subjects,
therefore he added this, “That ye may be perfected together.”
For he that is united in one thing, but in another dissents, is no
longer “perfected,” nor fitted in to complete accordance.
There is also such a thing as harmony of opinions, where there is
not yet harmony of sentiment; for instance, when having the same
faith we are not joined together in love: for thus, in opinions
we are one, (for we think the same things,) but in sentiment not
so. And such was the case at that time; this person choosing one
[leader], and that, another. For this reason he saith it is
necessary to agree both in “mind” and in “judgment.” For
it was not from any difference in faith that the schisms arose, but
from the division of their judgment through human
contentiousness.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.iv-p9">[3.] But seeing that whoso is blamed is unabashed
so long as he hath no witnesses, observe how, not permitting them
to deny the fact, he adduces some to bear witness.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.iv-p10"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 1.11" id="iv.iv-p10.1" parsed="|1Cor|1|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.1.11">Ver. 11</scripRef>. “For it hath been
signified unto me concerning you, my brethren, by them which are of
the household of Chloe.” Neither did he say this at the very
beginning, but first he brought forward his charge; as one who put
confidence in his informants. Because, had it not been so, he
would not have found fault: for Paul was not a person to believe
lightly. Neither then did he immediately say, “it hath been
signified,” lest he might seem to blame on their authority: 
neither does he omit all mention of them, lest he should seem to
speak only from himself. And again, he styles them
“brethren;” for although the fault be plain, there is nothing
against calling people brethren still. Consider also his prudence
in not speaking of any distinct person, but of the entire family;
so as not to make them hostile towards the informer: for in this
way he both protects him, and fearlessly opens the accusation.
For he had an eye to the benefit not of the one side only, but of
the other also. Wherefore he saith not, “It hath been declared
to me by certain,” but he indicates also the household, lest they
might suppose that he was inventing.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.iv-p11">[4.]  What was “declared? “That there are
contentions among you.” Thus, when he is rebuking them, he
saith, “That there be no divisions among you;” but when he is
reporting the statements of others, he doth it more gently; saying,
“For it hath been declared unto me…that there are contentions
among you; in order that he might not bring trouble upon the
informants.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.iv-p12">Next he declares also the kind of contention.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.iv-p13"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 1.12" id="iv.iv-p13.1" parsed="|1Cor|1|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.1.12">Ver. 12</scripRef>. “That each one of you
saith, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas.” “I
say, contentions,” saith he, “I mean, not about private
matters, but of the more grievous sort.” “That each one of
you saith;” for the corruption pervaded not a part, but the whole
of the Church. And yet they were not speaking about himself, nor
about Peter, nor about Apollos; but he signifies that if these were
not to be leaned on, much less others. For that they had not
spoken about them, he saith further on: “And these things I
have transferred in a figure unto myself and Apollos, that ye may
learn in us not to go beyond the things which are written.” For
if it were not right for them to call themselves by the name of
Paul, and of Apollos, and of Cephas, much less of any others. If
under the Teacher and the first of the Apostles, and one that had
instructed so much people, it were not right to enroll themselves,
much less under those who were nothing. By way of hyperbole then,
seeking to withdraw them from their disease, he sets down these
names. Besides, he makes his argument less severe, not mentioning
by name the rude dividers of the Church, but concealing them, as
behind a sort of masks, with the names of the Apostles.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.iv-p14">“I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of
Cephas.” Not esteeming himself before Peter hath he set his
name last, but preferring Peter to himself, and that greatly. He
arranged his statement in the way of climax, (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.iv-p14.1">κατὰ  αῦξησιν</span>) that he might not be supposed to do this for envy;
or, from jealousy, to be detracting from the honor of others.
Wherefore also he put his own name first. For he who puts himself
foremost to be rejected, doth so not for love of honor, but for
extreme contempt of this sort of reputation. He puts himself, you
see, in the way of the whole attack, and then mentions Apollos, and
then Cephas. Not therefore to magnify himself did he do this, but
in speaking of wrong things he administers the requisite correction
in his own person first.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.iv-p15">[5.] But that those who addicted themselves to
this or that man were in error, is evident. And rightly he
rebukes them, saying, “Ye do not well in that ye say, ‘I am of
Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas.’” But why did he
add, “And I of Christ?” For although these who addicted
themselves to men were in error, 
<pb n="12" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_12.html" id="iv.iv-Page_12" />not surely (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.iv-p15.1">οὔδε που</span>
Bened. <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.iv-p15.2">οὐ δήπου</span> Savil.) those who dedicated themselves
unto Christ. But this was not his charge, that they called
themselves by the Name of Christ, but that they did not all call
themselves by that Name alone. And I think that he added this of
himself, wishing to make the accusation more grievous, and to point
out that by this rule Christ must be considered as belonging to one
party only: although they were not so using the Name
themselves. For that this was what he hinted at he declared in
the sequel, saying,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.iv-p16"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 1.13" id="iv.iv-p16.1" parsed="|1Cor|1|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.1.13">Ver. 13</scripRef>. “Is Christ divided.”
What he saith comes to this: “Ye have cut in pieces Christ, and
distributed His body.” Here is anger! here is chiding! here are
words full of indignation!  For whenever instead of arguing he
interrogates only, his doing so implies a confessed absurdity.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.iv-p17">But some say that he glanced at something else, in
saying, “Christ is divided:” as if he had said, “He hath
distributed to men and parted the Church, and taken one share
Himself, giving them the other.” Then in what follows, he
labors to overthrow this absurdity, saying, “Was Paul crucified
for you, or were ye baptized into the name of Paul?” Observe
his Christ-loving mind; how thenceforth he brings the whole matter
to a point in his own name, shewing, and more than shewing, that
this honor belongs to no one. And that no one might think it was
envy which moved him to say these things, therefore he is
constantly putting himself forward. Observe, too, his considerate
way, in that he saith not, “Did Paul make the world? did Paul
from nothing produce you into being?” But only those things
which belonged as choice treasures to the faithful, and were
regarded with great solicitude—those he specifies, the Cross, and
Baptism, and the blessings following on these. For the
loving-kindness of God towards men is shewn by the creation of the
world also: in nothing, however, so much as by the (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.iv-p17.1">τῆς  συγκαταβάσεως</span>) condescension through the Cross. And he
said not, “did Paul die for you?” but, “was Paul
crucified?” setting down also the kind of death.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.iv-p18">“Or were ye baptized into the name of
Paul?” Again, he saith not, “did Paul baptize you?” For
he did baptize many: but this was not the question, by whom they
had been baptized, but, into whose name they had been baptized! 
For since this also was a cause of schisms, their being called
after the name of those who baptized them, he corrects this error
likewise saying, “Were ye baptized into the name of Paul?”
“Tell me not,” saith he, “who baptized, but into whose
name. For not he that baptizeth, but he who is invoked in the
Baptism, is the subject of enquiry. For this is He who forgives
our sins<note place="end" n="18" id="iv.iv-p18.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iv-p19">
This seems to allude to the words of the ancient Oriental
Creed, as preserved by S. Cyril of Jerusalem, “I believe in one
Baptism of Repentance, for the Remission of Sins;” (see Bp. Bull,
<i>Jud. Eccl. Cath</i>. c. vi. §. 4. &amp;c.) into which Creed, in
all probability, the people of Antioch had been
baptized.</p></note>.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.iv-p20">And at this point he stays the discourse, and does
not pursue the subject any further. For he saith not, “Did Paul
declare to you the good things to come? Did Paul promise you the
kingdom of heaven?” Why, then, I ask, doth he not add these
questions also? Because it is not all as one, to promise a
kingdom and to be crucified. For the former neither had danger
nor brought shame; but the latter, all these. Moreover, he proves
the former from the latter: for having said, (<scripRef passage="Rom. viii. 32" id="iv.iv-p20.1" parsed="|Rom|8|32|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.8.32">Rom. viii. 32</scripRef>.) “He that spared not His
own Son,” he adds, “How shall He not with Him also freely give
us all things?” And again, (<scripRef passage="Rom. v. 10" id="iv.iv-p20.2" parsed="|Rom|5|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.5.10">Rom. v. 10</scripRef>.) “For if when we were
enemies we were reconciled unto God by the death of His Son, much
more bring reconciled, we shall be saved.” This was one reason
for his not adding what I just mentioned: and also because the
one they had not as yet, but of the other they had already made
trial. The one were in promise; the other had already come to
pass.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.iv-p21">[6.] <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 1.14" id="iv.iv-p21.1" parsed="|1Cor|1|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.1.14">Ver. 14</scripRef>. “I thank God that I
baptized none of you but Crispus and Gaius.” “Why are you
elate at having baptized, when I for my part even give thanks that
I have not done so!” Thus saying, by a kind of divine art
(<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.iv-p21.2">οἰκονομικῶς</span>) he does away
with their swelling pride upon this point; not with the efficacy of
the baptism, (God forbid,) but with the folly of those who were
puffed up at having been baptizers: first, by showing that the
Gift is not theirs; and, secondly, by thanking God therefore. For
Baptism truly is a great thing: but its greatness is not the work
of the person baptizing, but of Him who is invoked in the
Baptism: since to baptize is nothing as regards man’s labor,
but is much less than preaching the Gospel. Yea, again I say,
great indeed is Baptism, and without baptism it is impossible to
obtain the kingdom. Still a man of no singular excellence is able
to baptize, but to preach the Gospel there is need of great
labor.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.iv-p22"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 1.15" id="iv.iv-p22.1" parsed="|1Cor|1|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.1.15">Ver. 15</scripRef>. He states also the reason,
why he giveth thanks that he had baptized no one. What then is
this reason? “Lest anyone should say that ye were baptized into
my own name.” Why, did he mean that they said this in those
other cases? Not at all; but, “I fear,” saith he, “lest the
disease should proceed even to that. For if, when insignificant
persons and of little worth baptize, a heresy ariseth, had I, the
first announcer of Baptism, baptized many, it was likely that they
forming a party, would not <pb n="13" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_13.html" id="iv.iv-Page_13" />only
call themselves by my name, but also ascribe the Baptism to
me.” For if from the inferiors so great an evil arose, from
those of higher order it would perhaps have gone on to something
far more grievous.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.iv-p23"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 1.16" id="iv.iv-p23.1" parsed="|1Cor|1|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.1.16">Ver. 16</scripRef>. Then, having abashed those
who were unsound in this respect and subjoining, “I baptized also
the house of Stephanas,” he again drags down their pride, saying
besides, “I know not whether I baptized any other.” For by
this he signifies that neither did he seek much to enjoy the honor
accruing hereby from the multitude, nor did he set about this work
for glory’s sake.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.iv-p24"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 1.17" id="iv.iv-p24.1" parsed="|1Cor|1|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.1.17">Ver. 17</scripRef>. And not by these only, but
also by the next words, he greatly represses their pride, saying,
“Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the Gospel:”
for the more laborious part, and that which needed much toil and a
soul of iron, and that on which all depended, was this. And
therefore it was that Paul had it put into his hand.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.iv-p25">And why, not being sent to baptize, did he
baptize? Not in contention with Him that sent him, but in this
instance laboring beyond his task. For he saith not, “I was
forbidden,” but, “I was not sent for this, but for that which
was of the greatest necessity.” For preaching the Gospel is a
work perhaps for one or two; but baptizing, for everyone endowed
with the priesthood. For a man being instructed and convinced, to
take and baptize him is what any one whatever might do: for the
rest, it is all effected by the will of the person drawing near,
and the grace of God. But when unbelievers are to be instructed,
there must be great labor, great wisdom. And at that time there
was danger also annexed. In the former case the whole thing is
done, and he is convinced, who is on the point of initiation: and
it is no great thing when a man is convinced, to baptize him. But
in the later case the labor is great, to change the deliberate
will, to alter the turn of mind, and to tear up error by the roots,
and to plant the truth in its place.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.iv-p26">Not that he speaks out all this, neither doth he
argue in so many words that Baptism has no labor, but that
preaching has. For he knows how always to subdue his tone,
whereas in the comparison with heathen wisdom he is very earnest,
the subject enabling him to use more vehemency of language.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.iv-p27">Not therefore in opposition to Him that sent

For even now, we
commit this matter to the simpler sort of presbyters, but the word
of doctrine unto the wiser: for there is the labor and the
sweat. Wherefore he saith himself, (<scripRef passage="1 Tim. v. 17" id="iv.iv-p28.5" parsed="|1Tim|5|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.5.17">1 Tim. v. 17</scripRef>.) “Let the Elders who rule
well be counted worthy of double honor, especially they who labor
in the word and in teaching.” For as to teach the wrestlers in
the games is the part of a spirited and skilful trainer, but to
place the crown on the conquerors head may be that of one who
cannot even wrestle, (although it be the crown which adds splendor
to the conqueror,) so also in Baptism. It is impossible to be
saved without it, yet it is no great thing which the baptizer doth,
finding the will ready prepared.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.iv-p29">[7.] “Not in wisdom of words, lest the Cross of
Christ should be made of none effect.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.iv-p30">Having brought down the swelling pride of those who
were arrogant because of their baptizing, he changes his ground
afterwards to meet those who boasted about heathen wisdom, and
against them he puts on his armor with more vehemency. For to
those who were puffed up with baptizing he said, “I give thanks
that I baptized no one;” and, “for Christ sent me not to
baptize.” He speaks neither vehemently nor argumentatively,
but, having just hinted his meaning in a few words, passeth on
quickly. But here at the very outset he gives a severe blow,
saying, “Lest the Cross of Christ be made void.” Why then
pride thyself on a thing which ought to make thee hide thy face? 
Since, if this wisdom is at war with the Cross and fights with the
Gospel, it is not meet to boast about it, but to retire with
shame. For this was the cause why the Apostles were not wise; not
through any weakness of the Gift, but lest the Gospel preached
suffer harm. The sort of people therefore above mentioned were
not those employed in advocating the Word: rather they were among
its defamers. The unlearned men were the establishers of it.
This was able to check vain glory, this to repress arrogance, this
to enforce moderation.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.iv-p31">“But if it was ‘not by wisdom of speech,’ why
did they send Apollos who was eloquent?” It was not, he
replies, through confidence in his power of speech, but because he
was (<scripRef passage="Acts xviii. 24, 29" id="iv.iv-p31.1" parsed="|Acts|18|24|0|0;|Acts|18|29|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.18.24 Bible:Acts.18.29">Acts xviii. 24,
29</scripRef>) “mighty in the
Scriptures,” and “confuted the Jews.” And besides the point
in question was that the leaders and first disseminators of the
word were not eloquent; since these were the very persons to
require some great power, for the expulsion of error in the first
instance; and then, namely at the very outset, was the abundant
strength needed. Now He who could do without educated persons at
first, if afterwards some being eloquent were admitted <pb n="14" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_14.html" id="iv.iv-Page_14" />by Him, He did so not because He
wanted them, but because He would make no distinctions. For as He
needed not wise men to effect whatever He would, so neither, if any
were afterwards found such, did He reject them on that account.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.iv-p32">[8.] But prove to me that Peter and Paul
were eloquent. Thou canst not: for they were “unlearned and
ignorant men!”<note place="end" n="20" id="iv.iv-p32.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iv-p33">

Christ, when He was sending out His disciples into the world,
having shewn unto them His power in Palestine first, and said,
(St. <scripRef passage="Luke xxii. 35" id="iv.iv-p33.3" parsed="|Luke|22|35|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.22.35">Luke xxii.

“When I sent you forth without purse and wallet and shoe, lacked
ye any thing?” permitted them from that time forward to possess
both a wallet and a purse; so also He hath done here: for the
point was the manifestation of Christ’s power, not the rejection
of persons from the Faith on account of their Gentile wisdom, if
they were drawing nigh. When the Greeks then charge the disciples
with being uneducated, let us be even more forward in the charge
than they. Nor let anyone say, “Paul was wise;” but while we
exalt those among them who were great in wisdom and admired for
their excellency of speech, let us allow that all on our side were
uneducated; for it will be no slight overthrow which they will
sustain from us in that respect also: and so the victory will be
brilliant indeed.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.iv-p34">I have said these things, because I once heard a
Christian disputing in a ridiculous manner with a Greek, and both
parties in their mutual fray ruining themselves. For what things
the Christian ought to have said, these the Greek asserted; and
what things it was natural to expect the Greek would say, these the
Christian pleaded for himself. As thus: the dispute being about
Paul and Plato, the Greek endeavored to show that Paul was
unlearned and ignorant; but the Christian, from simplicity, was
anxious to prove that Paul was more eloquent than Plato. And so
the victory was on the side of the Greek, this argument being
allowed to prevail. For if Paul was a more considerable person
than Plato, many probably would object that it was not by grace,
but by excellency of speech that he prevailed; so that the
Christian’s assertion made for the Greek. And what the Greek
said made for the Christian’s; for if Paul was uneducated and yet
overcame Plato, the victory, as I was saying, was brilliant; the
disciples of the latter, in a body, having been attracted by the
former, unlearned as he was, and convinced, and brought over to his
side. From whence it is plain that the Gospel was a result not of
human wisdom, but of the grace of God.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.iv-p35">Wherefore, lest we fall into the same error, and be
laughed to scorn, arguing thus with Greeks whenever we have a
controversy with them; let us charge the Apostles with want of
learning; for this same charge is praise. And when they say that
the Apostles were rude, let us follow up the remark and say that
they were also untaught, and unlettered, and poor, and vile, and
stupid, and obscure. It is not a slander on the Apostles to say
so, but it is even a glory that, being such, they should have
outshone the whole world. For these untrained, and rude, and
illiterate men, as completely vanquished the wise, and powerful,
and the tyrants, and those who flourished in wealth and glory and
all outward good things, as though they had not been men at all: 
from whence it is manifest that great is the power of the Cross;
and that these things were done by no human strength. For the
results do not keep the course of nature, rather what was done was
above all nature. Now when any thing takes place above nature,
and exceedingly above it, on the side of rectitude and utility; it
is quite plain that these things are done by some Divine power and
cooperation. And observe; the fisherman, the tentmaker, the
publican, the ignorant, the unlettered, coming from the far distant
country of Palestine, and having beaten off their own ground the
philosophers, the masters of oratory, the skillful debaters, alone
prevailed against them in a short space of time; in the midst of
many perils; the opposition of peoples and kings, the striving of
nature herself, length of time, the vehement resistance of
inveterate custom, demons in arms, the devil in battle array and
stirring up all, kings, rulers, peoples, nations, cities,
barbarians, Greeks, philosophers, orators, sophists, historians,
laws, tribunals, divers kinds of punishments, deaths innumerable
and of all sorts. But nevertheless all these were confuted and
gave way when the fisherman spake; just like the light dust which
cannot bear the rush of violent winds. Now what I say is, let us
learn thus to dispute with the Greeks; that we be not like beasts
and cattle, but prepared concerning “the hope which is in us.”
(<scripRef passage="1 Pet. 3.15" id="iv.iv-p35.1" parsed="|1Pet|3|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Pet.3.15">1
St. Pet. iii. 15</scripRef>.) And
let us pause for a while to work out this topic, no unimportant
one; and let us say to them, How did the weak overcome the strong;
the twelve, the world? Not by using the same armor, but in
nakedness contending with men in arms.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.iv-p36">For say, if twelve men, unskilled in matters of war,
were to leap into an immense and armed host of soldiers, themselves
not only unarmed but of weak frame also; and to receive no harm
from them, nor yet be wounded, though assailed with ten thousand
weapons; if while the darts were striking them, with <pb n="15" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_15.html" id="iv.iv-Page_15" />bare naked body they overthrew all
their foes using no weapons but striking with the hand, and in
conclusion killed some, and others took captive and led away,
themselves receiving not so much as a wound; would anyone have ever
said that the thing was of man? And yet the trophy of the
Apostles is much more wonderful than that. For a naked man’s
escaping a wound is not so wonderful by far as that the ordinary
and unlettered person—that a fisherman—should overcome such a
degree of talent: (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.iv-p36.1">δεινότητος</span>)  and neither for fewness, nor for
poverty, nor for dangers, nor for prepossession of habit, nor for
so great austerity of the precepts enjoined, nor for the daily
deaths, nor for the multitude of those who were deceived, nor for
the great reputation of the deceivers be turned from his
purpose.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.iv-p37">[9.] Let this, I say, be our way of overpowering
them, and of conducting our warfare against them; and let us
astound them by our way of life rather than by words. For this is
the main battle, this is the unanswerable argument, the argument
from conduct. For though we give ten thousand precepts of
philosophy in words, if we do not exhibit a life better than
theirs, the gain is nothing. For it is not what is said that
draws their attention, but their enquiry is, what we do; and they
say, “Do thou first obey thine own words, and then admonish
others. But if while thou sayest, infinite are the blessings in
the world to come, thou seem thyself nailed down to this world,
just as if no such things existed, thy works to me are more
credible than thy words. For when I see thee seizing other
men’s goods, weeping immoderately over the departed, doing ill in
many other things, how shall I believe thee that there is a
resurrection?” And what if men utter not this in words? they
think it and turn it often in their minds. And this is what stays
the unbelievers from becoming Christians.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.iv-p38">Let us win them therefore by our life. Many, even
among the untaught, have in that way astounded the minds of
philosophers, as having exhibited in themselves also that
philosophy which lies in deeds, and uttered a voice clearer than a
trumpet by their mode of life and self-denial. For this is
stronger than the tongue. But when I say, “one ought not to
bear malice,” and then do all manner of evils to the Greek, how
shall I be able by words to win him, while by my deeds I am
frightening him away? Let us catch them then by our mode of life;
and by these souls let us build up the Church, and of these let us
amass our wealth. There is nothing to weigh against a soul, not
even the whole world. So that although thou give countless
treasure unto the poor, thou wilt do no such work as he who
converteth one soul. (<scripRef passage="Jer. xv. 19" id="iv.iv-p38.1" parsed="|Jer|15|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Jer.15.19">Jer. xv. 19</scripRef>.) “For he that taketh forth
the precious from the vile shall be as my mouth:” so He
speaks. A great good it is, I grant, to have pity on the poor;
but it is nothing equal to the withdrawing them from error. For
he that doth this resembles Paul and Peter: we being permitted to
take up their Gospel, not with perils such as theirs;—with
endurance of famines and pestilences, and all other evils, (for the
present is a season of peace;)—but so as to display that
diligence which cometh of zeal. For even while we sit at home we
may practice this kind of fishery. Who hath a friend or relation
or inmate of his house, these things let him say, these do; and he
shall be like Peter and Paul. And why do I say Peter and Paul? 
He shall be the mouth of Christ. For He saith, “He that taketh
forth the precious from the vile shall be as My mouth.” And
though thou persuade not to-day, to-morrow thou shalt persuade.
And though thou never persuade, thou shalt have thine own reward in
full. And though thou persuade not all, a few out of many
persuade all men; but still they discoursed with all, and for all
they have their reward. For not according to the result of the
things that are well done, but according to the intention of the
doers, is God wont to assign the crowns; though thou pay down but
two farthings, He receiveth them; and what He did in the case of
the widow, the same will He do also in the case of those who
teach. Do not thou then, because thou canst not save the world,
despise the few; nor through longing after great things, withdraw
thyself from the lesser. If thou canst not an hundred, take thou
charge of ten; if thou canst not ten, despise not even five; if
thou canst not five, do not overlook one; and if thou canst not
one, neither so despair, nor keep back what may be done by thee.
Seest thou not how, in matters of trade, they who are so employed
make their profit not only of gold but of silver also? For if we
do not slight the little things, we shall keep hold also of the
great. But if we despise the small, neither shall we easily lay
hand upon the other. Thus individuals become rich, gathering both
small things and great. And so let us act; that in all things
enriched, we may obtain the kingdom of heaven; through the grace
and loving-kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, through Whom and with
Whom unto the Father together with the Holy Spirit be glory, power,
honor, now and henceforth and for evermore. Amen.</p>

<p class="c27" id="iv.v-p3">For the word of the cross is to them that perish
foolishness; but to us which are saved it is the power of God.
For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the
prudence of the prudent will I reject. Where is the Wise? Where
is the Scribe? Where is the Disputer of the World?</p>

<p class="c24" id="iv.v-p4"><span class="c18" id="iv.v-p4.1">To</span> the sick and gasping
even wholesome meats are unpleasant, friends and relations
burdensome; who are often times not even recognized, but are rather
accounted intruders. Much like this often is the case of those
who are perishing in their souls. For the things which tend to
salvation they know not; and those who are careful about them they
consider to be troublesome. Now this ensues not from the nature
of the thing, but from their disease. And just what the insane
do, hating those who take care of them, and besides reviling them,
the same is the case with unbelievers also. But as in the case of
the former, they who are insulted then more than ever compassionate
them, and weep, taking this as the worst symptom of the disease in
its intense form, when they know not their best friends; so also in
the case of the Gentiles let us act; yea more than for our wives
let us wail over them, because they know not the common
salvation. For not so dearly ought a man to love his wife as we
should love all men, and draw them over unto salvation; be a man a
Gentile, or be he what he may. For these then let us weep; for
“the word of the Cross is to them foolishness,” being itself
Wisdom and Power. For, saith he, “the word of the Cross to them
that perish is foolishness.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.v-p5">For since it was likely that they, the Cross being
derided by the Greeks, would resist and contend by aid of that
wisdom, which came (forsooth) of themselves, as being disturbed by
the expression of the Greeks; Paul comforting them saith, think it
not strange and unaccountable, which is taking place. This is the
nature of the thing, that its power is not recognized by them that
perish. For they are beside themselves, and behave as madmen; and
so they rail and are disgusted at the medicines which bring
health.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.v-p6">[2.] But what sayest thou, O man? Christ became
a slave for thee, “having taken the form of a slave,” (<scripRef passage="Philipp. 2.7" id="iv.v-p6.1" parsed="|Phil|2|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Phil.2.7">Phil. ii.
7</scripRef>.) and was crucified,
and rose again. And when thou oughtest for this reason to adore
Him risen and admire His loving kindness; because what neither
father, nor friend, nor son, did for thee, all this the Lord
wrought for thee, the enemy and offender—when, I say, thou
oughtest to admire Him for these things, callest thou that
foolishness, which is full of so great wisdom? Well, it is
nothing wonderful; for it is a mark of them that perish not to
recognize the things which lead to salvation. Be not troubled,
therefore, for it is no strange nor unaccountable event, that
things truly great are mocked at by those who are beside
themselves. Now such as are in this mind you cannot convince by
human wisdom. Nay, if you want so to convince them, you do but
the contrary. For the things which transcend reasoning require
faith alone. Thus, should we set about convincing men by
reasonings, how God became man, and entered into the Virgin’s
womb, and not commit the matter unto faith, they will but deride
the more. Therefore they who inquire by reasonings, it is they
who perish.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.v-p7">And why speak I of God? for in regard of created
things, should we do this, great derision will ensue. For suppose
a man, wishing to make out all things by reasoning; and let him try
by thy discourse to convince himself how we see the light; and do
thou try to convince him by reasoning. Nay, thou canst not: for
if thou sayest that it suffices to see by opening the eyes, thou
hast not expressed the manner, but the fact. For “why see we
not,” one will say, “by our hearing, and with our eyes hear? 
And why hear we not with the nostril, and with the hearing
smell?” If then, he being in doubt about these things, and we
unable to give the explanation of them, he is to begin laughing,
shall not we rather laugh him to scorn? “For since both have
their origin from one brain, since the two members are near
neighbors to each other, why can they not do the same work?”
Now we shall not be able to state the cause nor the method of the
unspeakable and curious operation; and should we make the attempt,
we should be laughed to scorn. Wherefore, leaving this unto
God’s power and boundless wisdom, let us be silent.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.v-p8"><pb n="17" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_17.html" id="iv.v-Page_17" />Just so with
regard to the things of God; should we desire to explain them by
the wisdom which is from without, great derision will ensue, not
from their infirmity, but from the folly of men. For the great
things of all no language can explain.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.v-p9">[3.] Now observe: when I say, “He was
crucified;” the Greek saith, “And how can this be reasonable? 
Himself He helped not when undergoing crucifixion and sore trial at
the moment of the Cross: how then after these things did He rise
again and help others? For if He had been able, before death was
the proper time.” (For this the Jews actually said.) (St.
<scripRef passage="Matt. xxvii. 41, 42" id="iv.v-p9.1" parsed="|Matt|27|41|27|42" osisRef="Bible:Matt.27.41-Matt.27.42">Matt. xxvii. 41, 42</scripRef>.) “But He who helped not
Himself, how helped he others? There is no reason in it,” saith
he. True, O man, for indeed it is above reason; and unspeakable
is the power of the Cross. For that being actually in the midst
of horrors, He should have shewn Himself above all horrors; and
being in the enemy’s hold should have overcome; this cometh of
Infinite Power. For as in the case of the Three Children, their
not entering the furnace would not have been so astonishing, as
that having entered in they trampled upon the fire;—and in the
case of Jonah, it was a greater thing by far, after he had been
swallowed by the fish, to suffer no harm from the monster, than if
he had not been swallowed at all;—so also in regard of Christ;
His not dying would not have been so inconceivable, as that having
died He should loose the bands of death. Say not then, “why did
He not help Himself on the Cross?” for He was hastening on to
close conflict with death himself. (See Hooker, E. P. v. 48.
9.) He descended not from the Cross, not because He could not,
but because He would not. For Him Whom the tyranny of death
restrained not, how could the nails of the Cross restrain?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.v-p10">[4.] But these things, though known to us, are not
so as yet to the unbelievers. Wherefore he said that “the word
of the Cross is to them that perish foolishness; but to us who are
saved it is the power of God. For it is written, I will destroy
the wisdom of the wise, and the prudence of the prudent will I
reject.” Nothing from himself which might give offence, does he
advance up to this point; but first he comes to the testimony of
the Scripture, and then furnished with boldness from thence, adopts
more vehement words, and saith,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.v-p11"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 1.20,21" id="iv.v-p11.1" parsed="|1Cor|1|20|1|21" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.1.20-1Cor.1.21">Ver. 20, 21</scripRef>. “Hath not God made
foolish the wisdom of this world? Where is the wise? Where the
Scribe? Where the disputer of this world? Hath not God made
foolish the wisdom of this world? For seeing that in the wisdom
of God the world through its wisdom knew God, it was God’s good
pleasure through the foolishness of the preaching to save them that
believe.” Having said, “It is written, I will destroy the
wisdom of the wise,” He subjoins demonstration from facts,
saying, “Where is the wise? where the Scribe?” at the same time
glancing at both Gentiles and Jews. For what sort of philosopher,
which among those who have studied logic, which of those knowing in
Jewish matters, hath saved us and made known the truth? Not
one. It was the fisherman’s work, the whole of it.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.v-p12">Having then drawn the conclusion which he had in
view, and brought down their pride, and said, “Hath not God made
foolish the wisdom of this world?” he states also the reason why
these things were so done. “For seeing that in the wisdom of
God,” saith he, “the world through its wisdom knew not God,”
the Cross appeared. Now what means, “in the wisdom of God?”
The wisdom apparent in those works whereby it was His will to make
Himself known. For to this end did he frame them, and frame them
such as they are, that by a sort of proportion, (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.v-p12.1">ἀναλόγως</span>)
from the things which are seen admiration of the Maker might be
learned. Is the heaven great, and the earth boundless? Wonder
then at Him who made them. For this heaven, great as it is, not
only was made by Him, but made with ease; and that boundless earth,
too, was brought into being even as if it had been nothing.
Wherefore of the former He saith, (<scripRef passage="Ps. cii. 25" id="iv.v-p12.2" parsed="|Ps|102|25|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.102.25">Ps. cii. 25</scripRef>. <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.v-p12.3"> τῶν χειρῶν</span>. LXX.) “The works of Thy fingers are
the heavens,” and concerning the earth, (<scripRef passage="Is. xl. 23" id="iv.v-p12.4" parsed="|Isa|40|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.40.23">Is. xl. 23</scripRef>. LXX.) “Who hath made the
earth as it were nothing.” Since then by this wisdom the world
was unwilling to discover God, He employed what seemed to be
foolishness, i.e. the Gospel, to persuade men; not by reasoning,
but by faith. It remains that where God’s wisdom is, there is
no longer need of man’s. For before, to infer that He who made
the world such and so great, must in all reason be a God possessed
of a certain uncontrollable, unspeakable power; and by these means
to apprehend Him;—this was the part of human wisdom. But now we
need no more reasonings, but faith alone. For to believe on Him
that was crucified and buried, and to be fully persuaded that this
Person Himself both rose again and sat down on high; this needeth
not wisdom, nor reasonings, but faith. For the Apostles
themselves came in not by wisdom, but by faith, and surpassed the
heathen wise men in wisdom and loftiness, and that so much the
more, as to raise disputings is less than to receive by faith the
things of God. For this transcends all human understanding.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.v-p13">But how did He “destroy wisdom?” Being made
known to us by Paul and others like him, He shewed it to be
unprofitable. For towards 
<pb n="18" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_18.html" id="iv.v-Page_18" />receiving the evangelical proclamation, neither
is the wise profited at all by wisdom, nor the unlearned injured at
all by ignorance. But if one may speak somewhat even wonderful,
ignorance rather than wisdom is a condition suitable for that
impression, and more easily dealt with. For the shepherd and the
rustic will more quickly receive this, once for all both repressing
all doubting thoughts and delivering himself to the Lord. In this
way then He destroyed wisdom. For since she first cast herself
down, she is ever after useful for nothing. Thus when she ought
to have displayed her proper powers, and by the works to have seen
the Lord, she would not. Wherefore though she were now willing to
introduce herself, she is not able. For the matter is not of that
kind; this way of knowing God being far greater than the other.
You see then, faith and simplicity are needed, and this we should
seek every where, and prefer it before the wisdom which is from
without. For “God,” saith he, “hath made wisdom
foolish.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.v-p14">But what is, “He hath made foolish?” He hath
shewn it foolish in regard of receiving the faith. For since they
prided themselves on it, He lost no time in exposing it. For what
sort of wisdom is it, when it cannot discover the chief of things
that are good? He caused her therefore to appear foolish, after
she had first convicted herself. For if when discoveries might
have been made by reasoning, she proved nothing, now when things
proceed on a larger scale, how will she be able to accomplish
aught? now when there is need of faith alone, and not of
acuteness? You see then, God hath shewn her to be foolish.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.v-p15">It was His good pleasure, too, by the foolishness of
the Gospel to save; foolishness, I say, not real, but appearing to
be such. For that which is more wonderful yet is His having
prevailed by bringing in, not another such wisdom more excellent
than the first, but what seemed to be foolishness. He cast out
Plato for example, not by means of another philosopher of more
skill, but by an unlearned fisherman. For thus the defeat became
greater, and the victory more splendid.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.v-p16">[5.] <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 1.22-24" id="iv.v-p16.1" parsed="|1Cor|1|22|1|24" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.1.22-1Cor.1.24">Ver. 22–24</scripRef>. Next, to shew the power of
the Cross, he saith, “For Jews ask for signs and Greeks seek
after wisdom: but we preach Christ crucified, unto Jews a
stumbling-block, and unto Greeks foolishness; but unto them that
are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the Power of God, and the
Wisdom of God.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.v-p17">Vast is the import of the things here spoken!  For
he means to say how by contraries God hath overcome, and how the
Gospel is not of man. What he saith is something of this sort.
When, saith he, we say unto the Jews, Believe; they answer, Raise
the dead, Heal the demoniacs, Shew unto us signs. But instead
thereof what say we? That He was crucified, and died, who is
preached. And this is enough, not only to fail in drawing over
the unwilling, but even to drive away those even who are willing.
Nevertheless, it drives not away, but attracts and holds fast and
overcomes.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.v-p18">Again; the Greeks demand of us a rhetorical style,
and the acuteness of sophistry. But preach we to these also the
Cross: and that which, in the case of the Jews seemed to be
weakness, this in the case of the Greeks is foolishness.
Wherefore, when we not only fail in producing what they demand, but
also produce the very opposites of their demand; (for the Cross has
not merely no appearance of being a sign sought out by reasoning,
but even the very annihilation of a sign;—is not merely deemed no
proof of power, but a conviction of weakness;—not merely no
display of wisdom, but a suggestion of foolishness;)—when
therefore they who seek for signs and wisdom not only receive not
the things which they ask, but even hear the contrary to what they
desire, and then by means of contraries are persuaded;—how is not
the power of Him that is preached unspeakable? As if to some one
tempest-tost and longing for a haven, you were to shew not a haven
but another wilder portion of the sea, and so could make him follow
with thankfulness? Or as if a physician could attract to himself
the man that was wounded and in need of remedies, by promising to
cure him not with drugs, but with burning of him again!  For this
is a result of great power indeed. So also the Apostles
prevailed, not simply without a sign, but even by a thing which
seemed contrary to all the known signs. Which thing also Christ
did in the case of the blind man. For when He would heal him, He
took away the blindness by a thing that increased it: i.e. He put
on clay. (St. <scripRef passage="John ix. 6" id="iv.v-p18.1" parsed="|John|9|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.9.6">John ix.
6</scripRef>.) As then by means of
clay He healed the blind man, so also by means of the Cross He
brought the world to Himself. That certainly was adding an
offence, not taking an offence away. So did He also in creation,
working out things by their contraries. With sand, for instance,
He walled in the sea, having made the weak a bridle to the
strong. He placed the earth upon water, having taken order that
the heavy and the dense should be borne on the soft and fluid. By
means of the prophets again with a small piece of wood He raised up
iron from the bottom. (<scripRef passage="2 Kings vi. 5-7" id="iv.v-p18.2" parsed="|2Kgs|6|5|6|7" osisRef="Bible:2Kgs.6.5-2Kgs.6.7">2
Kings vi. 5-7</scripRef>.) In like
manner also with the Cross He hath drawn the world to Himself.
For as the water beareth up the earth, so also the Cross beareth up
the world. You see now, it is proof of great power and wisdom, to
convince by means of the things which tell 
<pb n="19" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_19.html" id="iv.v-Page_19" />directly against us. Thus the Cross seems to be
matter of offence; and yet far from offending, it even
attracts.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.v-p19">[6.] <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 1.25" id="iv.v-p19.1" parsed="|1Cor|1|25|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.1.25">Ver. 25</scripRef>. All these things,
therefore, Paul bearing in mind, and being struck with
astonishment, said that “the foolishness of God is wiser than
men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men;” in relation
to the Cross, speaking of a folly and weakness, not real but
apparent. For he is answering with respect unto the other
party’s opinion. For that which philosophers were not able by
means of reasoning to accomplish, this, what seemed to be
foolishness did excellently well. Which then is the wiser, he
that persuadeth the many, or he that persuadeth few, or rather no
one? He who persuadeth concerning the greatest points, or about
matters which are nothing? (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.v-p19.2">μηδὲν όντων</span> Reg. <span class="c18" id="iv.v-p19.3">
ms.</span> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.v-p19.4">μη δεόντων</span>
Bened.) What great labors did Plato endure, and his followers,
discoursing to us about a line, and an angle, and a point, and
about numbers even and odd, and equal unto one another and unequal,
and such-like spiderwebs; (for indeed those webs are not more
useless to man’s life than were these subjects;) and without
doing good to any one great or small by their means, so he made an
end of his life. How greatly did he labor, endeavoring to show
that the soul was immortal! and even as he came he went away,
having spoken nothing with certainty, nor persuaded any hearer.
But the Cross wrought persuasion by means of unlearned men; yea it
persuaded even the whole world: and not about common things, but
in discourse of God, and the godliness which is according to truth,
and the evangelical way of life, and the judgment of the things to
come. And of all men it made philosophers: the very rustics,
the utterly unlearned. Behold how “the foolishness of God is
wiser than men,” and “the weakness stronger?” How
“stronger?” Because it overran the whole world, and took all
by main force, and while men were endeavoring by ten thousands to
extinguish the name of the Crucified, the contrary came to pass: 
that flourished and increased more and more, but they perished and
wasted away; and the living at war with the dead, had no power.
So that when the Greek calls me foolish, he shows himself above
measure foolish: since I who am esteemed by him a fool, evidently
appear wiser than the wise. When he calls me weak, then he shows
himself to be weaker. For the noble things which publicans and
fishermen were able to effect by the grace of God, these,
philosophers, and rhetoricians, and tyrants, and in short the whole
world, running ten thousand ways here and there, could not even
form a notion of. For what did not the Cross introduce? The
doctrine concerning the Immortality of the Soul; that concerning
the Resurrection of the Body; that concerning the contempt of
things present; that concerning the desire of things future. Yea,
angels it hath made of men, and all, every where, practice
self-denial, (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.v-p19.5">φιλοσοφοῦσι</span>) and
show forth all kinds of fortitude.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.v-p20">[7.] But among them also, it will be said, many
have been found contemners of death. Tell me who? was it he who
drank the hemlock? But if thou wilt, I can bring forward ten
thousand such from within the Church. For had it been lawful when
prosecution befel them to drink hemlock and depart, all had become
more famous than he. And besides, he drank when he was not at
liberty to drink or not to drink; but willing or against his will
he must have undergone it: no effect surely of fortitude, but of
necessity, and nothing more. For even robbers and man-slayers,
having fallen under the condemnation of their judges, have suffered
things more grievous. But with us it is all quite the contrary.
For not against their will did the martyrs endure, but of their
will, and being at liberty not to suffer; shewing forth fortitude
harder than all adamant. This then you see is no great wonder,
that he whom I was mentioning drank hemlock; it being no longer in
his power not to drink, and also when he had arrived at a very
great age. For when he despised life he stated himself to be
seventy years old; if this can be called despising. For I for my
part could not affirm it: nor, what is more, can anyone else.
But show me some one enduring firm in torments for godliness’
sake, as I shew thee ten thousand every where in the world. Who,
while his nails were tearing out, nobly endured? Who, while his
body joints were wrenching (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.v-p20.1">ἀνασκαπτομένων</span>) asunder? Who, while his body
was cut in pieces, (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.v-p20.2">τοῦ σώματος  κατὰ μέρος  πορθουμένου</span>; <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.v-p20.3">τῆς</span> <span class="Greek" id="iv.v-p20.4">κεφαλῆς</span>;)
member by member? or his head? Who, while his bones were forced
out by levers? (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.v-p20.5">ἀναμοχλευομένων</span>)  Who, while placed
without intermission upon frying-pans? Who, when thrown into a
caldron? Show me these instances. For to die by hemlock is all
as one with a man’s continuing in a state of sleep. Nay even
sweeter than sleep is this sort of death, if report say true. But
if certain [of them] did endure torments, yet of these, too, the
praise is gone to nothing. For on some disgraceful occasion they
perished; some for revealing mysteries; some for aspiring to
dominion; others detected in the foulest crimes; others again
rashly, and fruitlessly, and foolishly, there being no reason for
it, made away with themselves. But not so with us. Wherefore of
the deeds of those nothing is said; but these flourish and daily
increase. Which Paul having 
<pb n="20" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_20.html" id="iv.v-Page_20" />in mind said, “The weakness of God is stronger
than all men.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.v-p21">[8.] For that the Gospel is divine, even from
hence is evident; namely, whence could it have occurred to twelve
ignorant men to attempt such great things? who sojourned in
marshes, in rivers, in deserts; who never at any time perhaps had
entered into a city nor into a forum;—whence did it occur, to set
themselves in array against the whole world? For that they were
timid and unmanly, he shews who wrote of them, not apologizing, nor
enduring to throw their failings into the shade: which indeed of
itself is a very great token of the truth. What then doth he say
about them? That when Christ was apprehended, after ten thousand
wonders, they fled; and he who remained, being the leader of the
rest, denied. Whence was it then that they who when Christ was
alive endured not the attack of the Jews; now that He was dead and
buried, and as ye say, had not risen again, nor had any talk with
them, nor infused courage into them—whence did they set
themselves in array against so great a world? Would they not have
said among themselves, “what meaneth this? Himself He was not
able to save, and will He protect us? Himself He defended not
when alive, and will He stretch out the hand unto us now that he is
dead? Himself, when alive, subdued not even one nation; and are
we to convince the whole world by uttering His Name?” How, I
ask, could all this be reasonable, I will not say, as something to
be done, but even as something to be imagined? From whence it is
plain that had they not seen Him after He was risen, and received
most ample proof of his power, they would not have ventured so
great a cast.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.v-p22">[9.] For suppose they had possessed friends
innumerable; would they not presently have made them all enemies,
disturbing ancient customs, and removing their father’s
landmarks? (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.v-p22.1">ὅρια</span> <span class="c18" id="iv.v-p22.2">Ms</span>. Reg. <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.v-p22.3">ἔθη</span> Ben.) But as it was, they had them
for enemies, all, both their own countrymen and foreigners. For
although they had been recommended to veneration by everything
external, would not all men have abhorred them, introducing a new
polity? But now they were even destitute of everything; and it
was likely that even on that account all would hate and scorn them
at once. For whom will you name? The Jews? Nay, they had
against them an inexpressible hatred on account of the things which
had been done unto the Master. The Greeks then? Why, first of
all, these had rejected one not inferior to them; and no man knew
this so well as the Greeks. For Plato, who wished to strike out a
new form of government, or rather a part of government; and that
not by changing the customs relating to the gods, but merely by
substituting one line of conduct for another; was cast out of
Sicily, and went near to lose his life.<note place="end" n="21" id="iv.v-p22.4"><p class="endnote" id="iv.v-p23">
Plutarch, in <i>Dion</i>. t. v. p. 162. ed. Bryan. “Plato
having been introduced to Dionysius, they discoursed in general
about human virtue; when Plato maintained that any thing might be
credible rather than for tyrants to be truly brave. Then changing
the subject, he argued concerning Justice, that the life of the
just is blessed, of the unjust miserable. The tyrant was not well
pleased with the discourse, understanding it as a reproof: and he
was vexed with the bystanders, who mightily approved the man, and
were taken with his remarks. At last, in anger and bitterness, he
asked him what was his object in coming to Sicily. He said, To
look for a good man. By heaven, he replied, it is clear you have
not found him. Now Dion’s friends thought this had been the end
of his anger, and as Plato was anxious to go, they provided him
with a passage in a galley, in which Pollis the Spartan was sailing
to Greece. But Dionysius secretly besought Pollis, if possible,
to kill him at sea, but at any rate to sell him for a slave, for
that he would never be the worse for it, but just as happy, in that
Justice of his, though he became a slave. Upon which it is said
that Pollis took Plato to Ægina and sold him there, the Æginetæ
being at war with Athens, and having made a decree, that any
Athenian coming there should be sold.”</p></note>  This however did not ensue: so
that he lost his liberty alone. And had not a certain Barbarian
been more gentle than the tyrant of Sicily, nothing could have
rescued the philosopher from slavery throughout life in a foreign
land. And yet it is not all one to innovate in affairs of the
kingdom, and in matters of religious worship. For the latter more
than any thing else causes disturbance and troubles men. For to
say, “let such and such an one marry such a woman, and let the
guardians<note place="end" n="22" id="iv.v-p23.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.v-p24">
<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.v-p24.1">φύλακες</span>, Plato’s word in the <i>
Republic</i> for citizens.</p></note> [of the
commonwealth] exercise their guardianship so and so,” is not
enough to cause any great disturbance: and especially when all
this is lodged in a book, and no great anxiety on the part of the
legislator to carry the proposals into practice. On the other
hand, to say, “they be no gods which men worship, but demons; He
who was crucified is God;” ye well know how great wrath it
kindled, how severely men must have paid for it, what a flame of
war it fanned.</p>

had friends, and that influence which comes from eloquence, and
were held in admiration because of their philosophy; yet
nevertheless none of these profited them. And <pb n="21" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_21.html" id="iv.v-Page_21" />the great Socrates, too, he who
surpassed in philosophy all among them, for this reason drank
hemlock, because in his discourses concerning the gods he was
suspected of moving things a little aside. Now if the suspicion
alone of innovation brought so great danger on philosophers and
wise men, and on those who had attained boundless popularity; and
if they were not only unable to do what they wished, but were
themselves also driven from life and county; how canst thou choose
but be in admiration and astonishment, when thou seest that the
fisherman hath produced such an effect upon the world, and
accomplished his purposes; hath overcome all both Barbarians and
Greeks.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.v-p30">[10.] But they did not, you will say, introduce
strange gods as the others did. Well, and in that you are naming
the very point most to be wondered at; that the innovation is
twofold, both to pull down those which are, and to announce the
Crucified. For from whence came it into their minds to proclaim
such things? whence, to be confident about their event? Whom of
those before them could they perceive to have prospered in any such
attempt? Were not all men worshipping demons? Were not all used
to make gods of the elements? Was not the difference [but] in the
mode of impiety? But nevertheless they attacked all, and
overthrew all, and overran in a short time the whole world, like a
sort of winged beings; making no account of dangers, of deaths, of
the difficulty of the thing, of their own fewness, of the multitude
of the opponents, of the authority, the power, the wisdom of those
at war with them. For they had an ally greater than all these,
the power of Him that had been crucified and was risen again. It
would not have been so wondrous, had they chosen to wage war with
the world in the literal sense, (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.v-p30.1">πόλεμον  αἰσθητόν</span>) as this which in fact has taken place. For
according to the law of battle they might have stood over against
the enemies, and occupying some adverse ground, have arrayed
themselves accordingly to meet their foes, and have taken their
time for attack and close conflict. But in this case it is not
so. For they had no camp of their own, but were mingled with
their enemies, and thus overcame them. Even in the midst of their
enemies as they went about, they eluded their grasp, (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.v-p30.2">λαβὰς</span> Reg. <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.v-p30.3">βλαβὰς</span> Bened.) and became superior, and
achieved a splendid victory; a victory which fulfils the prophecy
that saith, “Even in the midst of thine enemies thou shalt have
dominion.” (<scripRef passage="Ps. cx. 2" id="iv.v-p30.4" parsed="|Ps|110|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.110.2">Ps. cx.
2</scripRef>.) For this it was,
which was full of all astonishment, that their enemies having them
in their power, and casting them into prison and chains not only
did not vanquish them, but themselves also eventually had to bow
down to them: the scourgers to the scourged, the binders in
chains to those who were bound, the persecutors to the fugitives.
All these things then we could say unto the Greeks, yea much more
than these; for the truth has enough and greatly to spare. (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.v-p30.5">πολλή  τῆς ἀληθείας ἡ περιουσία</span>.) And if ye will follow
the argument, we will teach you the whole method of fighting
against them. In the meanwhile let us here hold fast two heads;
How did the weak overcome the strong? and, From whence came it into
their thoughts, being such as they were, to form such plans, unless
they enjoyed Divine aid?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.v-p31">[11.] So far then as to what we have to say. But
let us shew forth by our actions all excellencies of conduct, and
kindle abundantly the fire of virtue. For “ye are lights,”
saith  he, “shining in the midst of the world.” (<scripRef passage="Philipp. 2.15" id="iv.v-p31.1" parsed="|Phil|2|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Phil.2.15">Phil.
ii. 15</scripRef>.) And unto each
of us God hath committed a greater function than He hath to the
sun: greater than heaven, and earth, and sea; by so much greater,
as spiritual things be more excellent than things sensible. When
then we look unto the solar orb, and admire the beauty, and the
body and the brightness of the luminary, let us consider again that
greater and better is the light which is in us, as indeed the
darkness also is more dreadful unless we take heed. And in fact a
deep night oppresses the whole world. This is what we have to
dispel and dissolve. It is night not among heretics and among
Greeks only, but also in the multitude on our side, in respect of
doctrines and of life. For many entirely disbelieve the
resurrection; many fortify themselves with their horoscope; (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.v-p31.2">γὲνεσιν  ἑαυτοῖς</span> <span class="Greek" id="iv.v-p31.3">ἐπιτειχίζουσι</span>) many adhere to superstitious
observances, and to omens, and auguries, and presages. And some
likewise employ amulets and charms. But to these also we will
speak afterwards, when we have finished what we have to say to the
Greeks.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.v-p32">In the meanwhile hold fast the things which have
been said, and be ye fellow-helpers with me in the battle; by your
way of life attracting them to us and changing them. For, as I am
always saying, He that teaches high morality (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.v-p32.1">περὶ  φιλοσοφίας</span>) ought first to teach it in his own person, and
be such as his hearers cannot do without. Let us therefore become
such, and make the Greeks feel kindly towards us. And this will
come to pass if we make up our minds not only not to do ill, but
also to suffer ill. Do we not see when little children being
borne in their father’s arms give him that carries them blows on
the cheek, how sweetly the father lets the boy have his fill of
wrath, and when he sees that he has spent his passion, how his
countenance brightens up? In like manner let us also act; and as
fathers with children, so let us discourse with the Greeks. <pb n="22" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_22.html" id="iv.v-Page_22" />For all the Greeks are children.
And this, some of their own writers have said, that “that people
are children always, and no Greek is an old man.” Now children
cannot bear to take thought for any thing useful; so also the
Greeks would be for ever at play; and they lie on the ground,
grovelling in posture and in affections. Moreover, children
oftentimes, when we are discoursing about important things, give no
heed to anything that is said, but will even be laughing all the
time: such also are the Greeks. When we discourse of the
Kingdom, they laugh. And as spittle dropping in abundance from an
infant’s mouth, which oftentimes spoils its meat and drink, such
also are the words flowing from the mouth of the Greeks, vain and
unclean. Even if thou art giving children their necessary food,
they keep on vexing those who furnish it with evil speech, and we
must bear with them all the while. (<span class="Greek" id="iv.v-p32.2">διαβαστάζεσθαι</span>). Again, children, when they
see a robber entering and taking away the furniture, far from
resisting, even smile on the designing fellow; but shouldest thou
take away the little basket or the rattle (<span class="Greek" id="iv.v-p32.3">σεῖστρα</span>) or any other of their playthings, they
take it to heart and fret, tear themselves, and stamp on the floor;
just so do the Greeks also: when they behold the devil pilfering
all their patrimony, and even the things which support their life,
they laugh, and run to him as to a friend: but should any one
take away any possession, be it wealth or any childish thing
whatsoever of that kind, they cry, they tear themselves. And as
children expose their limbs unconsciously and blush not for shame;
so the Greeks, wallowing in whoredoms and adulteries, and laying
bare the laws of nature, and introducing unlawful intercourses, are
not abashed.</p>

This custom is referred to by St. Chrysostom in many places

of Antioch, A.D. 272, for demanding and encouraging such
applause. Vid. Euseb. E. H. vii. 30. St. Chrysostom in his 30th
Hom. on the Acts says, “When I am applauded in my speaking, for
the moment I feel as an infirm human being, (for why should not one
confess the truth?).…but when I am come home, and consider that
those who have been applauding are no wise profited, but rather by
their applause and acclamation have lost what good they might have
attained, I……feel as if I had said all to no purpose..…And
often I have thought of making a law to forbid all signs of
applause, and to enforce listening in silence and with becoming
order……Yea, if you please, let us even now pass such a
law……Why do you applaud at the very moment that I am making a
rule to check that practice? &amp;c.” iv. 784. Ed. Savil. Vid.
Bingham <i>Antiquit</i>. xiv. 4. 27; Suicer, v. <span class="Greek" id="iv.v-p34.1">κρότος</span>.</p></note>, but with all
your applause have a care lest you be among those of whom these
things are said. Wherefore I beseech you all to become men: 
since, so long as we are children, how shall we teach them
manliness? How shall we restrain them from childish folly? Let
us, therefore, become men; that we may arrive at the measure of the
stature which hath been marked out for us by Christ, and may obtain
the good things to come: through the grace and loving-kindness,
etc. etc.</p>

<i>your calling, brethren, that not many wise men after the flesh,
not many mighty, not many noble, [are called;] but God chose the
foolish things of the world, that he might put to shame them that
are wise.</i></p>

<p class="c24" id="iv.vi-p5"><span class="c18" id="iv.vi-p5.1">He</span> hath said that “the
foolishness of God is wiser than men;” he hath shewed that human
wisdom is cast out, both by the testimony of the Scriptures and by
the issue of events; by the testimony, where he says, “I will
destroy the wisdom of the wise;” by the event, putting his
argument in the form of a question, and saying, “Where is the
wise? Where the Scribe?” Again; he proved at the same time
that the thing is not new, but ancient, as it was presignified and
foretold from the beginning. For, “It is written,” saith he,
“I will destroy the wisdom of the wise.” Withal he shews that
it was neither inexpedient nor unaccountable for things to take
this course: (for, “seeing that in the wisdom of God the
world,” saith he, “knew not God, God was well pleased through
the foolishness of preaching to save them which believe:”)  and
that the Cross is a demonstration of ineffable power and wisdom,
and that the foolishness of God is far mightier than the wisdom of
man. And this again he proves not by means of the teachers, but
by means of the disciples themselves. For, “Behold your
calling,” saith he: that not only teachers of an untrained
sort, but disciples also of the like class, were objects of His
choice; that He chose “not many wise men” (that is his word)
“according to the flesh.” And so that of which he is <pb n="23" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_23.html" id="iv.vi-Page_23" />speaking is proved to surpass both in
strength and wisdom, in that it convinces both the many and the
unwise: it being extremely hard to convince an ignorant person,
especially when the discourse is concerning great and necessary
things. However, they did work conviction. And of this he calls
the Corinthians themselves as witnesses. For, “behold your
calling, brethren,” saith he: consider; examine: for that
doctrines so wise, yea, wiser than all, should be received by
ordinary men, testifies the greatest wisdom in the teacher.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.vi-p6">[2.] <span class="c18" id="iv.vi-p6.1">But</span> what
means, “according to the flesh?” According to what is in
sight; according to the life that now is; according to the
discipline of the Gentiles. Then, lest he should seem to be at
variance with himself, (for he had convinced both the Proconsul,
(<scripRef passage="Acts xiii. 12" id="iv.vi-p6.2" parsed="|Acts|13|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.13.12">Acts xiii. 12</scripRef>.) and the Areopagite, (<scripRef passage="Acts xvii. 34" id="iv.vi-p6.3" parsed="|Acts|17|34|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.17.34">Acts xvii. 34</scripRef>.) and Apollos; (<scripRef passage="Acts xviii. 26" id="iv.vi-p6.4" parsed="|Acts|18|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.18.26">Acts xviii. 26</scripRef>: through Aquila and
Priscilla) and other wise men, too, we have seen coming over to the
Gospel;) he said not, No wise man, but, “Not many wise men.”
For he did not designedly (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.vi-p6.5">ἀποκεκληρωμένως</span>) call the ignorant and pass by
the wise, but these also he received, yet the others in much larger
number. And why? Because the wise man according to the flesh is
full of extreme folly; and it is he who especially answers to the
term “foolish,” when he will not cast away his corrupt
doctrine. And as in the case of a physician who might wish to
teach certain persons the secrets of his art, those who know a few
things, having a bad and perverse mode of practicing the art which
they make a point of retaining, would not endure to learn quietly,
but they who knew nothing would most readily embrace what was
said: even so it was here. The unlearned were more open to
conviction, for they were free from the extreme madness of
accounting themselves wise. For indeed the excess of folly is in
these more than any, these, I say, who commit unto reasoning things
which cannot be ascertained except by faith. Thus, suppose the
smith by means of the tongs drawing out the red-hot iron; if any
one should insist on doing it with his hand, we should vote him
guilty of extreme folly: so in like manner the philosophers who
insisted on finding out these things for themselves disparaged the
faith. And it was owing to this that they found none of the
things they sought for.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.vi-p7">“Not many mighty, not many noble;” for these
also are filled with pride. And nothing is so useless towards an
accurate knowledge of God as arrogance, and being nailed down
(<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.vi-p7.1">προσηλῶσθαι</span>) to wealth: for
these dispose a man to admire things present, and make no account
of the future; and they stop up the ears through the multitude of
cares: but “the foolish things of the world God chose:”
which thing is the greatest sign of victory, that they were
uneducated by whom He conquers. For the Greeks feel not so much
shame when they are defeated by means of the “wise,” but are
then confounded, when they see the artisan and the sort of person
one meets in the market more of a philosopher than themselves.
Wherefore also he said himself, “That He might put to shame the
wise.” And not in this instance alone hath he done this, also
in the case of the other advantages of life. For, to proceed,
“the weak things of the world He chose that He might put to shame
the strong.” For not unlearned persons only, but needy also,
and contemptible and obscure He called, that He might humble those
who were in high places.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.vi-p8"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 1.28" id="iv.vi-p8.1" parsed="|1Cor|1|28|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.1.28">V. 28</scripRef>.
“And the base things of the world, and the things that are
despised, and the things that are not, that he might bring to
naught the things that are.” Now what doth He call things
“that are not?” Those persons who are considered to be
nothing because of their great insignificance. Thus hath He shown
forth His great power, casting down the great by those who seem to
be nothing. The same elsewhere he thus expresses, (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. xii. 9" id="iv.vi-p8.2" parsed="|2Cor|12|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.12.9">2 Cor. xii. 9</scripRef>.) “For my strength is made
perfect in weakness.” For a great power it is, to teach
outcasts and such as never applied themselves to any branch of
learning, how all at once to discourse wisely on the things which
are above the heavens. For suppose a physician, an orator, or any
one else: we then most admire him, when he convinces and
instructs those completely uneducated. Now, if to instil into an
uneducated man the rules of art be a very wonderful thing, much
more things which pertain to so high philosophy.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.vi-p9">[3.] But not for the wonders sake only, neither to
shew His own power, hath He done this, but to check also the
arrogant. And therefore he both said before, “That he might
confound the wise and the strong, that He might bring to nought the
things which are,” and here again,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.vi-p10"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 1.29" id="iv.vi-p10.1" parsed="|1Cor|1|29|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.1.29">V. 29</scripRef>.
“That no flesh should glory in the presence of God.” For God
doeth all things to this end, to repress vainglory and pride, to
pull down boasting.” “Do you, too,” saith he, “employ
yourselves in that work.” He doth all, that we may put nothing
to our own account; that we may ascribe all unto God. And have ye
given yourselves over unto this person or to that? And what
pardon will ye obtain?”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.vi-p11">For God Himself hath shown that it is not possible
we should be saved only by ourselves: and this He did from the
beginning. For neither then could men be saved by themselves;
<pb n="24" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_24.html" id="iv.vi-Page_24" />but it required their
compassing the beauty of the heaven, and the extent of the earth,
and the mass of creation besides; if so they might be led by the
hand to the great artificer of all the works. And He did this,
repressing beforehand the self-conceit which was after to arise.
Just as if a master who had given his scholar charge to follow
wheresoever he might lead, when he sees him forestalling, and
desiring to learn all things of himself, should permit him to go
quite astray; and when he hath proved him incompetent to acquire
the knowledge, should thereupon at length introduce to him what
himself has to teach: so God also commanded in the beginning to
trace Him by the idea which the creation gives; but since they
would not, He, after showing by the experiment that they are not
sufficient for themselves, conducts them again unto Him by another
way. He gave for a tablet, the world; but the philosophers
studied not in those things, neither were willing to obey Him, nor
to approach unto Him by that way which Himself commanded. He
introduces another way more evident than the former; one that might
bring conviction that man is not of himself alone sufficient unto
himself. For then scruples of reasoning might be started, and the
Gentile wisdom employed, on their part whom He through the creation
was leading by the hand; but now, unless a man become a fool, that
is, unless he dismiss all reasoning and all wisdom, and deliver up
himself unto the faith, it is impossible to be saved. You see
that besides making the way easy, he hath rooted up hereby no
trifling disease, namely, in forbidding to boast, and have high
thoughts: “that no flesh should glory:” for hence came the
sin, that men insisted on being wiser than the laws of God; not
willing so to obtain knowledge as He had enacted: and therefore
they did not obtain it at all. So also was it from the
beginning. He said unto Adam, “Do such a thing, and such
another thou must not do.” He, as thinking to find out
something more, disobeyed; and even what he had, he lost. He
spake unto those that came after, “Rest not in the creature; but
by means of it contemplate the Creator.” They, forsooth, as if
making out something wiser than what had been commanded, set in
motion windings innumerable. Hence they kept dashing against
themselves and one another, and neither found God, nor concerning
the creature had any distinct knowledge; nor had any meet and true
opinion about it. Wherefore again, with a very high hand, (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.vi-p11.1">ἐκ
πολλοῦ τοῦ  περίοντος</span>) lowering their conceit. He admitted the
uneducated first, showing thereby that all men need the wisdom from
above. And not only in the matter of knowledge, but also in all
other things, both men and all other creatures He hath constituted
so as to be in great need of Him; that they might have this also as
a most forcible motive of submission and attachment, lest turning
away they should perish. For this cause He did not suffer them to
be sufficient unto themselves. For if even now many, for all
their indigency, despise Him, were the case not so, whither would
they not have wandered in haughtiness? So that He stayed them
from boasting as they did, not from any grudge to them, but to draw
them away from the destruction thence ensuing.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.vi-p12">[4.] <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 1.30" id="iv.vi-p12.1" parsed="|1Cor|1|30|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.1.30">V. 30</scripRef> “But of Him are ye in Christ
Jesus, who was made unto us wisdom from God, and righteousness, and
sanctification, and redemption.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.vi-p13">The expression “of Him,” I suppose he uses here,
not of our introduction into being, but with reference to the
faith: that is, to our having become children of God, “not of
blood, nor of the will of the flesh.” (St. 
<scripRef passage="John i. 13" id="iv.vi-p13.1" parsed="|John|1|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.1.13">John i. 13</scripRef>)  “Think not then, that
having taken away our glorying, He left us so: for there is
another, a greater glorying, His gift. For ye are the children of
Him in whose presence it is not meet to glory, having become so
through Christ.” And since he has said, “The foolish things
of the world He chose, and the base,” he signifies that they are
nobler than all, having God for their Father. And of this
nobility of ours, not this person or that, but Christ is the cause,
having made us wise, and righteous, and holy. For so mean the
words, “He was made unto us wisdom.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.vi-p14">Who then is wiser than we are who have not the
wisdom of Plato, but Christ Himself, God having so willed.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.vi-p15">But what means, “of God?” Whenever he speaks
great things concerning the Only-Begotten, he adds mention of the
Father, lest any one should think that the Son is unbegotten.
Since therefore he had affirmed His power to be so great, and had
referred the whole unto the Son, saying that He had “become
wisdom unto us, and righteousness, and sanctification and
redemption;”—through the Son again referring the whole to the
Father, he saith, “of God.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.vi-p16">But why said he not, He hath made us wise, but
“was made unto us wisdom?” To show the copiousness of the
gift. As if he had said, He gave unto us Himself. And observe
how he goes on in order. For first He made us wise by delivering
from error, and then righteous and holy, by giving us the Spirit;
and He hath so delivered us from all our evils as to be “of
Him,” and this is not meant to express communication of being,
(<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.vi-p16.1">οὐσιώσεως</span>) but is spoken
concerning the faith. Elsewhere we find him saying, “We were
made righteousness in Him;” in 
<pb n="25" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_25.html" id="iv.vi-Page_25" />these words, “Him who knew no sin He made to be
sin for us that we might be made the righteousness of God in
Him;” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. v. 21" id="iv.vi-p16.2" parsed="|2Cor|5|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.5.21">2 Cor. v. 21</scripRef>.) but now he saith, “He hath
been made righteousness unto us; so that whosoever will may partake
plentifully.” For it is not this man or that who hath made us
wise, but Christ. “He that glorieth,” therefore, “let him
glory in Him,” not in such or such an one. From Christ have
proceeded all things. Wherefore, having said, “Who was made
unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and
redemption,” he added, “that, according as it is written, he
that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.vi-p17">For this cause also he had vehemently inveighed
against the wisdom of the Greeks, to teach men this lesson, (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.vi-p17.1">τοῦτο  αὐτὸ</span> Savile; <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.vi-p17.2">τούτῳ
αὐτῶ</span> Bened.) and no other: 
that (as indeed is no more than just) they should boast themselves
in the Lord. For when of ourselves we seek the things which are
above us, nothing is more foolish, nothing weaker than we are. In
such case, a tongue well whetted we may have; but stability of
doctrine we cannot have. Rather, reasonings, being alone, are
like the webs of spider. For unto such a point of madness have
some advanced as to say that there is nothing real in the whole of
being: yea, they maintain positively that all things are contrary
to what appears.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.vi-p18">Say not therefore that anything is from thyself, but
in all things glory in God. Impute unto no man anything at any
time. For if unto Paul nothing ought to be imputed much less unto
any others. For, saith he, (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. 3.6" id="iv.vi-p18.1" parsed="|1Cor|3|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.3.6">ch. iii. 6</scripRef>.) “I planted, Apollos
watered, but God gave the increase.” He that hath learnt to
make his boast in the Lord, will never be elated, but will be
moderate at all times, and thankful under all circumstances. But
not such is the mind of the Greeks; they refer all to themselves;
wherefore even of men they make gods. In so great shame hath
desperate arrogance plunged them. (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.vi-p18.2">ἐξετραχήλισεν</span>)</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.vi-p19">[5.] It is time then, in what remains, to go forth
to battle against these. Recollect where we left our discourse on
the former day. We were saying that it was not possible according
to human cause and effect that fishermen should get the better of
philosophers. But nevertheless it became possible: from whence
it is clear that by grace it became so. We were saying that it
was not possible for them even to conceive such great exploits: 
and we shewed that they not only conceived, but brought them to a
conclusion with great ease. Let us handle, to-day, the same head
of our argument: viz. From whence did it enter their thoughts to
expect to overcome the world, unless they had seen Christ after He
was risen? What? Were they beside themselves, to reckon upon
any such thing inconsiderately and at random? For it goes even
beyond all madness, to look, without Divine grace, for success in
so great an undertaking. How did they succeed in it, if they were
insane and frenzied? But if they were in their sober senses, as
indeed the events shewed, how, but on receiving credible pledges
from the heavens and enjoying the influence which is from above,
did they undertake to go forth to so great wars, and to make their
venture against earth and sea, and to strip and stand their ground
so nobly, for a change in the customs of the whole world which had
been so long time fixed, they being but twelve men?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.vi-p20">And, what is more, what made them expect to
convince their hearers, by inviting them to heaven and the mansions
above? Even had they been brought up in honor, and wealth, and
power, and erudition, not even so would it have been at all likely
that they should be roused to so burthensome an undertaking.
However, there would have been somewhat more of reason in their
expectation. But as the case now stands, some of them had been
occupied about lakes, some about hides<note place="end" n="29" id="iv.vi-p20.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi-p21">
That is, some were fishers in the sea or lake of Tiberias, some, as
St. Paul, engaged in making tents out of hides.</p></note>, some about the customs: than
which pursuits nothing is more unprofitable towards philosophy, and
the persuading men to have high imaginations: and especially when
one hath no example to shew. Nay, they had not only no examples
to make their success likely, but they had examples against all
likelihood of success, and those within their own doors.<note place="end" n="30" id="iv.vi-p21.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi-p22">
[Dr. Field prefers the reading, <i>and these
recent</i>.]</p></note>  (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.vi-p22.1">ἔναυλα</span>) 
For many for attempting innovations had been utterly extinguished,
I say not among the Greeks, for all that was nothing, but among the
Jews themselves at that very time; who not with twelve men, but
with great numbers had applied themselves to the work. Thus both
Theudas and Judas, having great bodies of men, perished together
with their disciples. And the fear arising from their examples
was enough to control these, had they not been strongly persuaded
that victory without divine power was out of the question.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.vi-p23">Yea, even if they did expect to prevail, with what
sort of hopes undertook they such great dangers, except they had an
eye to the world to come? But let us suppose that they hoped for
no less than victory; what did they expect to gain from the
bringing all men unto Him, “who is not risen again,” as ye
say? For if now, men who believe concerning the kingdom of heaven
and blessings unnumbered with reluctance encounter dangers, how
could they have undergone so many for nothing, yea rather, for
evil? For if the things which were done did 
<pb n="26" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_26.html" id="iv.vi-Page_26" />not take place, if Christ did not ascend into
heaven; surely in their obstinate zeal to invent these things, and
convince all the world of them, they were offending God, and must
expect ten thousand thunderbolts from on high.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.vi-p24">[6.] Or, in another point of view; if they had
felt this great zeal while Christ was living, yet on His death they
would have let it go out. For He would have seemed to them, had
He not risen, as a sort of deceiver and pretender. Know ye not
that armies while the general and king is alive, even though they
be weak, keep together; but when those in such office have
departed, however strong they may be, they are broken up?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.vi-p25">Tell me then, what were the enticing arguments
whereupon they acted, when about to take hold of the Gospel, and to
go forth unto all the world? Was there any kind of impediment
wanting to restrain them? If they had been mad, (for I will not
cease repeating it,) they could not have succeeded at all; for no
one follows the advice of madmen. But if they succeeded as in
truth they did succeed, and the event proves, then none so wise as
they. Now if none were so wise as they, it is quite plain, they
would not lightly have entered upon the preaching. Had they not
seen Him after He was risen, what was there sufficient to draw them
out unto this war? What which would not have turned them away
from it? He said unto them, “After three days I will rise
again,” and He made promises concerning the kingdom of heaven.
He said, they should master the whole world, after they had
received the Holy Spirit; and ten thousand other things besides
these, surpassing all nature. So that if none of these things had
come to pass, although they believed in Him while alive, after His
death they would not have believed in Him, unless they had seen Him
after He was risen. For they have said, “‘After three
days,’ He said, ‘I will rise again,’ and He hath not
arisen. He promised that He would give the Spirit, and He hath
not sent Him. How then shall His sayings about the other world
find credit with us, when His sayings about this are tried and
found wanting?”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.vi-p26">And why, if He rose not again, did they preach that
He was risen? “Because they loved Him,” you will say. But
surely, it was likely that they would hate Him afterwards, for
deceiving and betraying them; and because, having lifted them up
with innumerable hopes, and divorced them from house, and parents,
and all things, and set in hostility against them the entire nation
of Jews, He had betrayed them after all. And if indeed the thing
were of weakness, they might have pardoned it; but now it would be
deemed a result of exceeding malice. For He ought to have spoken
the truth, and not have promised heaven, being a mortal man, as ye
say. So that the very opposite was the likely line for them to
take; to proclaim the deception, and declare Him a pretender and
imposter. Thus again would they have been rid of all their
perils; thus have put an end to the war. Moreover, seeing that
the Jews gave money unto the soldiers to say that they stole the
body, if the disciples had come forward and said, “We stole Him,
He is not risen again,” what honor would they not have enjoyed? 
Thus it was in their power to be honored, nay, crowned. Why then
did they for insults and dangers barter away these things, if it
was not some Divine power which influenced them, and proved
mightier than all these?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.vi-p27">[7.] But if we do not yet convince, take this also
into consideration; that had this not been so, though they were
ever so well disposed, they would not have preached this Gospel in
His name, but would have treated Him with abhorrence. For ye know
that not even the names of those who deceive us in this sort are we
willing to hear. But for what reason preached they also His
name? Expecting to gain the mastery through Him? Truly the
contrary was natural for them to expect; that even if they had been
on the point of prevailing they were ruining themselves by bringing
forward the name of a deceiver. But if they wished to throw into
the shade former events, their line was to be silent; at any rate,
to contend for them earnestly was to excite more and more both of
serious hostility and of ridicule. From whence then did it enter
their thoughts to invent such things? I say, “invent:” for
what they had heard, they had forgotten. But if, when there was
no fear, they forgot many things, and some did not even understand,
(as also the Evangelist himself saith,) now that so great a danger
came upon them, how could it be otherwise than that all should
fleet away from them? Why speak I of words? when even their love
towards their Master Himself began gradually to fade away, through
fear of what was coming: wherewith also He upbraided them. For
since, before this, they hung upon him, and were asking
continually, “Whither goest Thou,” but afterwards on His
drawing out His discourse to so great length, and declaring the
terrors which at the very time of the Cross, and after the Cross
should befal them, they just continued speechless and frozen
through fear;—hear how He alleges to them this very point saying,
“None of you asketh Me, Whither goest Thou? But because I have
said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart.”
(St. <scripRef passage="John xvi. 5-6" id="iv.vi-p27.1" parsed="|John|16|5|16|6" osisRef="Bible:John.16.5-John.16.6">John xvi. 5–6</scripRef>.) Now if the expectation
that He would die and rise again was such a grief to them, had
<pb n="27" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_27.html" id="iv.vi-Page_27" />they failed to see Him after He
was risen, how could it be less than annihilation? Yea, they
would have been fain to sink into the depths of the earth, what
with dejection at being so deceived, and what with dread of the
future, feeling themselves sorely straightened.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.vi-p28">Again: from whence came their high doctrines? for
the higher points, He said, they should hear afterwards. For,
saith He, (St. <scripRef passage="John xvi. 12" id="iv.vi-p28.1" parsed="|John|16|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.16.12">John xvi.
12</scripRef>.) “I have many
things to speak unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.” So that
the things not spoken were higher. And one of the disciples was
not even willing to depart with Him into Judea, when he heard of
dangers, but said, “Let us also go that we may die with Him,”
(St. <scripRef passage="John xi. 16" id="iv.vi-p28.2" parsed="|John|11|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.11.16">John xi. 16</scripRef>.) taking it hardly<note place="end" n="31" id="iv.vi-p28.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi-p29">
St. Chrys. Hom. 62. on St. John. “All feared the violence
of the Jews, but Thomas more than the rest. Wherefore also he
said, <i>Let us also &amp;c</i>. Some indeed say that he desired
to share our Lord’s death: but it is not so: for it is the
saying rather of a coward. Yet he was not reproved. For as yet
He went on bearing their weakness. Afterwards, however, he (St.
Thomas) became stronger than any, and irreproachable: This being
the great wonder, that one so weak before the time of the Cross,
after the Cross and faith in the Resurrection should be seen more
zealous than all. So great is the power of Christ.”</p></note> because he expected that he should
die. Now if that disciple, while he was with Him, expected to die
and shrunk back on that account, what must he not have expected
afterwards, when parted from Him and the other disciples, and when
the exposure of their shameless conduct was so complete?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.vi-p30">[8.] Besides, what had they to say when they went
forth? For the passion indeed all the world knew: for He had
been hanged on high, upon the frame of wood, (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.vi-p30.1">ἰκρίου</span>) and
in mid-day, and in a chief city, and at a principal feast and that
from which it was least permitted that any should be absent. But
the resurrection no man saw of those who were without: which was
no small impediment to them in working conviction. Again, that He
was buried, was the common talk of all: and that His disciples
stole His body, the soldiers and all the Jews declared: but that
He had risen again, no one of them who were without knew by
sight. Upon what ground then did they expect to convince the
world? For if, while miracles were taking place, certain soldiers
were persuaded to testify the contrary, upon what ground did these
expect without miracles to do the work of preachers, and without
having a farthing to convince land and sea concerning the
resurrection? Again, if through desire of glory they attempted
this, so much the rather would they have ascribed doctrines each
one to himself, and not to Him that was dead and gone. Will it be
said, men would not have believed them? And which of the two was
the likelier, being preached, to win their belief? He that was
apprehended and crucified, or those who had escaped the hands of
the Jews?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.vi-p31">[9.] Next, tell me with what view were they to
take such a course? They did not immediately, leaving Judæa, go
into the Gentile cities, but went up and down within its limit.
But how, unless they worked miracles, did they convince? For if
such they really wrought, (and work them they did,) it was the
result of God’s power. If on the other hand they wrought none
and prevailed, much more wonderful was the event. Knew they not
the Jews—tell me—and their evil practice, and their soul full
of grudgings? For they stoned even Moses, (<scripRef passage="Num. 14.10; Exod. 17.4" id="iv.vi-p31.1" parsed="|Num|14|10|0|0;|Exod|17|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Num.14.10 Bible:Exod.17.4">Numb. xiv. 10. comp. Exod. xvii. 4</scripRef>.) after the sea which they had
crossed on foot; after the victory, and that marvellous trophy
which they raised without blood, by means of his hands, over the
Egyptians who had enslaved them; after the manna; after the rocks,
and the fountains of rivers which break out thence; after ten
thousand miracles in the land of Egypt and the Red Sea and the
wilderness. Jeremiah they cast into a pit, and many of the
prophets they slew. Hear, for example, what saith Elias, after
that fearful famine, and the marvellous rain, and the torch which
he brought down from heaven, and the strange holocaust; driven, as
he was, to the very extreme edge of their country: “Lord, thy
prophets they have killed, thine altars they have digged down, and
I am left alone, and they seek my life.” (<scripRef passage="1 Kings xix. 10" id="iv.vi-p31.2" parsed="|1Kgs|19|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Kgs.19.10">1 Kings xix. 10</scripRef>.) Yet were not those (who
were so persecuted) disturbing any of the established rules. Tell
me then, what ground had men for attending to these of whom we are
speaking? For, on one hand, they were meaner persons than any of
the prophets; on the other, they were introducing just such
novelties as had caused the Jews to nail even their Master to the
Cross.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.vi-p32">And in another way, too, it seemed less
unaccountable for Christ to utter such things than for them; for
He, they might suppose, acted thus to acquire glory for himself;
but these they would have hated even the more, as waging war with
them in behalf of another.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.vi-p33">[10.] But did the laws of the Romans help them? 
Nay, by these they were more involved in difficulties. For their
language was, (St. <scripRef passage="John xix. 12" id="iv.vi-p33.1" parsed="|John|19|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.19.12">John
xix. 12</scripRef>.) “Whosoever
maketh himself a king is not Cæsar’s friend.” So that this
alone was a sufficient impediment to them, that of Him who was
accounted an usurper they were first disciples, and afterwards
desirous to strengthen His cause. What in the world then set them
upon rushing into such great dangers? And by what statements
about Him would they be likely to gain credit? that He was
crucified? That He was born of a poor Jewish woman who had been
betrothed to a Jewish carpenter? That He was of a nation hated by
the world? Nay, all these 
<pb n="28" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_28.html" id="iv.vi-Page_28" />things were enough not only to fail of persuading
and attracting the hearers, but also to disgust every one; and
especially when affirmed by the tent-maker and the fisherman.
Would not the disciples then bear all these things in mind? Timid
nature can imagine more than the reality, and such were their
natures. Upon what ground then did they hope to succeed? Nay,
rather, they had no hope, there being things innumerable to draw
them aside, if so be that Christ had not risen. Is it not quite
plain even unto most thoughtless that unless they had enjoyed a
copious and mighty grace, and had received pledges of the
resurrection, they would have been unable, I say not, to do and
undertake these things, but even so much as to have them in their
minds? For if when there were so great hinderances, in the way of
their planning, I say not of their succeeding, they yet both
planned and brought to effect and accomplishing things greater than
all expectation, every one, I suppose, can see that not by human
power but by divine grace they wrought things.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.vi-p34">Now these arguments we ought to practice, not by
ourselves only, but one with another; and thus also the discovery
of what remains will be easier to us.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.vi-p35">[11.] And do not, because thou art an artisan,
suppose that this sort of exercise is out of your province; for
even Paul was a tent-maker.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.vi-p36">“Yes,” saith some one, “but at that time he
was also filled with abundant grace, and out of that he spake all
things” Well; but before this grace, he was at the feet of
Gamaliel; yea, moreover, and he received the grace, because of
this, that he shewed a mind worthy of the grace; and after these
things he again put his hand to his craft. Let no one, therefore,
of those who have trades be ashamed; but those, who are brought up
to nothing and are idle, who employ many attendants, and are served
by an immense retinue. For to be supported by continual hard work
is a sort of asceticism. (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.vi-p36.1">φιλοσοφίας ?ἶδος</span> comp. Hooker, <i>E. P.</i> V. lxxii.
18.) The souls of such men are clearer, and their minds better
strung. For the man who has nothing to do is apter to say many
things at random, and do many things at random; and he is busy all
day long about nothing, a huge lethargy taking him up entirely.
But he that is employed will not lightly entertain in himself any
thing useless, in deeds, in words, or in thoughts; for his whole
soul is altogether intent upon his laborious way of livelihood.
Let us not therefore despise those who support themselves by the
labor of their own hands; but let us rather call them happy on this
account. For tell me, what thanks are due unto thee, when after
having received thy portion from thy father, thou goest on not in
any calling, but lavishing away the whole of it at random? 
Knowest thou not that we shall not all have to render the same
account, but those who have enjoyed greater licence here a more
exact one; those who were afflicted with labor, or poverty, or any
thing else of this kind, one not so severe? And this is plain
from Lazarus and the rich man. For as thou, for neglecting the
right use of the leisure, art justly accused; so the poor man, who
having full employment hath spent his remnant of time upon right
objects, great will be the crowns which he shall receive. But
dost thou urge that a soldier’s duties should at least excuse
thee; and dost thou charge them with thy want of leisure? The
excuse cannot be founded in reason. For Cornelius was a
centurion, yet in no way did the soldier’s belt impair his strict
rule of life. But thou, when thou art keeping holiday with
dancers and players, and making entire waste of thy life upon the
stage, never thinkest of excusing thyself from such engagements by
the necessity of military service or the fear of rulers: but when
it is the Church to which we call you, then occur these endless
impediments.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.vi-p37">And what wilt thou say in the day, when thou seest
the flame, and the rivers of fire, and the chains never to be
broken; and shalt hear the gnashing of teeth? Who shall stand up
for thee in that day, when thou shalt see him that hath labored
with his own hand and hath lived uprightly, enjoying all glory; but
thyself, who art now in soft raiment and redolent of perfumes, in
incurable woe? What good will thy wealth and superfluity do
thee? And the artisan—what harm will his poverty do him?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.vi-p38">Therefore that we may not suffer then, let us fear
what is said now, and let all our time be spent in employment on
things which are really indispensable. For so, having propitiated
God in regard of our past sins, and adding good deeds for the
future, we shall be able to attain unto the kingdom of heaven: 
through the favor and loving-kindness, etc., etc.</p>

<p class="c27" id="iv.vii-p3">And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with
excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony
of God. For I determined not to know any thing among you, save
Jesus Christ, and Him crucified.</p>

<p class="c24" id="iv.vii-p4"><span class="c18" id="iv.vii-p4.1">Nothing</span> was ever more
prepared for combat than the spirit of Paul; or rather, I should
say, not his spirit, (for he was not himself the inventor of these
things,) but, nothing was ever equal to the grace working within
him, which overcometh all things. For sufficient indeed is what
had been said before to cast down the pride of the boasters about
wisdom; nay, even a part of it had been enough. But to enhance
the splendor of the victory, he contends anew for the points which
he had been affirming; trampling upon the prostrate foe. Look at
it in this way. He had brought forward the prophecy which saith,
“I will destroy the wisdom of the wise.” He had shewn the
wisdom of God, in that by means of what seemed to be foolishness,
He destroyed the philosophy of the Gentiles; he had shewn that the
“foolishness of God is wiser than men;” he had shewn that not
only did He teach by untaught persons, but also chose untaught
persons to learn of Him. Now he sheweth that both the thing
itself which was preached, and the manner of preaching it, were
enough to stagger people; and yet did not stagger them. As
thus: “not only,” saith he, “are the disciples uneducated,
but I myself also, who am the preacher.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.vii-p5">Therefore he saith, “And I, brethren,” (again he
useth the word “brethren,” to smooth down the harshness of the
utterance,) “came not with excellency of speech, declaring unto
you the testimony of God.” “What then? tell me, hadst thou
chosen to come ‘with excellency,’ wouldest thou have been
able?” “I, indeed, had I chosen, should not have been able;
but Christ, if He had chosen, was able. But He would not, in
order that He might render His trophy more brilliant.”
Wherefore also in a former passage, shewing that it was His work
which had been done, His will that the word should be preached in
an unlearned manner, he said, “For Christ sent me not to baptize,
but to preach the Gospel; not with wisdom of words.” But far
greater, yea, infinitely greater, than Paul’s willing this, is
the fact that Christ willed it.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.vii-p6">“Not therefore,” saith he, “by display
of eloquence, neither armed with arguments from without, do I
declare the testimony of God.” He saith not “the
preaching,” but “the testimony<note place="end" n="32" id="iv.vii-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vii-p7">
<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.vii-p7.1">τὸ μαρτύριον</span>, the martyrdom, or
testimony by death: see 
<scripRef passage="1 Tim. ii. 6" id="iv.vii-p7.2" parsed="|1Tim|2|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.2.6">1 Tim. ii. 6</scripRef>.</p></note>
of God;” which word was itself sufficient to withhold him. For
he went about preaching death: and for this reason he added,
“for I determined not to know anything among you, save Jesus
Christ, and Him crucified.” This was the meaning he meant to
convey, that he is altogether destitute of the wisdom which is
without; as indeed he was saying above, “I came not with
excellency of speech:” for that he might have possessed this
also is plain; for he whose garments raised the dead and whose
shadow expelled diseases,<note place="end" n="33" id="iv.vii-p7.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vii-p8">
Here again what is written of St. Peter is taken as if written of
St. Paul: see <scripRef passage="Acts xix. 12; v. 5" id="iv.vii-p8.1" parsed="|Acts|19|12|0|0;|Acts|5|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.19.12 Bible:Acts.5.5">Acts xix.
12; v. 5</scripRef>.</p></note>
much more was his soul capable of receiving eloquence. For this
is a thing which may be taught: but the former transcendeth all
art. He then who knows things beyond the reach of art, much more
must he have had strength for lesser things. But Christ permitted
not; for it was not expedient. Rightly therefore he saith, “For
I determined not to know any thing: “for I, too, for my part
have just the same will as Christ.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.vii-p9">And to me it seems that he speaks to them in a lower
tone even than to any others, in order to repress their pride.
Thus, the expression, “I determined to know nothing,” was
spoken in contradistinction to the wisdom which is without.
“For I came not weaving syllogisms nor sophisms, nor saying unto
you anything else than “Christ was crucified.” They indeed
have ten thousand things to say, and concerning ten thousand things
they speak, winding out long courses of words, framing arguments
and syllogisms, compounding sophisms without end. But I came unto
you saying no other thing than “Christ was crucified,” and all
of them I out-stripped: which is a sign such as no words can
express of the power of Him whom I preach.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.vii-p10"><pb n="30" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_30.html" id="iv.vii-Page_30" />[2.] <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 2.3" id="iv.vii-p10.1" parsed="|1Cor|2|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.2.3">Ver. 3</scripRef>. “And I was with you in
weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.vii-p11">This again is another topic: for not only are the
believers unlearned persons; not only is he that speaketh
unlearned; not only is the manner of the teaching of an unlearned
cast throughout; not only was the thing preached of itself enough
to stagger people; (for the cross and death were the message
brought;) but together with these there were also other hindrances,
the dangers, and the plots, and the daily fear, and the being
hunted about. For the word “weakness,” with him in many
places stands for the persecutions: as also elsewhere. “My
weakness which I had in my flesh ye did not set at nought:”
(<scripRef passage="Gal. iv. 13, 14" id="iv.vii-p11.1" parsed="|Gal|4|13|4|14" osisRef="Bible:Gal.4.13-Gal.4.14">Gal. iv. 13, 14</scripRef>.) and again, “If I must
needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern my
weakness.” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. xi. 30" id="iv.vii-p11.2" parsed="|2Cor|11|30|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.11.30">2 Cor. xi.
30</scripRef>.) What [weakness]? 
“The governor under Aretas the king guarded the city of the
Damascenes, desirous to apprehend me.” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. v. 32" id="iv.vii-p11.3" parsed="|2Cor|5|32|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.5.32">2 Cor. v. 32</scripRef>.) And again, “Wherefore I
take pleasure in weakness:” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. xii. 10" id="iv.vii-p11.4" parsed="|2Cor|12|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.12.10">2 Cor. xii. 10</scripRef>.) then, saying in what, he
added, “In injuries, in necessities, in distresses.” And here
he makes the same statement; for having said, “And I was in
weakness,” etc. he did not stop at this point, but explaining the
word “weakness” makes mention of his dangers. He adds again,
“and in fear, and in much trembling, I was with you.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.vii-p12">“How sayest thou? Did Paul also fear
dangers?” He did fear, and dreaded them excessively; for though
he was Paul, yet he was a man. But this is no charge against
Paul, but infirmity of human nature; and it is to the praise of his
fixed purpose of mind that when he even dreaded death and stripes,
he did nothing wrong because of this fear. So that they who
assert that he feared not stripes, not only do not honor him, but
rather abridge greatly his praises. For if he feared not, what
endurance or what self-restraint was there in bearing the
dangers? I, for my part, on this account admire him; because
being in fear, and not simply in “fear,” but even in
“trembling” at his perils, he so ran as ever to keep his crown;
and gave not in for any danger, in his task of purging out<note place="end" n="34" id="iv.vii-p12.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vii-p13">

sea and land sowing the Gospel.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.vii-p14">[3.] <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 2.4" id="iv.vii-p14.1" parsed="|1Cor|2|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.2.4">Ver. 4</scripRef>. “And my speech and my
preaching was not in persuasive words of wisdom:” that is, had
not the wisdom from without. Now if the doctrine preached had
nothing subtle, and they that were called were unlearned, and he
that preached was of the same description, and thereto was added
persecution, and trembling and fear; tell me, how did they overcome
without Divine power? And this is why, having said, “My speech
and my preaching was not in persuasive words of wisdom,” he
added, “but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.vii-p15">Dost thou perceive how “the foolishness of God is
wiser than men, and the weakness stronger?” They for their
part, being unlearned and preaching such a Gospel, in their chains
and persecution overcame their persecutors. Whereby? was it not
by their furnishing that evidence which is of the Spirit? For
this indeed is confessed demonstration. For who, tell me, after
he had seen dead men rising to life and devils cast out, could have
helped admitting it?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.vii-p16">But seeing that there are also deceiving wonders,
such as those of sorcerers, he removes this suspicion also. For
he said not simply “of power,” but first, “of the Spirit,”
and then, “of power:” signifying that the things done were
spiritual.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.vii-p17">It is no disparagement, therefore, that the Gospel
was not declared by means of wisdom; rather it is a very great
ornament. For this, it will be allowed, is the clearest token of
its being divine and having its roots from above, out of the
heavens. Wherefore he added also,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.vii-p18"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 2.5" id="iv.vii-p18.1" parsed="|1Cor|2|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.2.5">Ver. 5</scripRef>.
“That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in
the power of God.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.vii-p19">Seest thou how clearly in every way he hath set
forth the vast gain of this “ignorance,” and the great loss of
this “wisdom?” For the latter made void the Cross, but the
former proclaimed the power of God: the latter, besides their
failing to discover any of those things which they most needed, set
them also upon boasting of themselves; the former, besides their
receiving the truth, led them also to pride themselves in God.
Again, wisdom would have persuaded many to suspect that the
doctrine was of man: this clearly demonstrated it to be divine,
and to have come down from heaven. Now when demonstration is made
by wisdom of words, even the worse oftentimes overcome the better,
having more skill in words; and falsehood outstrips the truth.
But in this case it is not so: for neither doth the Spirit enter
into an unclean soul, nor, having entered in, can it ever be
subdued; even though all possible cleverness of speech assail it.
For the demonstration by works and signs is far more evident than
that by words.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.vii-p20">[4.] But some one may say perhaps, “If the
Gospel is to prevail and hath no need of words, lest the Cross be
made of none effect; for what reason are signs withholden now?”
For what reason? Speakest thou in unbelief and not allowing that
they were done even in the times of the Apostles, or dost thou
truly seek to know? If in unbelief, I will first make my stand
against <pb n="31" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_31.html" id="iv.vii-Page_31" />this. I say then, If
signs were not done at that time, how did they, chased, and
persecuted, and trembling, and in chains, and having become the
common enemies of the world, and exposed to all as a mark for ill
usage, and with nothing of their own to allure, neither speech, nor
show, nor wealth, nor city, nor nation, nor family, nor pursuit
(<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.vii-p20.1">ἐπιτήδευμα</span>,) nor glory, nor any such like thing;
but with all things contrary, ignorance, meanness, poverty, hatred,
enmity, and setting themselves against whole commonwealths, and
with such a message to declare; how, I say, did they work
conviction? For both the precepts brought much labor, and the
doctrines many dangers. And they that heard and were to obey, had
been brought up in luxury and drunkenness, and in great
wickedness. Tell me then, how did they convince? Whence had
they their credibility? For, as I have just said, If without
signs they wrought conviction, far greater does the wonder
appear. Do not then urge the fact that signs are not done now, as
a proof that they were not done then. For as then they were
usefully wrought; so now are they no longer so wrought.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.vii-p21">Nor doth it necessarily follow from discourse being
the only instrument of conviction, that now the “preaching” is
in “wisdom.” For both they who from the beginning sowed the
word were unprofessional (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.vii-p21.1">ὶδιῶται</span>)
and unlearned, and spake nothing of themselves; but what things
they received from God, these they distributed to the world: and
we ourselves at this time introduce no inventions of our own; but
the things which from them we have received, we speak unto all.
And not even now persuade we by argumentation; but from the Divine
Scriptures and from the miracles done at that time we produce the
proof of what we say. On the other hand, even they at that time
persuaded not by signs alone, but also by discoursing. And the
signs and the testimonies out of the Old Scriptures, not the
cleverness of the things said, made their words appear more
powerful.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.vii-p22">[5.] How then, you will say, is it that signs were
expedient then, and now inexpedient? Let us suppose a case, (for
as yet I am contending against the Greek, and therefore I speak
hypothetically of what must certainly come to pass,) let us, I say,
suppose a case; and let the unbeliever consent to believe our
affirmations, though it be only by way of concession: (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.vii-p22.1">κἄν  κατὰ συνδρομήν</span>) for
instance, That Christ will come. When then Christ shall come and
all the angels with Him, and be manifested as God, and all things
made subject unto Him; will not even the Greek believe? It is
quite plain that he will also fall down and worship, and confess
Him God, though his stubbornness exceed all reckoning. For who,
at sight of the heavens opened and Him coming upon the clouds, and
all the congregation of the powers above spread around Him, and
rivers of fire coming on, and all standing by and trembling, will
not fall down before Him, and believe Him God? Tell me, then;
shall that adoration and knowledge be accounted unto the Greek for
faith? No, on no account. And why not? Because this is not
faith. For necessity hath done this, and the evidence of the
things seen, and it is not of choice, but by the vastness of the
spectacle the powers of the mind are dragged along. It follows
that by how much the more evident and overpowering the course of
events, by so much is the part of faith abridged. For this reason
miracles are not done now.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.vii-p23">And that this is the truth, hear what He saith unto
Thomas (St. <scripRef passage="John xx. 29" id="iv.vii-p23.1" parsed="|John|20|29|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.20.29">John xx.
29</scripRef>.) “Blessed are they
who have not seen, and yet have believed.” Therefore, in
proportion to the evidence wherewith the miracle is set forth is
the reward of faith lessened. So that if now also miracles were
wrought, the same thing would ensue. For that then we shall no
longer know Him by faith, Paul hath shewn, saying, “For now we
walk by faith, not by sight.” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. v. 7" id="iv.vii-p23.2" parsed="|2Cor|5|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.5.7">2 Cor. v. 7</scripRef>. <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.vii-p23.3">νῦν</span> not in the received text.) As at that
time, although thou believe, it shall not be imputed unto thee,
because the thing is so palpable; so also now, supposing that such
miracles were done as were formerly. For when we admit things
which in no degree and in no way can be made out by reasoning, then
it is faith. It is for this that hell is threatened, but is not
shewn: for if it were shewn, the same would again ensue.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.vii-p24">[6.] Besides if signs be what thou seekest after,
even now thou mayest see signs, although not of the same kind; the
numberless predictions and on an endless variety of subject: the
conversion of the world, the self-denying (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.vii-p24.1">φιλοσοφίαν</span>) course of the Barbarians, the
change from savage customs, the greater intenseness of piety.
“What predictions?” you will say. “For all the things just
mentioned were written after the present state of things had
begun.” When? Where? By whom? Tell me. How many years
ago? Will you have fifty, or an hundred? They had not then, a
hundred years ago, anything written at all. How then did the
world retain the doctrines and all the rest, since memory would not
be sufficient? How knew they that Peter was crucified? (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.vii-p24.2">ἀνεσκολοπίσθη</span>)  How could it have entered the
minds of men who came after the events had taken place to foretell,
for instance, that the Gospel should be preached in every part of
the whole world? that the Jewish institutions should cease, and
never return again? And they who 
<pb n="32" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_32.html" id="iv.vii-Page_32" />gave up their lives for the Gospel, how would
they have endured to see the Gospel adulterated? And how would
the writers have won credit, miracles having ceased? And how
could the writings have penetrated to the region of Barbarians, and
of Indians, and unto the very bounds of the ocean, if the relators
had not been worthy of credit? The writers, too, who were they? 
When, how, and why, did they write at all? Was it to gain glory
to themselves? Why then inscribed they the books with other
men’s names? “Why, from a wish to recommend the
doctrine.” As true, or as false? For if you say, they stuck
to it, as being false; their joining it at all was out of all
likelihood: but if as being truth, there was no need of
inventions such as you speak of. And besides, the prophecies are
of such a kind, as that even until now time has been unable to
force aside the predicted course of things: (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.vii-p24.3">ὡς μὴ  δυνάσθαι βιαζὲσθαι
χρόνῳ τα  εἰρημένα</span>) for the destruction indeed of Jerusalem took
place many years ago; but there are also other predictions which
extend along from that time until His coming; which examine as you
please: for instance, this, “I am with you alway, even unto the
end of the world: (St. 
<scripRef passage="Matt. xxviii. 20" id="iv.vii-p24.4" parsed="|Matt|28|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.28.20">Matt. xxviii. 20</scripRef>.) and, “Upon this Rock I
will build My Church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail
against it:” (St. 
<scripRef passage="Matt. xvi. 18" id="iv.vii-p24.5" parsed="|Matt|16|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.16.18">Matt. xvi. 18</scripRef>.) and, “This Gospel shall be
preached unto all nations:” (St. 
<scripRef passage="Matt. xxiv. 14" id="iv.vii-p24.6" parsed="|Matt|24|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.24.14">Matt. xxiv. 14</scripRef>.) and that which the
woman which was an harlot did:<note place="end" n="35" id="iv.vii-p24.7"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vii-p25">
Vid. St. <scripRef passage="Matt. 26.13; Luke 7.37" id="iv.vii-p25.1" parsed="|Matt|26|13|0|0;|Luke|7|37|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.26.13 Bible:Luke.7.37">Matt. xxvi. 13. and comp. St. Luke vii. 37</scripRef>. which two texts St. Chrys.

distinctly says they were not the same. The Fathers are divided
on this point. Tertullian (<i>de Pudic</i>. 11.) and, St.
Augustin (<i>de Consensu Evangelist</i> ii. 79.) consider them as
the same, St. Augustin adding , that she was led to repeat the
action with circumstances that shewed her increased perfection: 
Ambrosiaster (<i>in loc</i>.) leaves the matter
doubtful.</p></note>  and many others more than these.
Whence then the truth of this prediction if indeed it were a
forgery? How did “the gates of hell” not “prevail”
against “the Church?” How is Christ always “with us?”
For had He not been “with us,” the Church would not have been
victorious. How was the Gospel spread abroad in every part of the
world? They also who have spoken against us are enough to testify
the antiquity of the books; I mean, such as Celsus<note place="end" n="36" id="iv.vii-p25.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vii-p26">
Celsus, the Epicurean philosopher, against whom Origen wrote about
A.D. 170.</p></note> and he of Batanea<note place="end" n="37" id="iv.vii-p26.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vii-p27">
Porphyry; so called also by St. Jerome, in the Preface to his
<i>Commentary on Galatians</i> where the Editor’s conjecture is,
that the name was that of Porphyry’s residence or birth, but that
it was also a term of reproach, alluding to the fat bulls of
Basan, <scripRef passage="Ps. xxii. 12" id="iv.vii-p27.1" parsed="|Ps|22|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.22.12">Ps. xxii.
12</scripRef>. He is commonly
called a Tyrian, but they suppose that Batanea, which is in Syria,
was a colony of Tyre.</p></note>, who came after him. For they, I
suppose, were not speaking against books composed after their
time.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.vii-p28">[7] And besides, there is the whole world which
with one consent hath received the Gospel. Now there could not
have been so great agreement from one end of the earth to the
other, unless it had been the Grace of the Spirit; but the authors
of the forgery would have been quickly found out. Neither could
so great excellencies have originated from inventions and
falsehoods. Dost thou not see the whole world coming in; error
extinguished; the austere wisdom (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.vii-p28.1">φιλοσυφίαν</span>) of the old monks shining brighter
than the sun; the choirs of the virgins; the piety among
Barbarians; all men serving under one yoke? For neither by us
alone were these things foretold, but also from the beginning, by
the Prophets. For you will not, I trow, cavil at their
predictions also: for the books are with their enemies, and
through the zeal of certain Greeks they have been transferred into
the Greek tongue. Many things then do these also foretell
concerning these matters, shewing that it was God who should come
among us.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.vii-p29">[8] Why then do not all believe now? Because
things have degenerated: and for this we are to blame. (For
from hence the discourse is addressed unto us also.) For surely
not even then did they trust to signs alone, but by the mode of
life also many of the converts were attracted. For, “Let your
light so shine before men,” saith He, “that they may see your
good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.” (St.
<scripRef passage="Matt. v. 16" id="iv.vii-p29.1" parsed="|Matt|5|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.16">Matt. v. 16</scripRef>.) And, “They were all of
one heart and one soul, neither said any man that aught of the
things which he possessed was his own, but they had all things
common; and distribution was made unto every man, according as he
had need;” (<scripRef passage="Acts iv. 32, 35" id="iv.vii-p29.2" parsed="|Acts|4|32|0|0;|Acts|4|35|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.4.32 Bible:Acts.4.35">Acts iv. 32,
35</scripRef>.) and they lived an
angelic life. And if the same were done now, we should convert
the whole world, even without miracles. But in the meanwhile, let
those who will be saved attend to the Scriptures; for they shall
find there both these noble doings, and those which are greater
than these. For it may be added that the Teachers themselves
surpassed the deeds of the others; living in hunger, in thirst, and
nakedness. But we are desirous of enjoying great luxury, and
rest, and ease; not so they: they cried aloud, “Even unto the
present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are
buffeted, and have no certain dwelling place. (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. iv. 11" id="iv.vii-p29.3" parsed="|1Cor|4|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.4.11">1 Cor. iv. 11</scripRef>.) And some ran from
Jerusalem unto Illyricum, (<scripRef passage="Rom. xv. 19" id="iv.vii-p29.4" parsed="|Rom|15|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.15.19">Rom. xv. 19</scripRef>.) and another unto the country
of the Indians, and another unto that of the Moors, and this to one
part of the world, that to another. Whereas we have not the
courage to depart even out of our own country; but seek for
luxurious living and splendid houses and all other superfluities.
For which of us ever was famished for the word of God’s sake? 
Which ever abode in a wilderness? Which ever 
<pb n="33" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_33.html" id="iv.vii-Page_33" />set out on a distant peregrination? Which of
our teachers lived by the labor of his hands to assist others? 
Which endured death daily? Hence it is that they also who are
with us have become slothful. For suppose that one saw soldiers
and generals struggling with hunger, and thirst, and death, and
with all dreadful things, and bearing cold and dangers and all like
lions, and so prospering; then afterwards, relaxing that
strictness, and becoming enervated, and fond of wealth, and
addicted to business and bargains, and then overcome by their
enemies, it were extreme folly to seek for the cause of all this.
Now let us reason thus in our own case and that of our ancestors;
for we too have become weaker than all, and are nailed down unto
this present life.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.vii-p30">And if one be found having a vestige of the ancient
wisdom, leaving the cities and the market-places, and the society
of the world, and the ordering of others, he betakes himself to the
mountains: and if one ask the reason of that retirement, he
invents a plea which cannot meet with allowance. For, saith he,
“lest I perish too, and the edge of my goodness be taken off, I
start aside.” Now how much better were it for thee to become
less keen, and to gain others, than abiding on high to neglect thy
perishing brethren?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.vii-p31">When, however, the one sort are careless about
virtue, and those who do regard it withdraw themselves far from our
ranks, how are we to subdue our enemies? For even if miracles
were wrought now, who would be persuaded? Or who of those without
would give heed unto us, our iniquity being thus prevalent? For
so it is, that our upright living seems unto the many the more
trustworthy argument of the two: miracles admitting of a bad
construction on the part of obstinate bad men: whereas a pure
life will have abundant power to stop the mouth of the devil
himself.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.vii-p32">[9.] These things I say, both to governors and
governed; and, before all others, unto myself; to the end that the
way of life shown forth in us may be truly admirable, that taking
our appropriate stations, we may look down on all things present;
may despise wealth, and not despise hell; overlook glory, and not
overlook salvation; endure toil and labor here, lest we fall into
punishment there. Thus let us wage war with the Greeks; thus let
us take them captive with a captivity better than liberty.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.vii-p33">But while we say these things without intermission,
over and over, they occur very seldom. Howbeit, be they done or
not, it is right to remind you of them continually. For if some
are engaged in deceiving by their fair speech, so much more is it
the duty of those who allure back unto the truth, not to grow weary
of speaking what is profitable. Again: if the deceivers make
use of so many contrivances—spending as they do money, and
applying arguments, and undergoing dangers, and making a parade of
their patronage—much more should we, who are winning men from
deceit, endure both dangers and deaths, and all things; that we may
both gain ourselves and others, and become to our enemies
irresistible, and so obtain the promised blessings, through the
grace and loving-kindness, etc.</p>

<p class="c24" id="iv.viii-p4"><span class="c18" id="iv.viii-p4.1">Darkness</span> seems to be
more suitable than light to those that are diseased in their
eyesight: wherefore they betake themselves by preference to some
room that is thoroughly shaded over. This also is the case with
the wisdom which is spiritual. As the wisdom which is of God
seemed to be foolishness unto those without: so their own wisdom,
being foolishness indeed, was accounted by them wisdom. The
result has been just as if a man having skill in navigation were to
promise that without a ship or sails he would pass over a boundless
tract of sea, and then endeavor by reasonings to prove that the
thing is possible; but some other person, ignorant of it all,
committing himself to a ship and a steersman and sailors, were thus
to sail in safety. For the seeming ignorance of this man is wiser
than the wisdom of the other. For excellent is the art of
managing a ship; but when it makes too great professions it is a
kind of folly. And so is every art which is not contented with
its own proper limits. Just so the wisdom which is without [were
wisdom indeed<note place="end" n="38" id="iv.viii-p4.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.viii-p5">

spirit. But since it trusted all to itself and supposed that it
wanted none of that help, it became foolishness, although it seemed
to be wisdom. Wherefore having first exposed it by the facts,
then and not till then he calls it foolishness; and having first
called the wisdom of God folly, according to their reckoning, then
and not till then he shews it to be wisdom. (For after our
proofs, not before, we are best able to abash the gainsayers.)</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.viii-p6">His words then are, “Howbeit we speak wisdom among
the perfect:” for when I, accounted foolish and a preacher of
follies, get the better of the wise, I overcome wisdom, not by
foolishness but by a more perfect wisdom; a wisdom, too, so ample
and so much greater, that the other appears foolishness.
Wherefore having before called it by a name such as they named it
at that time, and having both proved his victory from the facts,
and shewn the extreme foolishness of the other side: he
thenceforth bestows upon it its right name, saying, “Howbeit we
speak wisdom among the perfect.” “Wisdom” is the name he
gives to the Gospel, to the method of salvation, the being saved by
the Cross. “The perfect,” are those who believe. For indeed
they are “perfect,” who know all human things to be utterly
helpless, and who overlook them from the conviction that by such
they are profited nothing: such were the true believers.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.viii-p7">“But not a wisdom of this world.” For where is
the use of the wisdom which is without, terminating here and
proceeding no further, and not even here able to profit its
possessors?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.viii-p8">Now by the “rulers of the world,” here, he

philosophers, rhetoricians and writers of speeches (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.viii-p9.2">λογογράφους</span>). For these were the
dominant sort and often became leaders of the people.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.viii-p10">“Rulers of the world” he calls them, because
beyond the present world their dominion extends not. Wherefore,
he adds further, “which are coming to nought;” disparaging it
both on its own account, and from those who wield it. For having
shewn that it is false, that it is foolish, that it can discover
nothing, that it is weak, he shews moreover that it is but of short
duration.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.viii-p11">[2.] “But we speak God’s wisdom in a
mystery.” What mystery? For surely Christ saith, (St. <scripRef passage="Matt. x. 27" id="iv.viii-p11.1" parsed="|Matt|10|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.10.27">Matt. x. 27</scripRef>. <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.viii-p11.2">ηκούσατε</span> rec. text <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.viii-p11.3"> ἀκούετε</span>.) “What ye
have heard in the ear, proclaim upon the housetops.” How then
does he call it “a mystery?” Because that neither angel nor
archangel, nor any other created power knew of it before it
actually took place. Wherefore he saith, (<scripRef passage="Ephes. iii. 10" id="iv.viii-p11.4" parsed="|Eph|3|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Eph.3.10">Ephes. iii. 10</scripRef>) “That now unto the
principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the
Church the manifold wisdom of God.” And this hath God done in
honor to us, so that they not without us should hear the
mysteries. For we, too, ourselves, whomsoever we make our
friends, use to speak of this as a sure proof of friendship towards
them, that we tell our secrets to no one in preference to them.
Let those hear who expose to shame<note place="end" n="40" id="iv.viii-p11.5"><p class="endnote" id="iv.viii-p12">
<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.viii-p12.1">ἐκπομπεύοντες</span>.

the secrets of the Gospel, and unto all indiscriminately display
the “pearls” and the doctrine, and who cast “the holy
things” unto “dogs,” and “swine,” and useless
reasonings. For the Mystery wants no argumentation; but just what
it is, that only is to be declared. Since it will not be a
mystery, divine and whole in all its parts, when thou addest any
thing to it of thyself also.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.viii-p13">And in another sense, too, a mystery is so called;
because we do not behold the things which we see, but some things
we see and others we believe. For such is the nature of our
Mysteries. I, for instance, feel differently upon these subjects
from an unbeliever. I hear, “Christ was crucified;” and
forthwith I admire His loving-kindness unto men: the other hears,
and esteems it weakness. I hear, “He became a servant;” and I
wonder at his care for us: the other hears, and counts it
dishonor. I hear, “He died;” and am astonished at His might,
that being in death He was not holden, but even broke the bands of
death: the other hears, and surmises it to be helplessness. He
hearing of the resurrection, saith, the thing is a legend; I, aware
of the facts which demonstrate it, fall down and worship the
dispensation of God. He hearing of a laver, counts it merely as
water: but I behold not simply the thing which is seen, but the
purification of the soul which is by the Spirit. He considers
only that my body hath been washed; but I have believed that the
soul also hath become both pure and holy; and I count it the
sepulchre, the resurrection, the sanctification, the righteousness,
the redemption, the adoption, the inheritance, the kingdom of
heaven, the plenary effusion (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.viii-p13.1">χορηγίαν</span>) of the Spirit. For not by the sight
do I judge of the things that appear, but by the eyes of the
mind. I hear of the “Body of Christ:” in one sense I
understand the expression, in another sense the unbeliever.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.viii-p14">And just as children, looking on their books, know
not the meaning of the letters, neither know what they see; yea
more, if even a grown man be unskilful in letters, the same thing
will befall him; but the skilful will find 
<pb n="35" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_35.html" id="iv.viii-Page_35" />much meaning stored up in the letters, even
complete lives and histories: and an epistle in the hands of one
that is unskilful will be accounted but paper and ink; but he that
knows how to read will both hear a voice, and hold converse with
the absent, and will reply whatsoever he chooses by means of
writing: so it is also in regard of the Mystery. Unbelievers
albeit they hear, seem not to hear: but the faithful, having the
skill which is by the Spirit, behold the meaning of the things
stored therein. For instance, it is this very thing that Paul
signified, when he said that even now the word preached is
hidden: for “unto them that perish,” he saith, “it is
hidden.” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. iv. 3" id="iv.viii-p14.1" parsed="|2Cor|4|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.4.3">2 Cor. iv.
3</scripRef>.)</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.viii-p15">In another point of view, the word indicates
also the Gospel’s being contrary to all expectation. By no
other name is Scripture wont to call what happens beyond all hope
and above all thought of men. Wherefore also in another place,
“My mystery is for Me<note place="end" n="41" id="iv.viii-p15.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.viii-p16">
This is the rendering, in some old Greek version, though not in the

version runs, “My leanness, my leanness; woe unto me!”
“Mystery” stands for the Chaldee “a secret:” which
meaning the Targum of Jonathan gives to the word in this place: 
as do the Vulgate, and the Syriac according to Walton. The
received reading of the LXX may be explained as a paraphrase of
this rendering. The words, “and for mine,” seem added by St.
Chrysostom.</p></note>,” and for Mine. And Paul again,

mystery: we shall not all sleep, but we shall all be
changed.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.viii-p17">[3.] And though it be everywhere preached, still
is it a mystery; for as we have been commanded, “what things we
have heard in the ear, to speak upon the house tops,” so have we
been also charged, “not to give the holy things unto dogs nor yet
to cast our pearls before swine.” (St. 
<scripRef passage="Matt. vii. 9" id="iv.viii-p17.1" parsed="|Matt|7|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.7.9">Matt. vii. 9</scripRef>.) For some are carnal and do
not understand: others have a veil upon their hearts and do not
see: wherefore that is above all things a mystery, which
everywhere is preached, but is not known of those who have not a
right mind; and is revealed not by wisdom but by the Holy Ghost, so
far as is possible for us to receive it. And for this cause a man
would not err, who in this respect also should entitle it a
mystery, the utterance whereof is forbidden. (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.viii-p17.2">ἀπόῤῥητον</span>)  For not even unto us, the
faithful, hath been committed entire certainty and exactness.
Wherefore Paul also said, (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. 13.9" id="iv.viii-p17.3" parsed="|1Cor|13|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.13.9">ch. xiii. 9</scripRef>.) “We know in part, and we
prophesy in part: for now we see in a mirror darkly; but then
face to face.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.viii-p18">[4.] For this cause he saith, “We speak wisdom
in a mystery, the hidden wisdom which God fore-ordained before the
worlds unto our glory. Hidden:” that is, that no one of the
powers above hath learnt it before us; neither do the many know it
now.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.viii-p19">“Which he fore-ordained unto our glory” and yet,
elsewhere he saith, “unto his own glory,” for he considereth
our salvation to be His own glory: even as also He calleth it His
own riches, (vid. <scripRef passage="Ephes. iii. 8" id="iv.viii-p19.1" parsed="|Eph|3|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Eph.3.8">Ephes.
iii. 8</scripRef>.) though He be
Himself rich in good and need nothing in order that He may be
rich.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.viii-p20">“Fore-ordained,” he saith, pointing out the care
had of us. For so those are accounted most both to honor and to
love us, whosoever shall have laid themselves out to do us good
from the very beginning: which indeed is what fathers do in the
case of children. For although they give not their goods until
afterwards, yet at first and from the beginning they had
predetermined this. And this is what Paul is earnest to point out
now; that God always loved us even from the beginning and when as
yet we were not. For unless He had loved us, He would not have
fore-ordained our riches. Consider not then the enmity which hath
come between; for more ancient than that was the friendship.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.viii-p21">As to the words, “before the worlds,” (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.viii-p21.1">πρὸ  τῶν αἰώνων</span>) they mean
eternal. For in another place also He saith thus, “Who is
before the worlds.” The Son also, if you mark it, will be found
to be eternal in the same sense. For concerning Him he saith,
(<scripRef passage="Heb. i. 2" id="iv.viii-p21.2" parsed="|Heb|1|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Heb.1.2">Heb. i. 2</scripRef>.) “By Him He made the
worlds;” which is equivalent to subsistence before the worlds;
for it is plain that the maker is before the things which are
made.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.viii-p22">[5.] <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 2.8" id="iv.viii-p22.1" parsed="|1Cor|2|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.2.8">Ver. 8</scripRef>. “Which none of the rulers
of this world knew; for had they known, they would not have
crucified the Lord of Glory.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.viii-p23">Now if they knew not, how said He unto them, (St.
<scripRef passage="John vii. 28" id="iv.viii-p23.1" parsed="|John|7|28|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.7.28">John vii. 28</scripRef>.) “Ye both know Me, and ye
know whence I am?” Indeed, concerning Pilate the Scripture
saith, he knew not. (vid. St. 
<scripRef passage="John xix. 9" id="iv.viii-p23.2" parsed="|John|19|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.19.9">John xix. 9</scripRef>.) It is likely also that
neither did Herod know. These, one might say, are called rulers
of this world: but if a man were to say that this is spoken
concerning the Jews also and the Priests, he would not err. For
to these also He saith, (St. 
<scripRef passage="John viii. 19" id="iv.viii-p23.3" parsed="|John|8|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.8.19">John viii. 19</scripRef>.) “Ye know neither Me nor My
Father.” How then saith He a little before, “Ye both know Me,
and ye know whence I am?” However, the manner of this way of
knowledge and of that hath already been declared in the Gospel;
(Hom. 49. on St. John,) and, not to be continually handling the
same topic, thither do we refer our readers.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.viii-p24">What then? was their sin in the matter of the Cross
forgiven them? For He surely did say, “Forgive them.”
(<scripRef passage="Luke xxiii. 34" id="iv.viii-p24.1" parsed="|Luke|23|34|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.23.34">Luke xxiii. 34</scripRef>.) If they repented, it was
forgiven. For even he who set countless assailants on Stephen and
persecuted the Church, even Paul, became the champion of the
Church. Just so then, those others also who 
<pb n="36" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_36.html" id="iv.viii-Page_36" />chose to repent, had forgiveness: and this
indeed Paul himself meant, when he exclaims, (<scripRef passage="Rom. xi. 11, 1, 2" id="iv.viii-p24.2" parsed="|Rom|11|11|0|0;|Rom|11|1|0|0;|Rom|11|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.11.11 Bible:Rom.11.1 Bible:Rom.11.2">Rom. xi. 11, 1, 2</scripRef>.). “I say then, have they
stumbled that they should fall? God forbid.” “I say then,
hath God cast away His people whom He foreknew? God forbid.”
Then, to shew that their repentance was not precluded, he brought
forward as a decisive proof his own conversion, saying, “For I
also am an Israelite.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.viii-p25">As to the words, “They knew not;” they seem to
me to be said here not concerning Christ’s Person, but only
concerning the dispensation hidden in that event: (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.viii-p25.1">περὶ αὐτῆς τοῦ πράγματος  τῆς οἰκονομὶας</span>) as if
he had said, what meant “the death,” and the “Cross,” they
knew not. For in that passage also He said not, “They know not
Me,” but, “They know not what they do;” that is, the
dispensation which is being accomplished, and the mystery, they are
ignorant of. For they knew not that the Cross is to shine forth
so brightly; that it is made the salvation of the world, and the
reconciliation of God unto men; that their city should be taken;
and that they should suffer the extreme of wretchedness.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.viii-p26">By the name of “wisdom,” he calls both Christ,
and the Cross and the Gospel. Opportunely also he called Him,
“The Lord of glory.” For seeing that the Cross is counted a
matter of ignominy, he signifies that the Cross was great glory: 
but that there was need of great wisdom in order not only to know
God but also to learn this dispensation of God: and the wisdom
which was without turned out an obstacle, not to the former only,
but to the latter also.</p>

with “the things which eye hath not seen, nor ear heard.”

and the Prophets which follow after they have all spoken concerning
Him:” and these their words are not entirely extant. Paul,
however, as being learned in the law and speaking by the Spirit,
would of course know all with accuracy. And why speak I of the
captivity? Even before the captivity many books had disappeared;
the Jews having rushed headlong to the last degree of impiety: 
and this is plain from the end of the fourth book of Kings, (<scripRef passage="2 Kings xxii. 8; 2 Chron. xxxiv. 14" id="iv.viii-p30.3" parsed="|2Kgs|22|8|0|0;|2Chr|34|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Kgs.22.8 Bible:2Chr.34.14">2 Kings xxii. 8; 2 Chron. xxxiv.

<p class="c19" id="iv.viii-p32">And besides, there are in many places double
prophecies, easy to be apprehended by the wiser sort; from which we
may find out many of the things which are obscure.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.viii-p33">[7.] What then, hath “eye not seen what God
prepared?” No. For who among men saw the things which were
about to be dispensed? Neither then hath “the ear heard, nor
hath it entered into the heart of man.” How is this? For if
the Prophets spoke of it, how saith he, “Ear hath not heard,
neither hath it entered into the heart of man?” It did not
enter; for not of himself alone is he speaking, but of the whole
human race. What then? The Prophets, did not they hear? Yes,
they heard; but the prophetic ear was not the ear “of man:”
for not as men heard they, but as Prophets. Wherefore he said,
(<scripRef passage="Is. l. 4" id="iv.viii-p33.1" parsed="|Isa|50|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.50.4">Is. l. 4</scripRef>. Sept.) “He hath added unto
me an ear to hear,” meaning by “addition” that which was from
the Spirit. From whence it was plain that before hearing it had
not entered into the heart of man. For after the gift of the
Spirit the heart of the Prophets was not the heart of man, but a
spiritual heart; as also he saith himself, “We have the mind of
Christ” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. 2.16" id="iv.viii-p33.2" parsed="|1Cor|2|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.2.16">v. 16</scripRef>.)
as if he would say, “Before we had the blessing of the Spirit and
learnt the things which no man can speak, no one of us nor yet of
the Prophets conceived them in his mind. How should we? since not
even angels know them. For what need is there to speak,” saith
he, “concerning ‘the rulers of this world,’ seeing that no
man knew them, nor yet the powers above?”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.viii-p34">What kind of things then are these? That by what
is esteemed to be the foolishness of preaching He shall overcome
the world, and the nations shall be brought in, and there shall be
reconciliation of God with men, and so great blessings shall come
upon us!  How then have we “known? Unto us,” he saith,
“God hath revealed them by His Spirit;” 
<pb n="37" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_37.html" id="iv.viii-Page_37" />not by the wisdom which is without; for this like
some dishonored handmaid hath not been permitted to enter in, and
stoop down and look into (see St. 
<scripRef passage="John xx. 5" id="iv.viii-p34.1" parsed="|John|20|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.20.5">John xx. 5</scripRef>.) the mysteries pertaining to
the Lord. Seest thou how great is the difference between this
wisdom and that? The things which angels knew not, these are what
she hath taught us: but she that is without, hath done the
contrary. Not only hath she failed to instruct, but she hindered
and obstructed, and after the event sought to obscure His doings,
making the Cross of none effect. Not then simply by our receiving
the knowledge, does he describe the honor vouchsafed to us, nor by
our receiving it with angels, but, what is more, by His Spirit
conveying it to us.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.viii-p35">[7.] Then to show its greatness, he saith, If the
Spirit which knoweth the secret things of God had not revealed
them, we should not have learned them. Such an object of care was
this whole subject to God, as to be among His secrets. Wherefore
we needed also that Teacher who knoweth these things perfectly; for
“the Spirit,” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. 2.10-12" id="iv.viii-p35.1" parsed="|1Cor|2|10|2|12" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.2.10-1Cor.2.12">v. 10, 11, 12</scripRef>.) saith he, “searcheth all
things, even the deep things of God.” For the word “to
search” is here indicative not of ignorance, but of accurate
knowledge: it is the very same mode of speaking which he used
even of God, saying, “He that searcheth the hearts knoweth what
is the mind of the Spirit.” (<scripRef passage="Rom. viii. 27" id="iv.viii-p35.2" parsed="|Rom|8|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.8.27">Rom. viii. 27</scripRef>.) Then having spoken with
exactness concerning the knowledge of the Spirit, and having
pointed out that it is as fully equal to God’s knowledge, as the
knowledge of a man itself to itself; and also, that we have learned
all things from it and necessarily from it; he added, “which
things also we speak, not in words which man’s wisdom teacheth,
but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with
spiritual.” Seest thou to what point he exalted us because of
the Teacher’s dignity? For so much are we wiser than they as
there is difference between Plato and the Holy Spirit; they having
for masters the heathen rhetoricians but we, the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.viii-p36">[8.] But what is this, “comparing spiritual
things with spiritual?” When a thing is spiritual and of
dubious meaning, we adduce testimonies from the things which are
spiritual. For instance, I say, Christ rose again—was born of a
Virgin; I adduce testimonies and types and demonstrations; the
abode of Jonah in the whale and his deliverance afterwards; the
child-bearing of the barren, Sarah, Rebecca, and the rest; the
springing up of the trees which took place in paradise (<scripRef passage="Gen. ii. 5" id="iv.viii-p36.1" parsed="|Gen|2|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.2.5">Gen. ii. 5</scripRef>.) when there had been no
seeds sown, no rains sent down, no furrow drawn along. For the
things to come were fashioned out and figured forth, as in shadow,
by the former things, that these which are now might be believed
when they came in. And again we shew, how of the earth was man,
and how of man alone the woman; and this without any intercourse
whatever; how the earth itself of nothing, the power of the Great
Artificer being every where sufficient for all things. Thus
“with spiritual things” do I “compare spiritual,” and in no
instance have I need of the Wisdom which is without—neither its
reasonings nor its embellishments. For such persons do but
agitate the weak understanding and confuse it; and are not able to
demonstrate clearly any one of the things which they affirm, but
even have the contrary effect. They rather disturb the mind and
fill it with darkness and much perplexity. Wherefore he saith,
“with spiritual things comparing spiritual.”<note place="end" n="45" id="iv.viii-p36.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.viii-p37">

“What then,” some man will say; “is the wisdom from without

For in this place he calls by the term “wisdom” curious
research and superfluous elegance of words. But should any one
say that he means the human understanding; even in this sense the
fault is thine. For thou bringest a bad name upon it, who makest
a bad use of it; who to the injury and thwarting of God demandest
from it things which indeed it never had. Since then thou
boastest therein and fightest with God, He hath exposed its
weakness. For strength of body also is an excellent thing, but

he is “a natural man,” who attributes every thing to reasonings
of the mind and considers not that he needs help from above; which
is a mark of sheer folly. For God bestowed it that it might learn
and receive help from Him, not that it should consider itself
sufficient unto itself. For eyes are beautiful and useful, but
should they choose to see without light, their beauty profits them
nothing; nor yet their natural force, but even doth harm. So if
you mark it, any soul also, if it choose to see without the Spirit,
becomes even an impediment unto itself.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.viii-p42">“How then, before this,” it will be said, “did
she see all things of herself?” Never at any time did she this
of herself but she had creation for a book set before her in open
view. But when men having left off to walk in the way which God
commanded them, and by the beauty of visible objects to know the
Great Artificer, had entrusted to disputations the leading-staff of
knowledge; they became weak and sank in a sea of ungodliness; for
they presently brought in that which was the abyss of all evil,
asserting that nothing was produced from things which were not, but
from uncreated matter; and from this source they became the parents
of ten thousand heresies.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.viii-p43">Moreover, in their extreme absurdities they agreed;
but in those things wherein they seemed to dream out something
wholesome, though it were only as in shadows, they fell out with
one another; that on both sides they might be laughed to scorn.
For that out of things which are not nothing is produced, nearly
all with one accord have asserted and written; and this with great
zeal. In these absurdities then they were urged on by the
Devil. But in their profitable sayings, wherein they seemed,
though it were but darkly, (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.viii-p43.1">ἐν αἰνίγματι</span>,) to find some part of
what they sought, in these they waged war with one another: for
instance, that the soul is immortal; that virtue needs nothing
external; and that the being good or the contrary is not of
necessity nor of fate.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.viii-p44">Dost thou see the craft of the Devil? If any where
he saw men speaking any thing corrupt, he made all to be of one
mind; but if any where speaking any thing sound, he raised up
others against them; so that the absurdities did not fail, being
confirmed by the general consent, and the profitable parts died
away, being variously understood. Observe how in every respect
the soul is unstrung, (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.viii-p44.1">ἄτονος</span>) and is not sufficient unto
herself. And this fell out as one might expect. For if, being
such as she is, she aspire to have need of nothing and withdraw
herself from God; suppose her not fallen into that condition, and
into what extreme madness would she not have insensibly sunk? If,
endowed with a mortal body, she expected greater things from the
false promise of the Devil—(for, “Ye shall be,” said he,
“as gods” <scripRef passage="Gen. iii. 4" id="iv.viii-p44.2" parsed="|Gen|3|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.3.4">Gen. iii.

extent would she not have cast herself away, had she received her
body also, from the beginning, immortal. For, even after that,
she asserted herself to be unbegotten and of the essence of God,

which gave occasion to her invention of the Grecian gods. On this
account, as it seems to me, God made virtue laborious, with a view
to bow down the soul and to bring it to moderation. And that thou
mayest convince thyself that this is true, (as far as from trifles
ones may guess at any thing great,) let us learn it from the
Israelites. They, it is well known, when they led not a life of
toil but indulged in relaxation, not being able to bear prosperity,
fell away into ungodliness. What then did God upon this? He
laid upon them a multitude of laws with a view to restrain their
licence. And to convince you that these laws contribute not to
any virtue, but were given to them as a sort of curb, providing
them with an occasion of perpetual labor; hear what saith the
prophet concerning them; “I gave them statutes which were not
good.” <scripRef passage="Ezek. xx. 25" id="iv.viii-p45.1" parsed="|Ezek|20|25|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ezek.20.25">Ezek. xx.

good?” Such as did not much contribute towards virtue.
Wherefore he adds also, “and ordinances whereby they shall not

things of the Spirit.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.viii-p47">For as with these eyes no man could learn the things
in the heavens; so neither the soul unaided the things of the
Spirit. And why speak I of the things in heaven? It receives
not even those in earth, all of them. For beholding afar off a
square tower, we think it to be round; but such an opinion is mere
deception of the eyes: so also we may be sure, when a man by
means of his understanding alone examines the things which are afar
off much ridicule will ensue. For not only will he not see them
such as indeed they are, but will even account them the contraries
of what they are. Wherefore he added, “for they are foolishness
unto him.” But this comes not of the nature of the things, but
of his infirmity, unable as he is to attain to their greatness
through the eyes of his soul.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.viii-p48">[11.] Next, pursuing his contrast, he states the
cause of this, saying, “he knoweth not because they are
spiritually discerned:” i.e. the things asserted require faith,
and to apprehend them by reasonings is not possible, for their
<pb n="39" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_39.html" id="iv.viii-Page_39" />magnitude exceeds by a great
deal the meanness of our understanding. Wherefore he saith,
“but he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is
judged of no man.” For he that has sight, beholds himself all
things that appertain to the man that has no sight; but no
sightless person discerns what the other is about. So also in the
case before us, our own matters and those of unbelievers, all of
them we for our part know; but ours, they know not henceforth any
more. We know what is the nature of things present, what the
dignity of things to come; and what some day shall become of the
world when this state of things shall be no more, and what sinners
shall suffer, and the righteous shall enjoy. And that things
present are nothing worth, we both know, and their meanness we
expose; (for to “discern” is also to expose;) (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.viii-p48.1">ἀνακρίνειν, ἐλέγχειν</span>) and that the things to come
are immortal and immoveable. All these things are known to the
spiritual man; and what the natural man shall suffer when he is
departed into that world; and what the faithful shall enjoy when he
hath fulfilled his journey from this: none of which are known to
the natural man.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.viii-p49">[12.] Wherefore also, subjoining a plain
demonstration of what had been affirmed, he saith, “For who hath
known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct Him? But we have
the mind of Christ.” That is to say, the things which are in
the mind of Christ, these we know, even the very things which He
willeth and hath revealed. For since he had said, “the Spirit
had revealed them;” lest any one should set aside the Son, he
subjoins that Christ also shewed us these things. Not meaning
this, that all the things which He knoweth, we know; but that all
the things which we know are not human so as to be open to
suspicion, but of His mind and spiritual.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.viii-p50">For the mind which we have about these things we
have of Christ; that is, the knowledge which we have concerning the
things of the faith is spiritual; so that with reason we are
“judged of no man.” For it is not possible that a natural man
should know divine things. Wherefore also he said, “For who
hath known the mind of the Lord?” implying that our own mind
which we have about these things, is His mind. And this, “that
he may instruct Him,” he hath not added without reason, but with
reference to what he had just now said, “the spiritual man no one
discerneth.” For if no man is able to know the mind of God,
much less can he teach and correct it. For this is the meaning
of, “that he may instruct Him.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.viii-p51">Seest thou how from every quarter he repels the
wisdom which is without, and shews that the spiritual man knoweth
more things and greater? For seeing that those reasons, “That
no flesh should glory;” and, “For this cause hath He chosen the
foolish things, that He might confound the wise men;” and,
“Lest the Cross of Christ should be made void:” seemed not to
the unbelievers greatly worthy of credit, nor yet attractive, or
necessary, or useful, he finishes by laying down the principal
reason; because in this way we most easily see from Whom we may
have the means of learning even high things, and things secret, and
things which are above us. For reason was absolutely made of none
effect by our inability to apprehend through Gentile wisdom the
things above us.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.viii-p52">You may observe, too, that it was more advantageous
to learn in this way from the Spirit. For that is the easiest and
clearest of all teaching.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.viii-p53">“But we have the mind of Christ.” That is,
spiritual, divine, that which hath nothing human. For it is not
of Plato, nor of Pythagoras, but it is Christ Himself, putting His
own things into our mind.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.viii-p54">This then, if naught else, let us revere, O beloved,
and let our life shine forth as most excellent; since He also
Himself maketh this a sure proof of great friendship, viz. the
revealing His secrets unto us: where He saith, (St. <scripRef passage="John xv. 15" id="iv.viii-p54.1" parsed="|John|15|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.15.15">John xv. 15</scripRef>.) “Henceforth I call you not
servants, for all ye are My friends; for all things which I have
heard from My Father I have told unto you:” that is, I have had
confidence towards you. Now if this by itself is a proof of
friendship, namely, to have confidence: when it appears that He
has not only confided to us the mysteries conveyed by words, (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.viii-p54.2">τὰ  διὰ ῥημάτων  μυστηρία</span>) but also imparted to us the same conveyed by
works, (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.viii-p54.3">διὰ τῶν ἔργων</span>, i.e. sacramental actions) consider how
vast the love of which this is the fruit. This, if nothing else,
let us revere; even though we will not make any such great account
of hell, yet let it be more fearful than hell to be thankless and
ungrateful to such a friend and benefactor. And not as hired
servants, but as sons and freemen, let us do all things for the
love of our Father; and let us at last cease from adhering to the
world that we may put the Greeks also to shame. For even now
desiring to put out my strength against them, I shrink from so
doing, lest haply, surpass them as we may by our arguments and the
truth of what we teach, we bring upon ourselves much derision from
the comparison of our way of life; seeing that they indeed,
cleaving unto error and having no such conviction, abide by
philosophy, but we do just the contrary. However, I will say
it. For it may be, it may be that in practising how to contend
against them, we shall long as rivals to become better than they in
our mode of life also.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.viii-p55"><pb n="40" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_40.html" id="iv.viii-Page_40" />[14.] I was
saying not long ago, that it would not have entered the Apostles’
thoughts to preach what they did preach, had they not enjoyed
Divine Grace; and that so far from succeeding, they would not even
have devised such a thing. Well then, let us also to-day
prosecute the same subject in our discourse; and let us shew that
it was a thing impossible so much as to be chosen or thought of by
them, if they had not had Christ among them: not because they
were arrayed, the weak against the strong, not because few against
many, not because poor against rich, not because unlearned against
wise, but because the strength of their prejudice, too, was
great. For ye know that nothing is so strong with men as the
tyranny of ancient custom. So that although they had not been
twelve only, and not so contemptible, and such as they really were,
but another world as large as this, and with an equivalent number
arrayed on their side, or even much greater; even in this case the
result would have been hard to achieve. For the other party had
custom on their side, but to these their novelty was an obstacle.
For nothing so much disturbs the mind, though it be done for some
beneficial purpose, as to innovate and introduce strange things,
and most of all when this is done in matters relating to divine
worship and the glory of God. And how great force there is in
this circumstance I will now make plain; first having made the
following statement that there was added also another difficulty
with regard to the Jews. For in the case of the Greeks, they
destroyed both their gods and their doctrines altogether; but not
so did they dispute with the Jews, but many of their doctrines they
abolished, while the God who had enacted the same they bade them
worship. And affirming that men should honor the legislator, they
said, “obey not in all respects the law which is of Him;” for
instance, in the keeping the Sabbath, or observing circumcision, or
offering sacrifices, or doing any other like thing. So that not
only was custom an impediment, but also the fact, that when they
bade men worship God, they bade them break many of His laws.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.viii-p56">[15.] But in the case of the Greeks great was the
tyranny of custom. For if it had been a custom of ten years only,
I say not of such a length of time, and if it had preoccupied but a
few men, I say not the whole world, when these persons made their
approaches; even in this case the revolution would have been hard
to effect. But now sophists, and orators, and fathers, and
grandfathers, and many more ancient than all these, had been
preoccupied by the error: the very earth and sea, and mountains
and groves, and all nations of Barbarians, and all tribes of the
Greeks, and wise men and ignorant, rulers and subjects, women and
men, young and old, masters and slaves, artificers and husbandmen,
dwellers in cities and in the country; all of them. And those who
were instructed would naturally say, “What in the world is
this? Have all that dwell in the world been deceived? both
sophists and orators, philosophers and historians, the present
generation and they who were before this, Pythagoreans, Platonists,
generals, consuls, kings, they who in all cities from the beginning
were citizens and colonists, both Barbarians and Greeks? And are
the twelve fishermen and tent-makers and publicans wiser than all
these? Why, who could endure such a statement?” However, they
spake not so, nor had it in their mind, but did endure them, and
owned that they were wiser than all. Wherefore they overcame even
all. And custom was no impediment to this, though accounted
invincible when she hath acquired her full swing by course of
time.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.viii-p57">And that thou mayest learn how great is the strength
of custom, it hath oftentimes prevailed over the commands of God.
And why do I say, commands? Even over very blessings. For so
the Jews when they had manna, required garlic; enjoying liberty
they were mindful of their slavery; and they were continually
longing for Egypt, because they were accustomed to it. Such a
tyrannical thing is custom.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.viii-p58">If thou desire to hear of it from the heathens also;
it is said that Plato, although well aware that all about the gods
was a sort of imposture, condescended to all the feasts and all the
rest of it, as being unable to contend with custom; and as having
in fact learnt this from his master. For he, too, being suspected
of some such innovation, was so far from succeeding in what he
desired that he even lost his life; and this, too, after making his
defence. And how many men do we see now by prejudice held in
idolatry, and having nothing plausible to say, when they are
charged with being Greeks, but alleging the fathers, and
grandfathers, and great grandfathers. For no other reason did
some of the heathens call custom, second nature. But when
doctrines are the subject-matter of the custom, it becomes yet more
deeply rooted. For a man would change all things more easily than
those pertaining to religion. The feeling of shame, too, coupled
with custom, was enough to raise an obstacle; and the seeming to
learn a new lesson in extreme old age, and that of those who were
not so intelligent. And why wonder, should this happen in regard
of the soul, seeing that even in the body custom hath great
force?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.viii-p59">[16.] In the Apostles’ case, however, there was
yet another obstacle, more powerful than these; it was not merely
changing custom so ancient and primitive, but there were perils
also <pb n="41" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_41.html" id="iv.viii-Page_41" />under which the change was
effected. For they were not simply drawing men from one custom to
another, but from a custom, wherein was no fear to an undertaking
which held out threats of danger. For the believer must
immediately incur confiscation, persecution, exile from his
country; must suffer the worst ills, be hated of all men, be a
common enemy both to his own people and to strangers. So that
even if they had invited men to a customary thing out of novelty,
even in this case it would have been a difficult matter. But when
it was from a custom to an innovation, and with all these terrors
to boot, consider how vast was the obstacle!</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.viii-p60">And again, another thing, not less than those
mentioned, was added to make the change difficult.  For besides
the custom and the dangers, these precepts were both more
burdensome, and those from which they withdrew men were easy and
light. For their call was from fornication unto chastity; from
love of life unto sundry kinds of death; from drunkenness unto
fasting; from laughter unto tears and compunction; from
covetousness unto utter indigence; from safety unto dangers: and
throughout all they required the strictest circumspection. For,
“Filthiness,” (<scripRef passage="Ephes. v. 4" id="iv.viii-p60.1" parsed="|Eph|5|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Eph.5.4">Ephes.
v. 4</scripRef>.) saith he, “and
foolish talking, and jesting, let it not proceed out of your
mouth.” And these things they spake unto those who knew nothing
else than how to be drunken and serve their bellies; who celebrated
feasts made up of nothing but of “filthiness” and laughter and
all manner of revellings (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.viii-p60.2">κωμῳδίας ἁπάσης</span>.) So that not only from the
matter pertaining to severity of life were the doctrines
burthensome, but also from their being spoken unto men who had been
brought up in careless ease, and “filthiness,” and “foolish
talking,” and laughter and revellings. For who among those who
had lived in these things, when he heard, (<scripRef passage="Matt. x. 38" id="iv.viii-p60.3" parsed="|Matt|10|38|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.10.38">Matt. x. 38</scripRef>.) “If a man take not up his
cross and follow Me, he is not worthy of Me;” and, (<scripRef passage="Matt. 10.34" id="iv.viii-p60.4" parsed="|Matt|10|34|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.10.34">Ibid.
34</scripRef>) “I came not to send
peace but a sword, and to set a man at variance with his father,
and the daughter at variance with her mother,” would not have
felt himself chilled all over (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.viii-p60.5">ἐνάρκησε</span>)? And who, when he heard, “If a man
bid not farewell to home and country and possessions, he is not
worthy of Me,” would not have hesitated, would not have
refused? And yet there were men, who not only felt no chill,
neither shrunk away when they heard these things, but ran to meet
them and rushed upon the hardships, and eagerly caught at the
precepts enjoined. Again, to be told, “For every idle word we
shall give account;” (<scripRef passage="Matt. xii. 36" id="iv.viii-p60.6" parsed="|Matt|12|36|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.12.36">Matt. xii. 36</scripRef>.) and, “whosoever looketh
upon a woman to lust after her, hath committed adultery with her as
soon as seen;” (<scripRef passage="Matt. v. 28, 25" id="iv.viii-p60.7" parsed="|Matt|5|28|0|0;|Matt|5|25|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.28 Bible:Matt.5.25">Matt. v.
28, 25</scripRef>.) and,
“whosoever is angry without cause shall fall into
hell;”—which of the men of that day would not these things have
frightened off? And yet all came running in, and many even leaped
over the boundaries of the course. What then was their
attraction? Was it not, plainly, the power of Him who was
preached? For suppose that the case were not as it is, but just
contrary<note place="end" n="48" id="iv.viii-p60.8"><p class="endnote" id="iv.viii-p61">
i.e. suppose miracles and the attempt to convert had been the other
way, from strictness to ease and pleasure.</p></note>, that this
side was the other, and the other this; would it have been easy,
let me ask, to hold fast and to drag on those who resisted? We
cannot say so. So that in every way that power is proved divine
which wrought so excellently. Else how, tell me, did they prevail
with the frivolous and the dissolute, urging them toward the severe
and rough course of life?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.viii-p62">[17.] Well; such was the nature of the precepts.
But let us see whether the doctrine was attractive. Nay, in this
respect also there was enough to frighten away the unbelievers.
For what said the preachers? That we must worship the crucified,
and count Him as God, who was born of a Jewish woman. Now who
would have been persuaded by these words, unless divine power had
led the way? That indeed He had been crucified and buried, all
men knew; but that He had risen again and ascended, no one save the
Apostles had seen.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.viii-p63">But, you will say, they excited them by promises and
deceived them by an empty sound of words. Nay, this very topic
most particularly shews (even apart from all that has been said)
that our doctrines are no deceit. For all its hardships took
place here, but its consolations they were to promise after the
resurrection. This very thing then, for I repeat it, shews that
our Gospel is divine. For why did no one of the believers say,
“I close not with this, neither do I endure it? Thou
threatenest me with hardships here, and the good things thou
promisest after the resurrection. Why, how is it plain that there
will be a resurrection? Which of the departed hath returned? 
Which of those at rest hath risen again? Which of these hath said
what shall be after our departure hence?” But none of these
things entered into their minds; rather they gave up their very
lives for the Crucified. So that this bare fact was more than
anything a proof of great power; first, their working conviction at
once, touching matters so important, in persons that had never in
their lives before heard of any such thing; secondly, that they
prevailed on them to take the difficulties upon trial, and to
account the blessings as matter of hope. Now if they had been
deceivers they would have done the contrary: their good things
they would have promised as of this world (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.viii-p63.1">ἐντεῦθεν</span>,
so St. <scripRef passage="John xviii. 36" id="iv.viii-p63.2" parsed="|John|18|36|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.18.36">John xviii. 36</scripRef>.); the 
<pb n="42" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_42.html" id="iv.viii-Page_42" />fearful things they would not have mentioned,
whether they related to the present life or the future. For so
deceivers and flatterers act. Nothing harsh, nor galling, nor
burdensome, do they hold out, but altogether the contrary. For
this is the nature of deceit.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.viii-p64">[18.] But “the folly,” it will be said, “of
the greater part caused them to believe what they were told.”
How sayest thou? When they were under Greeks, they were not
foolish; but when they came over to us, did their folly then
begin? And yet they were not men of another sort nor out of
another world, that the Apostles took and persuaded: they were
men too who simply held the opinions of the Greeks, but ours they
received with the accompaniment of dangers. So that if with
better reason they had maintained the former, they would not have
swerved from them, now that they had so long time been educated
therein; and especially as not without danger was it possible to
swerve. But when they came to know from the very nature of the
things that all on that side was mockery and delusion, upon this,
even under menaces of sundry deaths, they sprang off (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.viii-p64.1">ἀπεπήδησαν</span>) from their customary ways, and came
over voluntarily unto the new; inasmuch as the latter doctrine was
according to nature, but the other contrary to nature.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.viii-p65">But “the persons convinced,” it is said, “were
slaves, and woman, and nurses, and midwives, and eunuchs.” Now
in the first place, not of these alone doth our Church consist; and
this is plain unto all. But be it of these; this is what
especially makes the Gospel worthy of admiration; that such
doctrines as Plato and his followers could not apprehend, the
fishermen had power on a sudden to persuade the most ignorant sort
of all to receive. For if they had persuaded wise men only, the
result would not have been so wonderful; but in advancing slaves,
and nurses, and eunuchs unto such great severity of life as to make
them rivals to angels, they offered the greatest proof of their
divine inspiration. Again; had they enjoined I know not what
trifling matters, it were reasonable perhaps to bring forward the
conviction wrought in these persons, to show the trifling nature of
the things which were spoken: but if things great, and high, and
almost transcending human nature, and requiring high thoughts, were
the matter of their lessons of wisdom; the more foolishness thou
showest in those who were convinced, by so much the more dost thou
shew clearly that they who wrought the conviction were wise and
filled with divine grace.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.viii-p66">But, you will say, they prevailed on them through
the excessive greatness of the promises. But tell me, is not this
very thing a wonder to thee, how they persuaded men to expect
prizes and recompenses after death? For this, were there nothing
else, is to me matter of amazement. But this, too, it will be
said, came of folly. Inform me wherein is the folly of these
things: that the soul is immortal; that an impartial tribunal
will receive us after the present life; that we shall render an
account of our deeds and words and thoughts unto God that knoweth
all secrets; that we shall see the evil undergoing punishment, and
the good with crowns on their heads. Nay, these things are not of
folly, but the highest instruction of wisdom. The folly is in the
contrary opinions to these.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.viii-p67">[19.] Were this then the only thing, the despising
of things present, the setting much by virtue, the not seeking
rewards here, but advancing far beyond in hopes, and the keeping
the soul so intent and faithful as by no present terror to be
hindered in respect of the hope of what shall be; tell me, to what
high philosophy must this belong? But would you also learn the
force of the promises and predictions in themselves, and the truth
of those uttered both before and after this present state of
things? Behold, I shew you a golden chain, woven cunningly from
the beginning!  He spake some things to them about Himself, and
about the churches, and about the things to come; and as He spake,
He wrought mighty works. By the fulfilment therefore of what He
said, it is plain that both the wonders wrought were real, and the
future and promised things also.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.viii-p68">But that my meaning may be yet plainer, let me
illustrate it from the actual case. He raised up Lazarus by a
single word merely, and shewed him alive. Again, He said, “The
gates of Hades shall not prevail against the Church (St. <scripRef passage="Matt. xvi. 18" id="iv.viii-p68.1" parsed="|Matt|16|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.16.18">Matt. xvi. 18</scripRef>.) and, “He that forsaketh
father or mother, shall receive an hundred-fold in this life, and
shall inherit everlasting life.” (<scripRef passage="Matt. 19.29" id="iv.viii-p68.2" parsed="|Matt|19|29|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.19.29">ib. 19. 29</scripRef>.) The miracle then is one,
the raising of Lazarus; but the predictions are two; made evident,
the one here, the other in the world to come. Consider now, how
they are all proved by one another. For if a man disbelieve the
resurrection of Lazarus, from the prophecy uttered about the Church
let him learn to believe the miracle. For the word spoken so many
years before, came to pass then, and received accomplishment: for
“the gates of Hades prevailed not against the Church.” You
see that He who spake truth in the prophecy, it is clear that he
also wrought the miracle: and He who both wrought the miracle and
brings to accomplishment the words which He spake, it is clear that
He speaks the truth also in the predictions of things yet to come,
when He saith, “He who despiseth things present shall receive
<pb n="43" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_43.html" id="iv.viii-Page_43" />an hundred-fold, and shall
inherit everlasting life.” For the things which have been
already done and spoken, He hath given as the surest pledges of
those which shall hereafter come to pass.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.viii-p69">Of all these things then, and the like to these,
collecting them together out of the Gospels, let us tell them, and
so stop their mouths. But if any one say, Why then was not error
completely extinguished? this may be our answer: Ye yourselves
are to blame, who rebel against your own salvation. For God hath
so ordered this matter (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.viii-p69.1">ᾠκονόμησεν</span>,) that not even a remnant
of the old impiety need be left.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.viii-p70">[20.] Now, briefly to recount what has been
said: What is the natural course of things? That the weak
should be overcome by the strong, or the contrary? Those who
speak things easy, or things of the harsher sort? those who attract
men with dangers, or with security? innovators, or those who
strengthen custom? those who lead into a rough, or into a smooth
way? those who withdraw men from the institutions of their fathers,
or those who lay down no strange laws? those who promise all their
good things after our departure from this world, or those who
flatter in the present life? the few to overcome the many, or the
many the few?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.viii-p71">But you, too, saith one, gave promises pertaining to
this life. What then have we promised in this life? The
forgiveness of sins and the laver of regeneration. Now in the
first place, baptism itself hath its chief part in things to come;
and Paul exclaims, saying, (<scripRef passage="Col. iii. 4" id="iv.viii-p71.1" parsed="|Col|3|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Col.3.4">Col. iii. 4</scripRef>.) “For ye died, and your
life is hid with Christ in God: when your life shall be
manifested, then shall ye also with Him be manifested in
glory.” But if in this life also it hath advantages, as indeed
it hath, this also is more than all a matter of great wonder, that
they had power to persuade men who had done innumerable evil deeds,
yea such as no one else had done, that they should wash themselves
clean of all, and they should give account of none of their
offences. So that on this very account it were most of all meet
to wonder that they persuaded Barbarians to embrace such a faith as
this, and to have good hopes concerning things to come; and having
thrown off the former burden of their sins, to apply themselves
with the greatest zeal for the time to come to those toils which
virtue requires, and not to gape after any object of sense, but
rising to a height above all bodily things, to receive gifts purely
spiritual: yea, that the Persian, the Sarmatian, the Moor, and
the Indian should be acquainted with the purification of the soul,
and the power of God, and His unspeakable mercy to men, and the
severe discipline of faith, and the visitation of the Holy Spirit,
and the resurrection of bodies, and the doctrines of life
eternal. For in all these things, and in whatever is more than
these, the fishermen, initiating by Baptism divers races of
Barbarians, persuaded them (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.viii-p71.2">φιλοσοφεῖν</span>) to live on high principles.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.viii-p72">Of all these things then, having observed them
accurately, let us speak unto the Gentiles, and again, let us shew
them the evidence of our lives: that by both means we ourselves
may be saved and they drawn over by our means unto the glory of
God. For unto Him be the glory for ever. Amen.</p>

<p class="c27" id="iv.ix-p3">And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto
spiritual, but as unto Carnal, as unto babes in Christ. I fed you
with milk, and not with meat: for ye were not yet able to bear
it; nay, not even now are ye able. For ye are yet carnal.</p>

<p class="c24" id="iv.ix-p4"><span class="c18" id="iv.ix-p4.1">After</span> having overturned the
philosophy which is from without, and cast down all its arrogance,
he comes unto another argument. For it was likely that they would
say, “If we were putting forth the opinions of Plato, or of
Pythagoras, or any other of the philosophers, reason were thou
shouldest draw out such a long discourse against us. But if we
announce the things of the Spirit, for what reason dost thou turn
and toss up and down (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.ix-p4.2">ἄνω  καὶ κάτω στρέφεις</span>)
the wisdom which is from without?”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.ix-p5">Hear then how he makes his stand against this.
“And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto
spiritual.” Why, in the first place, says he, though you had
been perfect in spiritual things also, not even so ought you to be
elated; for what you preach is not your own, nor such as yourselves
have found from your own means. But now even these things ye know
not as ye ought to know them, but ye are learners, and the last of
all. Whether therefore the Gentile wisdom be the occasion of your
high imaginations; that hath been proved to be nothing, nay, <pb n="44" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_44.html" id="iv.ix-Page_44" />in regard to spiritual things to be
even contrary unto us: or if it be on account of things
spiritual, in these, too, ye come short and have your place among
the hindmost. Wherefore he saith, “I could not speak unto you
as unto spiritual.” He said not, “I did not speak,” lest
the thing might seem to proceed from his grudging them somewhat;
but in two ways he brings down their high spirit; first, because
they knew not the things that are perfect; next, because their
ignorance was owing to themselves: yea, in a third way besides
these, by pointing out that “not even now are they able [to bear
it].” For as to their want of ability at first, that perhaps
arose from the nature of the case. In fact, however, he does not
leave them even this excuse. For not through any inability on
their part to receive high doctrines, doth he say they received
them not, but because they were “carnal.” However, in the
beginning this was not so blame-worthy; but that after so long a
time, they had not yet arrived at the more perfect knowledge, this
was a symptom of most utter dulness.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.ix-p6">It may be observed, that he brings the same charge
against the Hebrews, not however, with so much vehemence. For
those, he saith, are such, partly because of tribulation: but
these, because of some appetite for wickedness. Now the two
things are not the same. He implies too, that in the one case he
was intending rebuke, in the other rather stirring them up, when he
spake these words of truth. For to these Corinthians he saith,
“Neither yet now are ye able;” but unto the others (<scripRef passage="Heb. vi. 1" id="iv.ix-p6.1" parsed="|Heb|6|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Heb.6.1">Heb. vi. 1</scripRef>.) “Wherefore let us cease to
speak of the first principles of Christ, and press on unto
perfection:” and again, (<scripRef passage="Heb. 5.9" id="iv.ix-p6.2" parsed="|Heb|5|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Heb.5.9">Ib. v. 9</scripRef>.) “we are persuaded better
things concerning you, and things which accompany salvation, though
we thus speak.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.ix-p7">[2.] And how calleth he those “carnal,” who
had attained so large a measure of the Spirit; and into whose
praises, at the beginning he had entered so much at large? 
Because they also were carnal, unto whom the Lord saith, (St. <scripRef passage="Matt. vii. 22, 23" id="iv.ix-p7.1" parsed="|Matt|7|22|7|23" osisRef="Bible:Matt.7.22-Matt.7.23">Matt. vii. 22, 23</scripRef>.) “Depart from Me, ye
workers of iniquity, I know you not;” and yet they both cast out
devils, and raised the dead, and uttered prophecies. So that it
is possible even for one who wrought miracles to be carnal. For
so God wrought by Balaam, and unto Pharaoh He revealed things to
come, and unto Nebuchadnezzar; and Caiaphas prophesied, not knowing
what he said; yea, and some others cast out devils in His name,
though they were (<scripRef passage="Luke ix. 49" id="iv.ix-p7.2" parsed="|Luke|9|49|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.9.49">Luke ix. 49</scripRef>.) “not with
Him;” since not for the doers’ sake are these things done, but
for others’ sake: nor is it seldom, that those who were
positively unworthy have been made instrumental to them. Now why
wonder, if in the case of unworthy men these things are done for
others’ sake, seeing that so it is, even when they are wrought by
saints? For Paul saith, (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. iii. 22" id="iv.ix-p7.3" parsed="|1Cor|3|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.3.22">1 Cor. iii. 22</scripRef>.) “All things are yours;
whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or life, or death:” and
again, (<scripRef passage="Ephes. iv. 11, 12" id="iv.ix-p7.4" parsed="|Eph|4|11|4|12" osisRef="Bible:Eph.4.11-Eph.4.12">Ephes. iv. 11,
12</scripRef>.) “He gave some
Apostles, and some Prophets, and some Pastors and Teachers, for the
perfecting of the saints, unto the work of ministering.” For if
it were not so, there would have been no security against universal
corruption. For it may be that rulers are wicked and polluted,
and their subjects good and virtuous; that laymen may live in
piety, and priests in wickedness; and there could not have been
either baptism, or the body of Christ, or oblation, through such,
if in every instance grace required merit. But as it is, God uses
to work even by unworthy persons, and in no respect is the grace of
baptism damaged by the conduct of the priest: else would the
receiver suffer loss. Accordingly, though such things happen
rarely, still, it must be owned, they do happen. Now these things
I say, lest any one of the bystanders busying himself about the
life of the priest, should be offended as concerning the things
solemnized (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.ix-p7.5">τὰ τελούμενα</span>). “For man introduceth
nothing into the things which are set before us<note place="end" n="49" id="iv.ix-p7.6"><p class="endnote" id="iv.ix-p8">

Chrysostom’s.</p></note>, but the whole is a work of the
power of God, and He it is who initiates (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.ix-p8.2">ὁ  μυσταγωγῶν</span>) you into the mysteries.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.ix-p9">[3.] “And I, brethren, could not speak unto you
as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal. I fed you with milk, and
not with meat. For ye were not able [to bear it.]”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.ix-p10">For lest he should seem to have spoken ambitiously
(<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.ix-p10.1">φιλοτιμίας  ἕνεκα</span>, to obtain favor)
these things which he hath just spoken; “the spiritual man
judgeth all things,” and, “he himself is judged of no man,”
and, “we have the mind of Christ;” with a view also to repress
their pride: observe what he saith. “Not on this account,”
saith he, “was I silent, because I was not able to tell you more,
but because ‘ye are carnal: neither yet now are ye
able.’”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.ix-p11">Why said he not, “ye are not willing,” but “ye
are not able?” Even because he put the latter for the former.
For as to the want of ability, it arises from the want of will.
Which to them indeed is a matter of accusation, but to their
teacher, of excuse. For if they had been unable by nature, one
might perhaps have been forgiven them; but since it was from
choice, they were bereft of all excuse. He then speaks of the
particular point also which makes them carnal. “For whereas
there is among you strife, and jealousy, and division, are ye not
carnal and walk as men?” Although he had fornications also and
uncleannesses of theirs to speak of, he sets down rather that
offence which <pb n="45" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_45.html" id="iv.ix-Page_45" />he had been a
good while endeavoring to correct. Now if “jealousy” makes
men carnal, it is high time for us to bewail bitterly, and to
clothe ourselves with sackcloth and lie in ashes. For who is pure
from this passion? Except indeed I am but conjecturing the case
of others from myself. If “jealousy” maketh men “carnal,”
and suffereth them not to be “spiritual,” although they
prophesy and show forth other wonderful works; now, when not even
so much grace is with us, what place shall we find for our own
doings; when not in this matter alone, but also in others of
greater moment, we are convicted.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.ix-p12">[4.] From this place we learn that Christ had good
reason for saying, (St. 
<scripRef passage="John iii. 20" id="iv.ix-p12.1" parsed="|John|3|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.3.20">John iii. 20</scripRef>.) “He that doeth evil cometh
not to light;” and that unclean life is an obstacle to high
doctrines, not suffering the clear-sightedness of the understanding
to shew itself. As then it is not in any case possible for a
person in error, but living uprightly, to remain in error; so it is
not easy for one brought up in iniquity, speedily to look up to the
height of the doctrines delivered to us, but he must be clean from
all the passions who is to hunt after the truth: for whoso is
freed from these shall be freed also from his error and attain unto
the truth. For do not, I beseech you, think that abstinence
merely from covetousness or fornication may suffice thee for this
purpose. Not so. All must concur in him that seeketh the
truth. Wherefore saith Peter, (<scripRef passage="Acts x. 34, 35" id="iv.ix-p12.2" parsed="|Acts|10|34|10|35" osisRef="Bible:Acts.10.34-Acts.10.35">Acts x. 34, 35</scripRef>.) “Of a truth I
perceive that God is no respecter of persons; but in every nation
he that feareth Him, and worketh righteousness, is acceptable to
Him:” that is, He calls and attracts him unto the truth.
Seest thou not Paul, that he was more vehement than any one in
warring and persecuting? yet because he led an irreproachable life,
and did these things not through human passion, he was both
received, and reached a mark beyond all. But if any one should
say, “How doth such a one, a Greek, who is kind, and good, and
humane, continue in error?” this would be my answer: He hath
some other passion, vainglory, or indolence of mind, or want of
carefulness about his own salvation, accounting that all things
which concern him are drifted along loosely and at random. <note place="end" n="50" id="iv.ix-p12.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.ix-p13">
[The version of this sentence follows Dr. Field’s text. C.]</p></note>Peter calls the man irreproachable in
all things one that “worketh righteousness,” [and Paul says]
“touching the righteousness which is in the law found
blameless.” Again, “I give thanks to God, whom I serve from
my forefathers with a pure conscience,” (<scripRef passage="2 Tim. i. 3" id="iv.ix-p13.1" parsed="|2Tim|1|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Tim.1.3">2 Tim. i. 3</scripRef>.) How then, you will say,
were unclean persons considered worthy of the Gospel? Because
they wished and longed for it. Thus the one sort, though in
error, are attracted by Him, because they are clean from passions;
the others, of their own accord approaching, are not thrust back.
Many also even from their ancestors have received the true
religion.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.ix-p14">[5.] <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 3.3" id="iv.ix-p14.1" parsed="|1Cor|3|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.3.3">Ver. 3</scripRef>. “For whereas there is
among you jealousy and strife.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.ix-p15">At this point he prepares himself to wrestle with
those whose part was obedience: for in what went before he hath
been casting down the rulers of the Church, where he said that
wisdom of speech is nothing worth. But here he strikes at those
in subjection, in the words,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.ix-p16"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 3.4" id="iv.ix-p16.1" parsed="|1Cor|3|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.3.4">Ver. 4</scripRef>.
“For when one saith, I am Paul, and I of Apollos, are ye not
carnal?”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.ix-p17">And he points out that this, so far from helping
them at all or causing them to acquire any thing, had even become
an obstacle to their profiting in the greater things. For this it
was which brought forth jealousy, and jealousy had made them
“carnal;” and the having become “carnal” left them not at
liberty to hear truths of the sublimer sort.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.ix-p18"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 3.5" id="iv.ix-p18.1" parsed="|1Cor|3|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.3.5">Ver. 5</scripRef>.
“Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos?”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.ix-p19">In this way, after producing and proving his facts,
he makes his accusation henceforth more openly. Moreover, he
employs his own name, doing away all harshness and not suffering
them to be angry at what it is said. For if Paul is nothing and
murmur not, much less ought they to think themselves ill used.
Two ways, you see, he has of soothing them; first by bringing
forward his own person, then by not robbing them of all as if they
contributed nothing. Rather he allows them some small portion: 
small though it be, he does allow it. For having said, “Who is
Paul, and who Apollos,” he adds, “but ministers by whom ye
believed.” Now this in itself is a great thing, and deserving
of great rewards:  although in regard of the archetype and the
root of all good, it is nothing. (For not he that “ministers”
to our blessings, but he that provides and gives them, he is our
Benefactor.) And he said not, “Evangelists,” but
“Ministers,” which is more. For they had not merely preached
the Gospel, but had also ministered unto us; the one being a matter
of word only, while the other hath deed also. And so, if even
Christ be a minister only of good things, and not the root Himself
and the fountain, (I mean, of course, in that He is a Son,) observe
to what an issue this matter is brought. (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.ix-p19.1">ποῦ τὸ
πρᾶγμα  κατάγεται</span>. “how deep
and high it is made to go.”)  How then, you will ask, doth he
say that He “was made a Minister of Circumcision? (<scripRef passage="Rom. xv. 8" id="iv.ix-p19.2" parsed="|Rom|15|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.15.8">Rom. xv. 8</scripRef>.) He is speaking in that
place of His secret dispensation in the Flesh, and not in the same
sense which we have now mentioned. For there, by “Minister,”
he means “Fulfiller,” (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.ix-p19.3">πληρωτὴν</span>, i.e. of types), and not one that of
his own store gives out the blessings.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.ix-p20"><pb n="46" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_46.html" id="iv.ix-Page_46" />Further, he said
not, “Those who guide you into the Faith,” but “those by whom
ye believed;” again attributing the greater share to themselves,
and indicating by this also the subordinate class of ministers
(<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.ix-p20.1">τοὺς διακόνους κὰντεῦθεν  δηλῶν</span>). Now if they were ministering to another, how come
they to seize the authority for themselves? But I would have you
consider how in no wise he lays the blame on them as seizing it for
themselves, but on those who endow them with it. For the
ground-work of the error lay in the multitude; since, had the one
fallen away, the other would have been broken up. Here are two
points which he has skilfully provided for: in that first he hath
prepared, as by mining (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.ix-p20.2">ὑπορύξας,</span>) in
the quarter where it was necessary to overthrow the mischief; and
next, on their side, in not attracting ill-will, nor yet making
them more contentious.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.ix-p21"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 3.5" id="iv.ix-p21.1" parsed="|1Cor|3|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.3.5">Ver. 5</scripRef>.
“Even as Christ (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.ix-p21.2">ὁ</span> <span class="Greek" id="iv.ix-p21.3">Κύριος</span>, rec.
text.) gave to every man.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.ix-p22">For not even this small thing itself was of
themselves, but of God, who put it into their hands. For lest
they might say, What then? are we not to love those that minister
unto us? Yea, saith he; but you should know to what extent. For
not even this thing itself is of them, but of God who gave it.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.ix-p23"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 3.6" id="iv.ix-p23.1" parsed="|1Cor|3|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.3.6">Ver. 6</scripRef>.
“I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the increase.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.ix-p24">That is, I first cast the word into the ground; but,
in order that the seeds might not wither away through temptations,
Apollos added his own part. But the whole was of God.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.ix-p25">[6.] <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 3.7" id="iv.ix-p25.1" parsed="|1Cor|3|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.3.7">Ver. 7</scripRef>. “So then, neither is he
that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth, but God that
giveth the increase.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.ix-p26">Do you observe the manner in which he soothes them,
so that they should not be too much irritated, on hearing, “Who
is this person,” and “Who is that?” “Nay, both are
invidious, namely, both the saying, ‘Who is this person? Who
the other,’” and the saying, that “neither he that planteth
nor he that watereth is any thing.” How then does he soften
these expressions? First, By attaching the contempt to his own
person, “Who is Paul, and who Apollos?” and next, by referring
the whole to God who gave all things. For after he had said,
“Such a person planted,” and added, “He that planteth is
nothing,” he subjoined, “but God that giveth the increase.”
Nor does he stop even here, but applies again another healing
clause, in the words.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.ix-p27"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 3.8" id="iv.ix-p27.1" parsed="|1Cor|3|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.3.8">Ver. 8</scripRef>.
“He that planteth and he that watereth, are one.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.ix-p28">For by means of this he establishes another point
also, viz. that they should not be exalted one against another.
His assertion, that they are one, refers to their inability to do
any thing without “God that giveth the increase.” And thus
saying, he permitted not either those who labored much to lift
themselves up against those who had contributed less; nor these
again to envy the former. In the next place, since this had a
tendency to make men more indolent, I mean, all being esteemed as
one, whether they have labored much or little; observe how he sets
this right, saying, “But each shall receive his own reward
according to his own labor.” As if he said, “Fear not,
because I said, Ye are one; for, compared with the work of God,
they are one; howbeit, in regard to labors, they are not so, but
“each shall receive his own reward.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.ix-p29">Then he smooths it still more, having succeeded in
what he wished; and gratifies them, where it is allowed, with
liberality.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.ix-p30"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 3.9" id="iv.ix-p30.1" parsed="|1Cor|3|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.3.9">Ver. 9</scripRef>.
For we are God’s fellow-workers: “ye are God’s husbandry,
God’s building.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.ix-p31">Seest thou how to them also he hath assigned no
small work, having before laid it down that the whole is of God? 
For since he is always persuading them to obey those that have the
rule over them, on this account he abstains from making very light
of their teachers.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.ix-p32">“Ye are God’s husbandry.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.ix-p33">For because he had said, “I planted,” he kept to
the metaphor. Now if ye be God’s husbandry, it is right that
you should be called not from those who cultivate you, but from
God. For the field is not called the husbandman’s, but the
householder’s.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.ix-p34">“Ye are God’s building.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.ix-p35">Again, the building is not the workman’s, but the
master’s. Now if ye be a building, ye must not be forced
asunder: since this were no building. If ye be a farm, ye must
not be divided, but be walled in with a single fence, namely,
unanimity.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.ix-p36"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 3.10" id="iv.ix-p36.1" parsed="|1Cor|3|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.3.10">Ver. 10</scripRef>. “According to the Grace
of God which was given unto me, as a wise master-builder I laid a
foundation.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.ix-p37">In this place he calls himself wise, not exalting
himself, but to give them an ensample, and to point out that this
is a wise man’s part, to lay a foundation. You may observe as
one instance of his modest bearing, that in speaking of himself as
wise, he allowed not this to stand as though it were something of
his own; but first attributing himself entirely unto God, then and
not till then calls himself by that name. For, “according to
the Grace of God,” saith he, “which was given unto me.”
Thus, at once he signifies both that the whole is of God; and that
this most of all is Grace, viz. the not being divided, but resting
on One Foundation.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.ix-p38">[7.] “Another buildeth thereon; but let each man
take heed how he buildeth thereon.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.ix-p39"><pb n="47" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_47.html" id="iv.ix-Page_47" />Here, I think,
and in what follows, he puts them upon their trial concerning
practice, after that he had once for all knit them together and
made them one.</p>

no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.”</p>

261.) he ceases to be a master-builder.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.ix-p42">See how even from men’s common notions he proves
the whole of his proposition. His meaning is this: “I have
preached Christ, I have delivered unto you the foundation. Take
heed how you build thereon, lest haply it be in vainglory, lest
haply so as to draw away the disciples unto men.” Let us not
then give heed unto the heresies. “For other foundation can no
man lay than that which is laid.” Upon this then let us build,
and as a foundation let us cleave to it, as a branch to a vine; and
let there be no interval between us and Christ. For if there be
any interval, immediately we perish. For the branch by its
adherence draws in the fatness, and the building stands because it
is cemented together. Since, if it stand apart it perishes,
having nothing whereon to support itself. Let us not then merely
keep hold of Christ, but let us be cemented to Him, for if we stand
apart, we perish. “For they who withdraw themselves far from
Thee, shall perish;” (<scripRef passage="Ps. lxxiii. 27" id="iv.ix-p42.1" parsed="|Ps|73|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.73.27">Ps. lxxiii. 27</scripRef>. Sept.) so it is said. Let
us cleave then unto Him, and let us cleave by our works. “For
he that keepeth my commandments, the same abideth in Me” (<scripRef passage="John xiv. 21" id="iv.ix-p42.2" parsed="|John|14|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.14.21">John xiv. 21</scripRef>. in substance.) And
accordingly, there are many images whereby He brings us into
union. Thus, if you mark it, He is “the Head,” we are “the
body:” can there be any empty interval between the head and
body? He is “a Foundation,” we “a building:” He “a
Vine,” we “branches:” He “the Bridegroom,” we “the
bride:” He “the Shepherd,” we “the sheep;” He is
“the Way,” we “they who walk therein.” Again, we are “a
temple,” He “the Indweller:” He “the First-Begotten,”
we “the brethren:” He “the Heir,” we “the heirs
together with Him:” He “the Life,” we “the living:”
He “the Resurrection,” we “those who rise again:” He
“the Light,” we “the enlightened.” All these things
indicate unity; and they allow no void interval, not even the
smallest. For he that removes but to a little distance will go on
till he has become very far distant. For so the body, receiving
though it be but a small cut by a sword, perishes: and the
building, though there be but a small chink, falls to decay: and
the branch, though it be but a little while cut off from the root,
becomes useless. So that this trifle is no trifle, but is even
almost the whole. Whensoever then we commit some little fault or
even negligence, let us not overlook that little; since this, being
disregarded, quickly becomes great. So also when a garment hath
begun to be torn and is neglected, it is apt to prolong its rent
all throughout; and a roof, when a few tiles have fallen, being
disregarded, brings down the whole house.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.ix-p43">[8.] These things then let us bear in mind, and
never slight the small things, lest we fall into those which are
great. But if so be that we have slighted them and are come into
the abyss of evils, not even when we are come there let us despond,
lest we fall into recklessness (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.ix-p43.1">καρηβαρίαν</span>). For to emerge from thence
is hard ever after, for one who is not extremely watchful; not
because of the distance alone, but of the very position, too,
wherein we find ourselves. For sin also is a deep, and is wont to
bear down and crush. And just as those who have fallen into a
well cannot with ease get out, but will want others to draw them
up; so also is he that is come into any depth of sins. To such
then we must lower ropes and draw them up. Nay rather, we need
not others only, but ourselves also, that we for our part may
fasten on ourselves and ascend, I say not so much as we have
descended, but much further, if we be willing: for why? God also
helpeth: for He willeth not the death of a sinner so much as his
conversion. Let no one then despair; let no one have the feeling
of the ungodly; for to them properly belongs this kind of sin: 
“an ungodly man having come into any depth of evils, makes light
of it<note place="end" n="51" id="iv.ix-p43.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.ix-p44">
[This is an exact quotation from the Sept. version of <scripRef passage="Prov. xviii. 3" id="iv.ix-p44.1" parsed="|Prov|18|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Prov.18.3">Prov. xviii. 3</scripRef>.]</p></note>.” So that
it is not the multitude of men’s sins which causes their despair,
but their ungodly mind.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.ix-p45">Shouldest thou then have gone all lengths in
wickedness, yet say unto thyself, God is loving unto men and he
desires our salvation: for “though your sins be as scarlet, I
will whiten you as snow,” (<scripRef passage="Is. i. 10" id="iv.ix-p45.1" parsed="|Isa|1|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.1.10">Is. i. 10</scripRef>. Sept.) saith He; and unto the
contrary habit I will change you. Let us not therefore give up in
despair; for to fall is not so grievous, as to lie where we have
fallen; nor to be wounded so dreadful, as after wounds to refuse
healing. “For who shall boast that he has his heart chaste? or
who shall say confidently that he is pure from sin?” (<scripRef passage="Prov. xx. 9" id="iv.ix-p45.2" parsed="|Prov|20|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Prov.20.9">Prov. xx. 9</scripRef>. Sept.) These things I say
not to make you more negligent, but to prevent your despairing.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.ix-p46">Wouldest thou know how good our Master is? The
Publican went up full of ten thousand wickednesses, and saying
only, “Be merciful unto me,” went down justified. (St. <scripRef passage="Luke 18.13,14" id="iv.ix-p46.1" parsed="|Luke|18|13|18|14" osisRef="Bible:Luke.18.13-Luke.18.14">Luke
xviii. <pb n="48" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_48.html" id="iv.ix-Page_48" />13, 14</scripRef>.) Yea, God saith by the
prophet, “Because of sin for some little season I grieved him,
(<scripRef passage="Is. lvii. 17, 18" id="iv.ix-p46.2" parsed="|Isa|57|17|57|18" osisRef="Bible:Isa.57.17-Isa.57.18">Is. lvii. 17, 18</scripRef>. Sept.) and I saw that (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.ix-p46.3">εἶδον δτι</span> not in Sept.) he was
grieved and went sorrowful, and I healed his ways” (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.ix-p46.4">ἰασάμην  αὐτὸν</span>, Sept.) What is there equal to this
loving-kindness? On condition (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.ix-p46.5">ἳνα
στυγνάση</span>. See St. 
<scripRef passage="John viii. 56" id="iv.ix-p46.6" parsed="|John|8|56|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.8.56">John viii. 56</scripRef>. <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.ix-p46.7"> ἳνα  ἴδη τὴν ἡμέραν</span>) of his “being but sorrowful,” so he
speaks, “I forgave him his sins.” But we do not even this: 
wherefore we especially provoke God to wrath. (For he, who by
little things even is made propitious, when He meets not with so
much as these, is of course indignant and exacts of us the last
penalty; for this comes of exceeding contempt.) Who is there, for
instance, that hath ever become melancholy for his sins? Who hath
bemoaned himself? Who hath beaten his breast? Who hath taken
anxious thought? Not one, to my thinking. But days without
number do men weep for dead servants; for the loss of money: 
while as to the soul which we are ruining day by day, we give it
not a thought. How then wilt thou be able to render God
propitious, when thou knowest not even that thou hast sinned?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.ix-p47">“Yea,” saith some one, “I have sinned.”
“Yea,” is thy word to me with the tongue: say it to me with
thy mind, and with the word mourn heavily, that thou mayest have
continual cheerfulness. Since, if we did grieve for our sins, if
we mourned heavily over our offences, nothing else could give us
sorrow, this one pang would expel all kinds of dejection. Here
then is another thing also which we should gain by our thorough
confession; namely, the not being overwhelmed (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.ix-p47.1">βαπτίζεσθαι</span>) with the pains of the present
life, nor puffed up with its splendors. And in this way, again,
we should more entirely propitiate God; just as by our present
conduct we provoke Him to anger. For tell me, if thou hast a
servant, and he, after suffering much evil at the hands of his
fellow-servants, takes no account of any one of the rest, but is
only anxious not to provoke his master; is he not able by this
alone to do away thine anger? But what, if his offenses against
thee are no manner of care to him, while on those against his
fellow-servants he is full of thought; wilt thou not lay on him the
heavier punishment? So also God doeth: when we neglect His
wrath, He brings it upon us more heavily; but when we regard it,
more gently. Yea, rather, He lays it on us no more at all. He
wills that we should exact vengeance of ourselves for our offences,
and thenceforth He doth not exact it Himself. For this is why He
at all threatens punishment; that by fear He may destroy contempt;
and when the threat alone is sufficient to cause fear in us, He
doth not suffer us to undergo the actual trial. See, for
instance, what He saith unto Jeremiah, (<scripRef passage="Jer. vii. 17, 18" id="iv.ix-p47.2" parsed="|Jer|7|17|7|18" osisRef="Bible:Jer.7.17-Jer.7.18">Jer. vii. 17, 18</scripRef>. Sept. transposing the first
and second clauses.) “Seest thou not what they do? Their
fathers light a fire, their children gather sticks together, their
women knead dough.” It is to be feared lest the same kind of
thing be said also concerning us. “Seest thou not what they
do? No one seeketh the things of Christ, but all their own.
Their children run into uncleanness, their fathers into
covetousness and rapine, their wives so far from keeping back their
husbands from the pomps and vanities of life, do rather sharpen
their appetites for them.” Just take your stand in the market
place; question the comers and goers, and not one wilt thou see
hastening upon a spiritual errand, but all running after carnal
things. How long ere we awake from our surfeiting? How long are
we to keep sinking down into deep slumber? Have we not had our
fill of evils?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.ix-p48">[9.] And yet one might think that even without
words experience itself is sufficient to teach you the nothingness
of things present, and their utter meanness. At all events, there
have been men, who, exercising mere heathen wisdom and knowing
nothing of the future, because they had proved the great
worthlessness of present things, have left them on this account
alone. What pardon then canst thou expect to obtain, grovelling
on the ground and not despising the little things and transient for
the sake of the great and everlasting: who also hearest God
Himself declaring and revealing these things unto thee, and hast
such promises from Him? For that things here have no sufficient
power to detain a man, those have shewn who even without any
promise of things greater have kept away from them. For what
wealth did they expect that they came to poverty? There was
none. But it was from their knowing full well that such poverty
is better than wealth. What sort of life did they hope for that
they forsook luxury, and gave themselves up unto severe
discipline? Not any. But they had become aware of the very
nature of things; and perceived that this of the two is more
suitable, both for the strict training of the soul, and for the
health of the body.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.ix-p49">These things then duly estimating, and revolving
with ourselves continually the future blessings, let us withdraw
from this present world that we may obtain that other which is to
come; through the favor and loving kindness of our Lord Jesus
Christ, with Whom to the Father and the Holy Ghost &amp;c.,

sound these things in your ears, where He says, “Charge this
people; (Fors. <scripRef passage="Exod. xix. 10, 20" id="iv.x-p5.2" parsed="|Exod|19|10|0|0;|Exod|19|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Exod.19.10 Bible:Exod.19.20">Exod. xix.

the ministry of the word, we must give pain to our hearers, not
willingly but on compulsion. Nay rather, if you will, we shall
avoid giving you pain. For saith He, (<scripRef passage="Rom. xiii. 3" id="iv.x-p5.5" parsed="|Rom|13|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.13.3">Rom. xiii. 3</scripRef>, in substance.) “if thou do
that which is good, fear not:” so that it is possible for you
to hear me not only without ill-will, but even with pleasure.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.x-p6">As I said then; that it hath no end, Christ has
declared. Paul also saith, in pointing out the eternity of the
punishment, that the sinners “shall pay the penalty of
destruction, and that for ever” (<scripRef passage="2 Thess. i. 9" id="iv.x-p6.1" parsed="|2Thess|1|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Thess.1.9">2 Thess. i. 9</scripRef>.)

fornicators. nor adulterers, nor effeminate, shall inherit the
kingdom of God.” And also unto the Hebrews he saith, (<scripRef passage="Heb. xii. 14" id="iv.x-p6.3" parsed="|Heb|12|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Heb.12.14">Heb. xii. 14</scripRef>.) “Follow peace with all
men, and the sanctification without which no man shall see the
Lord.” And Christ also, to those who said, “In thy Name we
have done many wonderful works,” saith, “Depart from Me, I know
you not, ye workers of iniquity” (St. 
<scripRef passage="Matt. vii. 22" id="iv.x-p6.4" parsed="|Matt|7|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.7.22">Matt. vii. 22</scripRef>.) And the virgins too who
were shut out, entered in no more. And also about those who gave
Him no food, He saith, (St. 
<scripRef passage="Matt. xxv. 46" id="iv.x-p6.5" parsed="|Matt|25|46|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.25.46">Matt. xxv. 46</scripRef>.) “They shall go away into
everlasting punishment.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.x-p7">[2.] And say not unto me, “where is the rule of
justice preserved entire, if the punishment hath no end?”
Rather, when God doeth any thing, obey His decisions and submit not
what is said to human reasonings. But moreover, how can it be any
thing else than just for one who hath experienced innumerable
blessings from the beginning, and then committed deeds worthy of
punishment, and neither by threat nor benefit improved at all, to
suffer punishment? For if thou enquire what is absolute justice;
it was meet that we should have perished immediately from the
beginning, according to the definition of strict justice. Rather
not even then according to the rule of justice only; for the result
would have had in it kindness too, if we had suffered this also.
For when any one insults him that hath done him no wrong, according
to the rule of justice he suffers punishment: but when it is his
benefactor, who, bound by no previous favor, bestowed innumerable
kindnesses, who alone is the Author of his being, who is God, who
breathed his soul into him, who gave ten thousand gifts of grace,
whose will is to take him up into heaven;—when, I say, such an
one, after so great blessings, is met by insult, daily insult, in
the conduct of the other party; how can that other be thought
worthy of pardon? Dost thou not see how He punished Adam for one
single sin?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.x-p8">“Yes,” you will say; “but He had given him
Paradise and caused him to enjoy much favor.” Nay, surely it is
not all as one, for a man to sin in the enjoyment of security and
ease, and in a state of great affliction. In fact, this is the
dreadful circumstance that thy sins are the sins of one not in any
Paradise but amid the innumerable evils of this life; that thou art
not sobered even by affliction, as though one in prison should
still practise his crime. However, unto thee He hath promised
things yet greater than Paradise. But neither hath He given them
now, least He should unnerve thee in the season of conflicts; nor
hath He been silent about them, lest He should quite cast thee down
with thy labors. As for Adam, he committed but 
<pb n="50" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_50.html" id="iv.x-Page_50" />one sin and brought on himself certain death;
whereas we commit ten thousand transgressions daily. Now if he by
that one act brought on himself so great an evil and introduced
death; what shall not we suffer who continually live in sins, and
instead of Paradise, have the expectation of heaven?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.x-p9">The argument is irksome and pains the hearer: were
it only by my own feelings, I know this. For indeed my heart is
troubled and throbs; and the more I see the account of hell
confirmed, the more do I tremble and shrink through fear. But it
is necessary to say these things lest we fall into hell. What
thou didst receive was not paradise, nor trees and plants, but
heaven and the good things in the heavens. Now if he that had
received less was condemned, and no consideration exempted him,
much more shall we who have sinned more abundantly, and have been
called unto greater things, endure the woes without remedy.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.x-p10">Consider, for example, how long a time, but
for one single sin, our race abides in death. Five thousand
years<note place="end" n="52" id="iv.x-p10.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.x-p11">
According to the reckoning of the LXX, in 
<scripRef passage="Gen. 5" id="iv.x-p11.1" parsed="|Gen|5|0|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.5">Gen. 5</scripRef>. which adding 100 years to the
five first generations, and also to the seventh, and making some
slight difference in the lives of Methuselah and Lamech, brings the
date of the flood to A.M. 2242, and that of our Lord’s birth to
5500.</p></note> and more have
passed, and death hath not yet been done away, on account of one
single sin. And we cannot even say that Adam had heard prophets,
that he had seen others punished for sins, and it was meet that he
should have been terrified thereby and corrected, were it only by
the example. For he was at that time first, and alone; but
nevertheless he was punished. But thou canst not have anything of
this sort to advance, who after so many examples art become worse;
to whom so excellent a Spirit hath been vouch-safed, and yet thou
drawest upon thyself not one sin, nor two, nor three, but sins
without number!  For do not, because the sin is committed in a
small moment, calculate that therefore the punishment also must be
a matter of a moment. Seest thou not those men, who for a single
theft or a single act of adultery, committed in a small moment of
time, oftentimes have spent their whole life in prisons, and in
mines, struggling with continual hunger and every kind of death? 
And there was no one to set them at liberty, or to say, “The
offence took place in a small moment of time; the punishment too
should have its time equivalent to that of the sin.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.x-p12">[3.] But, “They are men,” some one will say,
“who do these things; as for God, He is loving unto men.”
Now, first of all, not even men do these things in cruelty, but in
humanity. And God Himself, as “He is loving unto men,” in the
same character doth He punish sins. (<scripRef passage="Sirac. xvi. 12" id="iv.x-p12.1" parsed="|Acts|16|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.16.12">Sirac. xvi. 12</scripRef>.) “For as His mercy is
great, so also is His reproof.” When therefore thou sayest unto
me, “God is loving unto men,” then thou tellest me of so much
the greater reason for punishing: namely, our sinning against
such a Being. Hence also Paul said, (<scripRef passage="Heb. x. 31" id="iv.x-p12.2" parsed="|Heb|10|31|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Heb.10.31">Heb. x. 31</scripRef>.) “It is a fearful thing to
fall into the hands of the living God.” Endure I beseech you,
the fiery force of the words, for perhaps—perhaps you will have
some consolation from hence!  Who among men can punish as God has
punished? when He caused a deluge and entire destruction of a race
so numerous; and again, when, a little while after, He rained fire
from above, and utterly destroyed them all? What punishment from
men can be like that? Seest thou not that the punishment even in
this world is almost eternal? Four thousand years have passed
away, and the punishment of the Sodomites abideth at its height.
For as His mercy is great, so also is His punishment.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.x-p13">Again: if He had imposed any burdensome or
impossible things, one might perhaps have been able to urge
difficulty of the laws: but if they be extremely easy, what can
we say for our not regarding even these? Suppose thou art unable
to fast or to practice virginity; although thou art able if thou
wilt, and they who have been able are a condemnation to us. But,
however, God hath not used this strictness towards us; neither hath
He enjoined these things nor laid them down as laws, but left the
choice to be at the discretion of the hearers. Nevertheless, thou
art able to be chaste in marriage; and thou art able to abstain
from drunkenness. Art thou unable to empty thyself of all thy
goods? Nay surely thou art able; and they who have done so prove
it. But nevertheless He hath not enjoined this, but hath
commanded not to be rapacious, and of our means to assist those who
are in want. But if a man say, I cannot even be content with a
wife only, he deceiveth himself and reasoneth falsely; and they
condemn him who without a wife lives in chastity. But how, tell
me, canst thou help using abusive words? canst thou not help
cursing? Why, the doing these things is irksome, not the
refraining from them. What excuse then have we for not observing
precepts so easy and light? We cannot name any at all. That the
punishment then is eternal is plain from all that hath been
said.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.x-p14">[4.] But since Paul’s saying appears to some to
tell the other way, come let us bring it forward also and search it
out thoroughly. For having said, “If any man’s work abide
which he hath built thereon, he shall receive a reward; and if any
man’s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss,” he adds,
“but himself shall be saved, yet so as through fire.” What
shall we <pb n="51" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_51.html" id="iv.x-Page_51" />say then to this? 
Let us consider first what is “the Foundation,” and what “the
gold,” and what “the precious stones,” and what “the
hay,” and what the “stubble.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.x-p15">“The Foundation,” then, he hath himself plainly
signified to be Christ, saying, “For other foundation can no man
lay than that which is laid, which,” he saith “is Jesus
Christ.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.x-p16">Next, the building seems to me to be actions.
Although some maintain that this also is spoken concerning teachers
and disciples and concerning corrupt heresies: but the reasoning
doth not admit it. For if this be it, in what sense, while “the
work is destroyed,” is the “builder” to be “saved,”
though it be “through fire?” Of right, the author ought
rather of the two to perish; but now it will be found that the
severer penalty is assigned to him who hath been built into the
work. For if the teacher was the cause of the wickedness, he is
worthy to suffer severer punishment: how then shall he be
“saved?” If, on the contrary, he was not the cause but the
disciples became such through their own perverseness, he is no whit
deserving of punishment, no, nor yet of sustaining loss: he, I
say, who builded so well. In what sense then doth he say, “he
shall suffer loss?”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.x-p17">From this it is plain that the discourse is about
actions. For since he means next in course to put out his
strength against the man who had committed fornication, he begins
high up and long beforehand to lay down the preliminaries. For he
knew how while discussing one subject, in the very discourse about
that thing to prepare the grounds of another to which he intends to
pass on. For so in his rebuke for not awaiting one another at
their meals, he laid the grounds of his discourse concerning the
mysteries. And also because now he is hastening on towards the
fornicator, while speaking about the “Foundation,” he adds,
“Know ye not that ye are the Temple of God? and that the Spirit
of God dwelleth in you? If any man destroy (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.x-p17.1">Φθείρη</span>, rec. version, “defile.”) the Temple
of God, him will God destroy.” Now these things, he said, as
beginning now to agitate with fears the soul of him that had been
unchaste.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.x-p18">[5.] <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 3.12" id="iv.x-p18.1" parsed="|1Cor|3|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.3.12">Ver. 12</scripRef>. “If any man build upon
this foundation, gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay,
stubble.” For after the faith there is need of edification: 
and therefore he saith elsewhere, “Edify one another with these
words.” (perhaps <scripRef passage="1 Thes. v. 11; iv. 5" id="iv.x-p18.2" parsed="|1Thess|5|11|0|0;|1Thess|4|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Thess.5.11 Bible:1Thess.4.5">1
Thes. v. 11; iv. 5</scripRef>.) 
For both the artificer and the learner contribute to the
edifying. Wherefore he saith, “But let every man take heed how
he buildeth thereon.” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. iii. 10" id="iv.x-p18.3" parsed="|1Cor|3|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.3.10">1

faith had been the subject of these sayings, the thing affirmed is
not reasonable. For in the faith all ought to be equal, since
“there is but one faith;” (<scripRef passage="Ephes. iv. 5" id="iv.x-p18.4" parsed="|Eph|4|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Eph.4.5">Ephes. iv. 5</scripRef>.) but in goodness of life it
is not possible that all should be the same. Because the faith is
not in one case less, in another more excellent, but the same in
all those who truly believe. But in life there is room for some
to be more diligent, others more slothful; some stricter, and
others more ordinary; that some should have done well in greater
things, others in less; that the errors of some should have been
more grievous, of others less notable. On this account he saith,
“Gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, stubble,—every man’s
work shall be made manifest:”—his conduct; that is what he
speaks of here:—“If any man’s work abide which he built
thereupon, he shall receive a reward; if any man’s work shall be
burned, he shall suffer loss.” Whereas, if the saying related
to disciples and teachers, he ought not to “suffer loss” for
disciples refusing to hear. And therefore he saith, “Every man
shall receive his own reward according to his own labor” not
according to the result, but according to “the labor.” For
what if the hearers gave no heed? Wherefore this passage also
proves that the saying is about actions.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.x-p19">Now his meaning is this: If any man have an
ill life with a right faith, his faith shall not shelter him from
punishment, his work being burnt up. The phrase, “shall be
burned up,” means, “shall not endure the violence of the
fire.” But just as if a man having golden armor on were to pass
through a river of fire, he comes from crossing it all the
brighter; but if he were to pass through it with hay, so far from
profiting, he destroys himself besides; so also is the case in
regard of men’s works. For he doth not say this as if he were
discoursing of material things being burnt up, but with a view of
making their fear more intense, and of shewing how naked of all
defence he is who abides in wickedness. Wherefore he said, “He
shall suffer loss:” lo, here is one punishment: “but he
himself shall be saved, but so as by fire;” lo, again, here is a
second. And his meaning is, “He himself shall not perish in the
same way as his works, passing into nought, but he shall abide in
the fire.<note place="end" n="53" id="iv.x-p19.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.x-p20">
[Few accept this singular explanation. The common view of the
clause is that it means that the man is saved, but as if through
the very flames, i.e., with the greatest difficulty. <scripRef passage="1 Pet. iv. 18" id="iv.x-p20.1" parsed="|1Pet|4|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Pet.4.18">1 Pet. iv. 18</scripRef>. C.]</p></note></p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.x-p21">[6.] “He calleth it, however, “Salvation,”
you will say; why, that is the cause of his adding, “so as by
fire:” since we also used to say, “It is preserved in the
fire,” when we speak of those substances which do not immediately
burn up and become ashes. For do not at sound of the word fire
imagine that <pb n="52" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_52.html" id="iv.x-Page_52" />those who are
burning pass into annihilation. And though he call such
punishment Salvation, be not astonished. For his custom is in
things which have an ill sound to use fair expressions, and in good
things the contrary. For example, the word “Captivity” seems
to be the name of an evil thing, but Paul has applied it in a good
sense, when he says, “Bringing into captivity every thought to
the obedience of Christ.” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. x. 5" id="iv.x-p21.1" parsed="|2Cor|10|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.10.5">2 Cor. x. 5</scripRef>.) And again, to an evil
thing he hath applied a good word, saying, “Sin reigned,”
(<scripRef passage="Rom. v. 21" id="iv.x-p21.2" parsed="|Rom|5|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.5.21">Rom. v. 21</scripRef>.) here surely the term
“reigning” is rather of auspicious sound. And so here in
saying, “he shall be saved,” he hath but darkly hinted at the
intensity of the penalty: as if he had said, “But himself shall
remain forever in punishment.” He then makes an inference,
saying,</p>

the Temple of God?” For since he had discoursed in the section
before, concerning those who were dividing the Church, he
thenceforward attacks him also who had been guilty of uncleanness;
not indeed as yet in plain terms but in a general way; hinting at
his corrupt mode of life and enhancing the sin, by the Gift which
had been already given to him. Then also he puts all the rest to
shame, arguing from these very blessings which they had already: 
for this is what he is ever doing, either from the future or from
the past, whether grievous or encouraging. First, from things
future; “For the day shall declare it, because it is revealed by
fire.” Again, from things already come to pass; “Know ye not
that ye are the Temple of God, and the Spirit of God dwelleth in
you?”</p>

Temple of God, him will God destroy.” Dost thou mark the
sweeping vehemence of his words? However, so long as the person
is unknown, what is spoken is not so invidious, all dividing among
themselves the fear of rebuke.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.x-p24">“Him will God destroy,” that is, will cause him
to perish. And this is not the word of one denouncing a curse,
but of one that prophesieth.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.x-p25">“For the Temple of God is holy:” but he that
hath committed fornication is profane.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.x-p26">Then, in order that he might not seem to spend his
earnestness upon that one, in saying, “for the Temple of God is
holy,” he addeth, “which ye are.”</p>

himself.” This also is in reference to that person, as thinking
himself to be somewhat and flattering himself on wisdom. But that
he might not seem to press on him at great length in a mere
digression; he first throws him into a kind of agony and delivers
him over unto fear, and then brings back his discourse to the
common fault, saying, “If any man among you seemeth to be wise in
this world, let him become a fool, that he may become (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.x-p27.2">γένηται</span>. rec. vers. “be.”)

with that fear the mind not of that unclean person only, but of all
the hearers also: so accurately does he measure the reach of what
he has to say. For what if a man be rich, what if he be noble; he
is viler than all the vile, when made captive by sin. For as if a
man were a king and enslaved to barbarians, he is of all men most
wretched, so also is it in regard to sin: since sin is a
barbarian, and the soul which hath been once taken captive she
knoweth not how to spare, but plays the tyrant to the ruin of all
those who admit her.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.x-p30">[9.] For nothing is so inconsiderate as
sin: nothing so senseless, so utterly foolish and outrageous.
All is overturned and confounded and destroyed by it, wheresoever
it may alight. Unsightly to behold, disgusting and grievous.
And should a painter draw her picture<note place="end" n="56" id="iv.x-p30.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.x-p31">
Compare G. Herbert, <i>Remains</i>, p. 110. ed.
1824.</p></note>, he would not, methinks, err in
fashioning her after this sort. A woman with the form of a beast,
savage, breathing flames, hideous, black; such as the heathen poets
depict their Scyllas. For with ten thousand hands she lays hold
of our thoughts, and comes on unexpected, and tears everything in
pieces, like those dogs that bite slily.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.x-p32">But rather, what need of the painter’s art, when
we should rather bring forward those who are made after sin’s
likeness?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.x-p33">Whom then will ye that we should portray first? 
The covetous and rapacious? And what more shameless than those
eyes? What more immodest, more like a greedy dog? For no dog
keeps his ground with such shameless impudence as he when he is
grasping at all men’s goods. What more polluted than those
hands? What more audacious than that mouth, swallowing all down
and not satisfied? Nay, look not on the countenance and the eyes
as being a man’s. For such looks belong not to the eyes of
men. He seeth not men as men; he seeth not the heaven as
heaven. He does not even lift up his head unto the Lord; but all
is money in his account. The eyes of men are wont to look upon
poor persons in affliction, and to be softened; but these of the
rapacious man, at sight of the poor, glare like wild beasts’.
The eyes of men do not behold other men’s goods as if they were
their own, but rather their <pb n="53" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_53.html" id="iv.x-Page_53" />own
as others; and they covet not the things given to others, but
rather exhaust upon others their own means: but these are not
content unless they take all men’s property. For it is not a
man’s eye which they have, but a wild beast’s. The eyes of
men endure not to see their own body stripped of clothing, (for it
is their own, though in person it belong to others,) but these,
unless they strip every one and lodge all men’s property in their
own home, are never cloyed; yea rather they never have enough.
Insomuch that one might say that their hands are not wild beasts’
only, but even far more savage and cruel than these. For bears
and wolves when they are satiated leave off their kind of eating: 
but these know not any satiety. And yet for this cause God made
us hands, to assist others, not to plot against them. And if we
were to use them for that purpose, better had they been cut off and
we left without them. But thou, if a wild beast rend a sheep, art
grieved; but when doing the same unto one of thine own flesh and
blood, thinkest thou that thy deed is nothing atrocious? How then
canst thou be a man? Seest thou not that we call a thing humane,
when it is full of mercy and loving-kindness? But when a man doth
any thing cruel or savage, inhuman is the title we give to such a
one. You see then that the stamp of man as we portray him is his
showing mercy; of a beast the contrary; according to constant
saying, “Why, is a man a wild beast, or a dog?” (vid. <scripRef passage="2 Kings viii. 13" id="iv.x-p33.1" parsed="|2Kgs|8|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Kgs.8.13">2 Kings viii. 13</scripRef>.) For men relieve poverty;
they do not aggravate it. Again these men’s mouths are the
mouths of wild beasts; yea rather these are the fiercer of the
two. For the words also, which they utter, emit poison, more than
the wild beasts’ teeth, working slaughter. And if one were to
go through all particulars, one should then see clearly how
inhumanity turns those who practise it from men into beasts.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.x-p34">[10.] But were he to search out the mind also of
that sort of people, he would no longer call them beasts only, but
demons. For first, they are full of great cruelty and of hatred
against their “fellow-servant: (St. 
<scripRef passage="Matt. xviii. 33" id="iv.x-p34.1" parsed="|Matt|18|33|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.18.33">Matt. xviii. 33</scripRef>.) and neither is love of the
kingdom there, nor fear of hell; no reverence for men, no pity, no
sympathy: but shamelessness and audacity, and contempt of all
things to come. And unto them the words of God concerning
punishment seem to be a fable, and His threats mirth. For such is
the mind of the covetous man. Since then within they are demons,
and without, wild beasts; yea, worse than wild beasts; where are we
to place such as they are? For that they are worse even than wild
beasts, is plain from this. The beasts are such as they are by
nature: but these, endowed by nature with gentleness, forcibly
strive against nature to train themselves to that which is
savage. The demons too have the plotters among men to help them,
to such an extent that if they had no such aid, the greater part of
their wiles against us would be done away: but these, when such
as they have spitefully entreated are vying with them, still try to
be more spiteful then they. Again, the devil wages war with man,
not with the demons of his own kind: but he of whom we speak is
urgent in all ways to do harm to his own kindred and family, and
doth not even reverence nature.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.x-p35">I know that many hate us because of these words; but
I feel no hatred towards them; rather I pity and bewail those who
are so disposed. Even should they choose to strike, I would
gladly endure it, if they would but abstain from this their savage
mind. For not I alone, but the prophet also with me, banisheth
all such from the family of men saying, (<scripRef passage="Ps. xlix. 20" id="iv.x-p35.1" parsed="|Ps|49|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.49.20">Ps. xlix. 20</scripRef>. Sept. <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.x-p35.2">τοῖς ἀνοήτοις</span>) “Man being in honor hath no

recover: that we may obtain also the blessings to come through

God.</i></p>

<p class="c24" id="iv.xi-p4"><span class="c18" id="iv.xi-p4.1">As</span> I said before, having
launched out before the proper time into accusation of the
fornicator, and having half opened it obscurely in a few words, and
made the man’s conscience to quail, he hastens again to the
battle with heathen wisdom, and to his accusations of those who
were puffed up there-with, and who were dividing the Church: in
order that having added what remained and completed the whole topic
with accuracy, he might thenceforth suffer his tongue to be carried
away with vehement impulse against the unclean person, having had
but a preliminary skirmishing with him in what he had said
before. For this, “Let no man deceive himself,” is the
expression of one aiming chiefly at him and quelling him beforehand
by fear: and the saying about the “stubble,” suits best with
one hinting at him. And so does the phrase, “Know ye not that
ye are the Temple of God, and the Spirit of God dwelleth in
you?” For these two things are most apt to withdraw us from
sin; when we have in mind the punishment appointed for the sin; and
when we reckon up the amount of our true dignity. By bringing
forward then “the hay” and “the stubble,” he terrifies; but
by speaking of the dignity of that noble birth which was theirs, he
puts them to shame; by the former striving to amend the more
insensible kind, by the latter the more considerate.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xi-p5">[2.] “Let no man deceive himself; if any man
thinketh that he is wise in this world, let him become a
fool.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xi-p6">As he bids one become, as it were, dead unto the
world;—and this deadness harms not at all, but rather profits,
being made a cause of life:—so also he bids him become foolish
unto this world, introducing to us hereby the true wisdom. Now he
becomes a fool unto the world, who slights the wisdom from without,
and is persuaded that it contributes nothing towards his
comprehension of the faith. As then that poverty which is
according to God is the cause of wealth, and lowliness, of
exaltation, and to despise glory is the cause of glory; so also the
becoming a fool maketh a man wiser than all. For all, with us,
goes by contraries.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xi-p7">Further: why said he not, “Let him put off
wisdom,” but, “Let him become a fool?” That he might most
exceedingly disparage the heathen instruction. For it was not the
same thing to say, “Lay aside thy wisdom,” and, “become a
fool.” And besides, he is also training people not to be
ashamed at the want of refinement among us; for he quite laughs to
scorn all heathen things. And for the same sort of reason he
shrinks not from the names, trusting as he does to the power of the
things [which he speaks of].</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xi-p8">Wherefore, as the Cross, though counted ignominious,
became the author of innumerable blessings, and the foundation and
root of glory unspeakable; so also that which was accounted to be
foolishness became unto us the cause of wisdom. For as he who
hath learned anything ill, unless he put away the whole, and make
his soul level and clear, and so offer it to him who is to write on
it, will know no wholesome truth for certain; so also in regard of
the wisdom from without. Unless thou turn out the whole and sweep
thy mind clear, and like one that is ignorant yield up thyself unto
the faith, thou wilt know accurately nothing excellent. For so
those also who see imperfectly if they will not shut their eyes and
commit themselves unto others, but will be trusting their own
matters to their own faulty eyesight, they will commit many more
mistakes than those who see not.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xi-p9">But how, you will say, are men to put off this
wisdom? By not acting on its precepts.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xi-p10">[3.] Then, seeing that he bade men so urgently
withdraw themselves from it, he adds the cause, saying, “For the
wisdom of this world is foolishness with God.” For not only it
contributes nothing, but it even hinders. We must then withdraw
ourselves from it, as doing harm. Dost thou mark with what a high
hand he carries off the spoils of victory, having proved that so
far from profiting us at all, it is even an opponent?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xi-p11">And he is not content with his own arguments, but he
has also adduced testimony again, 
<pb n="55" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_55.html" id="iv.xi-Page_55" />saying, “For it is written, (<scripRef passage="Job v. 13" id="iv.xi-p11.1" parsed="|Job|5|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Job.5.13">Job v. 13</scripRef>.) He taketh the wise in their
own craftiness.” By “craftiness,” i.e. by their own arms
getting the better of them. For seeing that they made use of
their wisdom to the doing away of all need of God, by it and no
other thing He refuted them, shewing that they were specially in
need of God. How and by what method? Because having by it
become fools, by it, as was meet, they were taken. For they who
supposed that they needed not God, were reduced to so great a
strait as to appear inferior to fishermen and unlettered persons;
and from that time forth to be unable to do without them.
Wherefore he saith, “In their own craftiness” He took them.
For the saying “I will destroy their wisdom,” was spoken in
regard to its introducing nothing useful; but this, “who taketh
the wise in their own craftiness, with a view of shewing the power
of God.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xi-p12">Next, he declares also the mode in which God took
them, adding another testimony:</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xi-p13"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 3.20" id="iv.xi-p13.1" parsed="|1Cor|3|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.3.20">Ver. 20</scripRef>. “For the Lord,” saith
he, “knoweth the reasonings of men (<scripRef passage="Ps. xciv. 11" id="iv.xi-p13.2" parsed="|Ps|94|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.94.11">Ps. xciv. 11</scripRef>. <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xi-p13.3"> ἀνθρώπων</span> Sept.) that
they are vain.” Now when the Wisdom which is boundless
pronounces this edict concerning them, and declares them to be
such, what other proof dost thou seek of their extreme folly? For
men’s judgments, it is true, in many instances fail; but the
decree of God is unexceptionable and uncorrupt in every case.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xi-p14">[4.] Thus having set up so splendid a trophy of
the judgment from on high, he employs in what follows a certain
vehemence of style, turning it against those who were under his
ministry, (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xi-p14.1">ἀρχομένους</span>) and speaking thus:</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xi-p15"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 3.21" id="iv.xi-p15.1" parsed="|1Cor|3|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.3.21">Ver. 21</scripRef>. “Wherefore let no man
glory in men; for all things are yours.” He comes again to the
former topic, pointing out that not even for their spiritual things
ought they to be highminded, as having nothing of themselves.
“Since then the wisdom from without is hurtful, and the spiritual
gifts were not given by you, what hast thou wherein to boast?”
And in regard to the wisdom from without, “Let no man deceive
himself,” saith he, because they were conceited about a thing
which in truth did more harm than good. But here, inasmuch as the
thing spoken of was really advantageous, “Let no man glory.”
And he orders his speech more gently: “for all things are
yours.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xi-p16"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 3.22" id="iv.xi-p16.1" parsed="|1Cor|3|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.3.22">Ver. 22</scripRef>. “Whether Paul, or
Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things
present, or things to come, all are yours; and ye are Christ’s
and Christ is God’s.” For because he had handled them
sharply, he refreshes them again. And as above he had said,
(<scripRef passage="1 Cor. iii. 9" id="iv.xi-p16.2" parsed="|1Cor|3|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.3.9">1 Cor. iii. 9</scripRef>.) “We are fellow-workers
with God;” and by many other expressions had soothed them: so
here too he saith, “All things are yours;” taking down the
pride of the teachers, and signifying that so far from bestowing
any favor on them, they themselves ought to be grateful to the
others. Since for their sake they were made such as they were,
yea, moreover, had received grace. But seeing that these also
were sure to boast, on this account he cuts out beforehand this
disease too, saying, “As God gave to every man,” (Supr. <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 6.5,6" id="iv.xi-p16.3" parsed="|1Cor|6|5|6|6" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.6.5-1Cor.6.6">vi. 5. 6</scripRef>.) and, “God gave the
increase:” to the end that neither the one party might be
puffed up as bestowers of good; nor the others, on their hearing a
second time, “All things are yours,” be again elated. “For,
indeed, though it were for your sakes, yet the whole was God’s
doing.” And I wish you to observe how he hath kept on
throughout, making suppositions in his own name and that of
Peter.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xi-p17">But what is, “or death?” That even though they
die, for your sakes they die, encountering dangers for your
salvation. Dost thou mark how he again takes down the high spirit
of the disciples, and raises the spirit of the teachers? In fact,
he talks with them as with children of high birth, who have
preceptors, and who are to be heirs of all.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xi-p18">We may say also, in another sense, that both the
death of Adam was for our sakes, that we might be corrected; and
the death of Christ, that we might be saved.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xi-p19">“And ye are Christ’s; and Christ is
God’s.” In one sense “we are Christ’s,” and in another
sense “Christ is God’s,” and in a third sense is “the world
ours.” For we indeed are Christ’s, as his work: “Christ
is God’s,” as a genuine Offspring, not as a work: in which
sense neither is the world ours. So that though the saying is the
same, yet the meaning is different. For “the world is ours,”
as being a thing made for our sakes: but “Christ is God’s,”
as having Him the Author of his being, in that He is Father. And
“we are Christ’s,” as having been formed by Him. Now “if
they are yours,” saith he, “why have ye done what is just
contrary to this, in calling yourselves after their name, and not
after Christ, and God?”</p>

us, as of ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of
God.” After he had cast down their spirit, mark how again he
refreshes it, saying, “as ministers of Christ.” Do not thou
then, letting go the Master, receive a name from the servants and
ministers. “Stewards;” saith he, indicating that we ought not
to give these things unto all, but unto whom it is due, and to whom
it is fitting we should minister.</p>

“Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found
faithful:” that is, that he do not appropriate to himself his
master’s goods, that he do not as a master lay claim for himself
<pb n="56" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_56.html" id="iv.xi-Page_56" />but administer as a steward.
For a steward’s part is to administer well the things committed
to his charge: not to say that his master’s things are his own;
but, on the contrary, that his own are his master’s. Let every
one think on these things, both he that hath power in speech and he
that possesses wealth, namely, that he hath been entrusted with a
master’s goods and that they are not his own; let him not keep
them with himself, nor set them down to his own account; but let
him impute them unto God who gave them all. Wouldest thou see
faithful stewards? Hear what saith Peter, “Why look ye so
earnestly on us, as though by our own power or godliness we had
made this man to walk?” (<scripRef passage="Acts iii. 12" id="iv.xi-p21.2" parsed="|Acts|3|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.3.12">Acts iii. 12</scripRef>.) Unto<note place="end" n="57" id="iv.xi-p21.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xi-p22">

had said, “I labored more abundantly than they all,” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. xv. 10" id="iv.xi-p22.4" parsed="|1Cor|15|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.15.10">1 Cor. xv. 10</scripRef>.) added, “yet not I, but the
grace of God which was with me.” Elsewhere also, setting
himself strongly against the same persons, he said, “For what
hast thou which thou didst not receive?” (C. 
<scripRef passage="1 Cor. 4.7" id="iv.xi-p22.5" parsed="|1Cor|4|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.4.7">iv. 7</scripRef>.) “For thou hast nothing
of thine own, neither wealth, nor speech, nor life itself; for this
also is surely the Lord’s. Wherefore, when necessity calls, do
thou lay down this also. But if thou doatest on life, and being
ordered to lay it down refusest, thou art no longer a faithful
steward.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xi-p23">“And how is it possible, when God calls, to
resist?” Well, that is just what I say too: and on this
account do I chiefly admire the loving-kindness of God, that the
things which He is able, even against thy will, to take from thee,
these He willeth not to be paid in (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xi-p23.1">εἰσενεχθῆναι</span>) by thee unwillingly, that thou
mayest have a reward besides. For instance, He can take away life
without thy consent; but His will is to do so with thy consent,
that thou mayest say with Paul, “I die daily,” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. xv. 31" id="iv.xi-p23.2" parsed="|1Cor|15|31|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.15.31">1 Cor. xv. 31</scripRef>.) He can take away thy glory
without thy consent, and bring thee low: but He will have it from
thee with thine own goodwill, that thou mayest have a recompense.
He can make thee poor, though unwilling, but He will have thee
willingly become such, that He may weave crowns for thee. Seest
thou God’s mercy to man? Seest thou our own brutish
stupidity?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xi-p24">What if thou art come to great dignity, and hast at
any time obtained some office of Church government? Be not
high-minded. Thou hast not acquired the glory, but God hath put
it on thee. As if it were another’s, therefore, use it
sparingly; neither abusing it nor using it upon unsuitable things,
nor puffed up, nor appropriating it unto thyself; but esteem
thyself to be poor and inglorious. For never,—hadst thou been
entrusted with a king’s purple to keep,—never would it have
become thee to abuse the robe and spoil it, but with the more
exactness to keep it for the giver. Is utterance given thee? Be
not puffed up; be not arrogant; for the gracious gift is not
thine. Be not grudging about thy Master’s good, but distribute
them among thy fellow-servants; and neither be thou elated with
these things as if they were thine own, nor be sparing as to the
distribution of them. Again, if thou hast children, they are
God’s which thou hast. If such be thy thought, thou wilt both
be thankful for having them, and if bereft thou wilt not take it
hard. Such was Job when he said, (<scripRef passage="Job i. 21" id="iv.xi-p24.1" parsed="|Job|1|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Job.1.21">Job i. 21</scripRef>) “The Lord gave, the Lord
hath taken away.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xi-p25">For we have all things from Christ. Both existence
itself we have through Him, and life, and breath, and light, and
air, and earth. And if He were to exclude us from any one of
these, we are lost and undone. For (<scripRef passage="1 Pet. 2.11" id="iv.xi-p25.1" parsed="|1Pet|2|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Pet.2.11">1 S. Pet.
ii. 11</scripRef>.) “we are
sojourners and pilgrims.” And all this about “mine,” and
“thine,” is bare words only, and doth not stand for things.
For if thou do but say the house is thine, it is a word without a
reality: since the very air, earth, matter, are the Creator’s;
and so art thou too thyself, who hast framed it; and all other
things also. But supposing the use to be thine, even this is
uncertain, not on account of death alone, but also before death,
because of the instability of things.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xi-p26">[6.] These things then continually picturing to
ourselves, let us lead strict lives; and we shall gain two of the
greatest advantages. For first, we shall be thankful both when we
have and when we are bereaved; and we shall not be enslaved to
things which are fleeting by, and things not our own. For whether
it be wealth that He taketh, He hath taken but His own; or honor,
or glory, or the body, or the life itself: be it that He taketh
away thy son, it is not thy son that He hath taken, but His own
servant. For thou formedst him not, but He made him. Thou didst
but minister to his appearing; the whole was God’s own work.
Let us give thanks therefore that we have been counted worthy to be
His ministers in this matter. But what? Wouldest thou have had
him for ever? This again proves thee grudging, and ignorant that
it was another’s child which thou hadst, and not thine own. As
therefore those who part resignedly are but aware that they have
what was not theirs; so whoever gives way to grief is in fact
counting the King’s property his own. For, if we are not our
own, how can they be ours? I say, we: for in two ways we are
His, both on <pb n="57" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_57.html" id="iv.xi-Page_57" />account of our
creation, and also on account of the faith. Wherefore David
saith, “My substance is with Thee:” (<scripRef passage="Psa. 39.6-7; 139.14" id="iv.xi-p26.1" parsed="|Ps|39|6|39|7;|Ps|139|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.39.6-Ps.39.7 Bible:Ps.139.14">Ps. xxxix. 7. <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xi-p26.2"> ὑπόστασις</span> Sept.
“hope” rec. vers. of. ver. 6; Ps. cxxxix. 14</scripRef>.) and Paul too, “For in Him
we live and move and have our being:” (<scripRef passage="Acts xvii. 28" id="iv.xi-p26.3" parsed="|Acts|17|28|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.17.28">Acts xvii. 28</scripRef>.) and plying the argument
about the faith, he says, (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. vi. 19, 20" id="iv.xi-p26.4" parsed="|1Cor|6|19|6|20" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.6.19-1Cor.6.20">1 Cor. vi. 19, 20</scripRef>.) “Ye are not your own,”
and “ye were bought with a price.” For all things are
God’s. When then He calls and chooses to take, let us not, like
grudging servants, fly from the reckoning, nor purloin our
Master’s goods. Thy soul is not thine; and how can thy wealth
be thine? How is it then that thou spendest on what is
unnecessary the things which are not thine? Knowest thou not that
for this we are soon to be put on our trial, that is, if we have
used them badly? But seeing that they are not our’s but our
Master’s, it were right to expend them upon our
fellow-servants. It is worth considering that the omission of
this was the charge brought against that rich man: and against
those also who had not given food to the Lord. (St. <scripRef passage="Luke 14.21; Matt. 25.42" id="iv.xi-p26.5" parsed="|Luke|14|21|0|0;|Matt|25|42|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.14.21 Bible:Matt.25.42">Luke xiv. 21. St. Matt. xxv. 42</scripRef>.)</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xi-p27">[7.] Say not then, “I am but spending mine own,
and of mine own I live delicately.” It is not of thine own, but
of other men’s. Other men’s, I say, because such is thine own
choice: for God’s will is that those things should be thine,
which have been entrusted unto thee on behalf of thy brethren.
Now the things which are not thine own become thine, if thou spend
them upon others: but if thou spend on thyself unsparingly, thine
own things become no longer thine. For since thou usest them
cruelly, and sayest, “That my own things should be altogether
spent on my own enjoyment is fair:” therefore I call them not
thine own. For they are common to thee and thy fellow-servants;
just as the sun is common, the air, the earth, and all the rest.
For as in the case of the body, each ministration belongs both to
the whole body and to each several member; but when it is applied
to one single member only, it destroys the proper function of that
very member: so also it comes to pass in the case of wealth.
And that what I say may be made plainer; the food of the body which
is given in common to the members, should it pass into one member,
even to that it turns out alien in the end. For when it cannot be
digested nor afford nourishment, even to that part, I say, it turns
out alien. But if it be made common, both that part and all the
rest have it as their own.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xi-p28">So also in regard of wealth. If you enjoy it
alone, you too have lost it: for you will not reap its reward.
But if you possess it jointly with the rest, then will it be more
your own, and then will you reap the benefit of it. Seest thou
not that the hands minister, and the mouth softens, and the stomach
receives? Doth the stomach say, Since I have received, I ought to
keep it all? Then do not thou I pray, in regard to riches, use
this language. For it belongs to the receiver to impart. As
then it is a vice in the stomach to retain the food and not to
distribute it, (for it is injurious to the whole body,) so it is a
vice in those that are rich to keep to themselves what they have.
For this destroys both themselves and others. Again, the eye
receives all the light: but it doth not itself alone retain it,
but enlightens the entire body. For it is not its nature to keep
it to itself, so long as it is an eye. Again, the nostrils are
sensible of perfume; but they do not keep it all to themselves, but
transmit it to the brain, and affect the stomach with a sweet
savor, and by their means refresh the entire man. The feet alone
walk; but they move not away themselves only, but transfer also the
whole body. In like manner do thou, whatsoever thou hast been
entrusted withal, keep it not to thyself alone, since thou art
doing harm to the whole and to thyself more than all.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xi-p29">And not in the case of the limbs only may one see
this occuring: for the smith also, if he chose to impart of his
craft to no one, ruins both himself and all other crafts.
Likewise the cordwainer, the husbandman, the baker, and everyone of
those who pursue any necessary calling; if he chose not to
communicate to anyone of the results of his art, will ruin not the
others only but himself also with them.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xi-p30">And why do I say, “the rich?” For the poor
too, if they followed after the wickedness of you who are covetous
and rich, would injure you very greatly and soon make you poor; yea
rather, they would quite destroy you, were they in your want
unwilling to impart of their own: the tiller of the ground, (for
instance,) of the labor of his hands; the sailor, of the gain from
his voyages; the soldier, of his distinction won in the wars.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xi-p31">Wherefore if nothing else can, yet let this at least
put you to shame, and do you imitate their benevolence. Dost thou
impart none of thy wealth unto any? Then shouldest thou not
receive any thing from another: in which case, the world will be
turned upside down. For in every thing to give and receive is the
principle of numerous blessings: in seeds, in scholars, in
arts. For if any one desire to keep his art to himself, he
subverts both himself and the whole course of things. And the
husbandman, if he bury and keep the seeds in his house, will bring
about a grievous famine. So also the rich man, if he act thus in
regard of his wealth, will 
<pb n="58" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_58.html" id="iv.xi-Page_58" />destroy himself before the poor, heaping up the
fire of hell more grievous upon his own head.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xi-p32">[8.] Therefore as teachers, however many scholars
they have, impart some of their lore unto each; so let thy
possession be, many to whom thou hast done good. And let all say,
“such an one he freed from poverty, such an one from dangers.
Such an one would have perished, had he not, next to the grace of
God, enjoyed thy patronage. This man’s disease thou didst cure,
another thou didst rid of false accusation, another being a
stranger you took in, another being naked you clothed.” Wealth
inexhaustible and many treasures are not so good as such sayings.
They draw all men’s gaze more powerfully than your golden
vestments, and horses, and slaves. For these make a man appear
even odious: (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xi-p32.1">φορτικόν</span>, a
conj. of Saville’s for <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xi-p32.2"> φορτικά</span>) they cause him to be hated as a common foe; but
the former proclaim him as a common father and benefactor. And,
what is greatest of all, Favor from God waits on thee in every part
of thy proceedings. What I mean is, let one man say, He helped to
portion out my daughter: another, And he afforded my son the
means of taking his station among men: (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xi-p32.3">εἰς ἄνδρας ἐμφανῆναι</span>) another, He made my calamity to
cease: another, He delivered me from dangers. Better than
golden crowns are words such as these, that a man should have in
his city innumerable persons to proclaim his beneficence. Voices
such as these are pleasanter far, and sweeter than the voices of
the heralds marching before the archons; to be called saviour,
benefactor, defender, (the very names of God;) and not, covetous,
proud, insatiate, and mean. Let us not, I beseech you, let us not
have a fancy for any of these titles, but the contrary. For if
these, spoken on earth, make one so splendid and illustrious; when
they are written in heaven, and God proclaims them on the day that
shall come, think what renown, what splendor thou shalt enjoy! 
Which may it be the lot of us all to obtain, through the grace and
loving-kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ; with Whom unto the Father
and the Holy Spirit, be glory, power, honor, now and always and
unto everlasting ages. Amen.</p>

<p class="c24" id="iv.xii-p4"><span class="c18" id="iv.xii-p4.1">Together</span> with all other
ills, I know not how, there hath come upon man’s nature the
disease of restless prying and of unseasonable curiosity, which
Christ Himself chastised, saying, (St. 
<scripRef passage="Matt. vii. 1" id="iv.xii-p4.2" parsed="|Matt|7|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.7.1">Matt. vii. 1</scripRef>.) “Judge not, that ye be not
judged.” A kind of thing, which hath no pleasure as all other
sins have, but only punishment and vengeance. For though we are
ourselves full of ten thousand evils, and bearing the “beams”
in our own eyes, we become exact inquisitors of the offences of our
neighbor which are not at all bigger than “motes.” And so
this matter at Corinth was falling out. Religious men and dear to
God were ridiculed and cast out for their want of learning; while
others, brimful of evils innumerable, were classed highly because
of their fluent speech. Then like persons sitting in public to
try causes, these were the sort of votes they kept rashly
passing: “such an one is worthy: such an one is better than
such another; this man is inferior to that; that, better than
this.” And, leaving off to mourn for their own bad ways, they
were become judges of others; and in this way again were kindling
grievous warfare.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xii-p5">Mark then, how wisely Paul corrects them, doing away
with this disease. For since he had said, “Moreover, it is
required in stewards that a man be found faithful,” and it seemed
as if he were giving them an opening to judge and pry into each
man’s life, and this was aggravating the party feeling; lest such
should be the effect on them, he draws them away from that kind of
petty disputation, saying, “With me it is a very small thing that
I should be judged of you;” again in his own person carrying on
the discourse.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xii-p6">[2.] But what means, “With me it is a very small
thing that I should be judged of you or of man’s day?” (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xii-p6.1">ἡμέρας</span>)  “I judge myself unworthy,” saith
he, “of being judged by you.” And why say I, “by you?”
I will add, “by (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xii-p6.2">καὶ τὸ</span> [<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xii-p6.3">τοῦ</span>]) any one else.” Howbeit, let no one
condemn Paul of arrogance; though he saith that no man is worthy to
pass sentence con<pb n="59" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_59.html" id="iv.xii-Page_59" />cerning him.
For first, he saith these things not for his own sake, but wishing
to rescue others from the odium which they had incurred from the
Corinthians. And in the next place, he limits not the matter to
the Corinthians merely, but himself also he deposes from this right
of judging; saying, that to decree such things was a matter beyond
his decision. At least he adds, “I judge not mine own
self.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xii-p7">But besides what has been said, we must search out
the ground upon which these expressions were uttered. For he knew
well in many cases how to speak with high spirit: and that, not
of pride or arrogance, but of a certain excellent management [<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xii-p7.1">οἰκονομίας  ἀρίστης</span>] seeing that in
the present case also he saith this, not as lifting up himself, but
as taking down other men’s sails, and earnestly seeking to invest
the saints with due honor. For in proof that he was one of the
very humble, hear what he saith, bringing forward the testimony of
his enemies on this point; “His bodily presence is weak, and his
speech of no account; (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. x. 10" id="iv.xii-p7.2" parsed="|2Cor|10|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.10.10">2
Cor. x. 10</scripRef>.) and again,
“Last of all, as to one born out of due time, He appeared unto me
also.” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. xv. 8" id="iv.xii-p7.3" parsed="|2Cor|15|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.15.8">2 Cor. xv.
8</scripRef>.) But
notwithstanding, see this lowly man, when the time called on him,
to what a pitch he raises the spirit of the disciples, not teaching
pride but instilling a wholesome courage. For with these same
discoursing he saith, “And if the world shall be judged by you,
are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters? 
<scripRef passage="1 Cor. vi. 2" id="iv.xii-p7.4" parsed="|1Cor|6|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.6.2">1 Cor. vi. 2</scripRef>. For as the Christian ought
to be far removed from arrogance, so also from flattery and a mean
spirit. Thus, if any one says, “I count money as nothing, but
all things here are to me as a shadow, and a dream, and child’s
play;” we are not at all to charge him as arrogant; since in this
way we shall have to accuse Solomon himself of arrogance, for
speaking austerely (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xii-p7.5">φιλοσοφοῦντα</span>) on these things, saying “Vanity
of vanities (<scripRef passage="Eccles. i. 2" id="iv.xii-p7.6" parsed="|Eccl|1|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Eccl.1.2">Eccles. i.
2</scripRef>.) all is vanity.”
But God forbid that we should call the strict rule of life by the
name of arrogance. Wherefore to despise these things is not
haughtiness, but greatness of soul; albeit we see kings, and
rulers, and potentates, making much of them. But many a poor man,
leading a strict life despises them; and we are not therefore to
call him arrogant but highminded: just as, on the other hand, if
any be extremely addicted to them, we do not call him lowly of
heart and moderate, but weak, and poor spirited, and ignoble. For
so, should a son despise the pursuits which become his father and
affect slavish ways, we should not commend him as lowly of heart,
but as base and servile we should reproach him. What we should
admire in him would be, his despising those meaner things and
making much account of what came to him from his father. For this
is arrogance, to think one’s self better than one’s
fellow-servants: but to pass the true sentence on things cometh
not of boasting, but of strictness of life.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xii-p8">On this account Paul also, not to exalt himself, but
to humble others, and to keep down those who were rising up out of
their places, and to persuade them to be modest, said, “With me
it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you or of
man’s day.” Observe how he soothes the other party also.
For whosoever is told that he looks down on all alike, and deigns
not to be judged of any one, will not thenceforth any more feel
pain, as though himself were the only one excluded. For if he had
said, “Of you,” only, and so held his peace; this were enough
to gall them as if treated contemptuously. But now, by
introducing, “nor yet of man’s day,” he brought alleviation
to the blow; giving them partners in the contempt. Nay, he even
softens this point again, saying, “not even do I judge
myself.” Mark the expression, how entirely free from
arrogance: in that not even he himself, he saith, is capable of
so great exactness.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xii-p9">[3.] Then because this saying also seemed to be
that of one extolling himself greatly, this too he corrects,
saying, “Yet am I not hereby justified.” What then? Ought
we not to judge ourselves and our own misdeeds? Yes surely: 
there is great need to do this when we sin. But Paul said not
this, “For I know nothing,” saith he, “against myself.”
What misdeed then was he to judge, when he “knew nothing against
himself?” Yet, saith he, “he was not justified.” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. vi. 3" id="iv.xii-p9.1" parsed="|1Cor|6|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.6.3">1 Cor. vi. 3</scripRef>.) We then who have our
conscience filled with ten thousand wounds, and are conscious to
ourselves of nothing good, but quite the contrary; what can we
say?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xii-p10">And how could it be, if he knew nothing against
himself that he was not justified? Because it was possible for
him to have committed certain sins, not however, knowing that they
were sins. From this make thine estimate how great shall be the
strictness of the future judgment. It is not, you see, as
considering himself unblameable that he saith it is so unmeet for
him to be judged by them, but to stop the mouths of those who were
doing so unreasonably. At least in another place, even though
men’s sins be notorious, he permits not judgment unto others,
because the occasion required it. “For why dost thou judge thy
brother,” saith he, (<scripRef passage="Rom. xiv. 10" id="iv.xii-p10.1" parsed="|Rom|14|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.14.10">Rom. xiv. 10</scripRef>.) or, “thou, why dost thou
set at nought thy brother?” For thou wert not enjoined, O man,
to judge others, but to test thine own doings. Why then dost thou
seize upon the office of the Lord? Judgment is His, not
thine.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xii-p11">To which effect, he adds, “Therefore judge <pb n="60" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_60.html" id="iv.xii-Page_60" />nothing before the time, until the
Lord come; who will both bring to light the hidden things of
darkness, and make manifest the counsels of the hearts, and then
shall each man have his praise from God.” What then? Is it
not right that our teachers should do this? It is right in the
case of open and confessed sins, and that with fitting opportunity,
and even then with pain and inward vexation: not as these were
acting at that time, of vain-glory and arrogance. For neither in
this instance is he speaking of those sins which all own to be
such, but about preferring one before another, and making
comparisons of modes of life. For these things He alone knows how
to judge with accuracy, who is to judge our secret doings, which of
these be worthy of greater and which of less punishment and
honor. But we do all this according to what meets our eye.
“For if in mine own errors,” saith he, “I know nothing
clearly, how can I be worthy to pass sentence on other men? And
how shall I who know not my own case with accuracy, be able to
judge the state of others?” Now if Paul felt this, much more
we. For (to proceed) he spake these things, not to exhibit
himself as faultless, but to shew that even should there be among
them some such person, free from transgression, not even he would
be worthy to judge the lives of others: and that if he, though
conscious to himself of nothing declare himself guilty, much more
they who have ten thousand sins to be conscious of in
themselves.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xii-p12">[4.] Having thus, you see, stopped the mouths of
those who pass such sentences, he travails next with strong feeling
ready to break out and come upon the unclean person. And like as
when a storm is coming on, some clouds fraught with darkness run
before it; afterwards, when the crash of the thunders ariseth and
works the whole heavens into one black cloud, then all at once the
rain bursts down upon the earth: so also did it then happen.
For though he might in deep indignation have dealt with the
fornicator, he doth not so; but with fearful words he first
represses the swelling pride of the man, since in truth, what had
occurred was a twofold sin, fornication, and, that which is worse
than fornication, the not grieving over the sin committed. For
not so much does he bewail the sin, as him that committed it and
did not as yet repent. Thus, “I shall bewail many of those,”
saith he, not simply “who have sinned heretofore,” but he adds,
“who have not repented of the uncleanness and impurity which they
wrought.” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. xii. 21" id="iv.xii-p12.1" parsed="|2Cor|12|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.12.21">2 Cor. xii.
21</scripRef>.) For he who after
sinning hath practised repentance, is a worthy object not of grief
but of gratulations, having passed over into the choir of the
righteous. For, (<scripRef passage="Is. xliii. 26" id="iv.xii-p12.2" parsed="|Isa|43|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.43.26">Is.
xliii. 26</scripRef>.) “declare
thou thine iniquities first, that thou mayest be justified:”
but if after sinning one is void of shame, he is not so much to be
pitied for falling as for lying where he is fallen.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xii-p13">Now if it be a grievous fault not to repent after
sins; to be puffed up because of sins, what sort of punishment doth
it deserve? For if he who is elate for his good deeds is unclean,
what pardon shall he meet with who has that feeling with regard to
his sins?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xii-p14">Since then the fornicator was of this sort, and had
rendered his mind so headstrong and unyielding through his sin, he
of course begins by casting down his pride. And he neither puts
the charge first, for fear of making him hardened, as singled out
for accusation before the rest; nor yet later, lest he should
suppose that what related to him was but incidental. But, having
first excited great alarm in him by his plain speaking towards
others, then, and not till then, he goes on to him, in the course
of his rebuke to others giving the man’s wilfulness a share
beforehand.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xii-p15">For these same words, viz. “I know nothing against
myself, yet am I not hereby justified,” and this, “He that
judgeth me is the Lord, who will both bring to light the hidden
things of darkness, and make manifest the counsels of the
hearts,” glance not lightly both upon that person, and upon such
as act in concert with him and despise the saints. “For
what,” saith he, “if any outwardly appear to be virtuous and
admirable persons? He, the Judge, is not a discerner of externals
only, but also brings to light all secrets.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xii-p16">[5.] On two accounts you see, or rather on three,
correct judgement belongs not to us. One, because, though we be
conscious to ourselves of nothing, still we need one to reprove our
sins with strictness. Another, because the most part of the
things which are done escape us and are concealed. And for a
third besides these, because many things which are done by others
seem to us indeed fair, but they come not of a right mind. Why
say ye then, that no sin hath been committed by this or that
person? That such an one is better than such another? Seeing
that this we are not to pronounce, not even concerning him who
knows nothing against himself. For He who discerns secrets, He it
is who with certainty judges.  Behold, for example; I for my part
know nothing against myself: yet neither so am I justified, that
is, I am not quit of accounts to be given, nor of charges to be
answered. For he doth not say this, “I rank not among the
righteous;” but “I am not pure from sin.” For elsewhere he
saith also, (<scripRef passage="Rom. vi. 7" id="iv.xii-p16.1" parsed="|Rom|6|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.6.7">Rom. vi.
7</scripRef>, <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xii-p16.2">δεδικαίωται, τουτεστιν  ἀπήλλακται</span>.) “He that
hath died is justified from sin,” that is, “is
liberated.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xii-p17">Again, many things we do, good indeed, but <pb n="61" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_61.html" id="iv.xii-Page_61" />not of a right mind. For so we
commend many, not from a wish to render them conspicuous, but to
wound others by means of them. And the thing done indeed is right
for the well-doer is praised; but the intention is corrupt: for
it is done of a satanical purpose. For this one hath often done,
not rejoicing with his brother, but desiring to wound the other
party.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xii-p18">Again, a man hath committed a great error; some
other person, wishing to supplant him, says that he hath done
nothing, and comforts him forsooth in his error by recurring to the
common frailty of nature. But oftentimes he doth this from no
mind to sympathize, but to make him more easy in his faults.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xii-p19">Again, a man rebukes oftentimes not so much to
reprove and admonish, as publicly to (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xii-p19.1">ἐκπομπεῦσαι
καὶ
ἐκτραγωδῆσαι</span>) display and exaggerate his
neighbor’s sin. Our counsels however themselves men do not
know; but, (<scripRef passage="Rom. viii. 27" id="iv.xii-p19.2" parsed="|Rom|8|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.8.27">Rom. viii.
27</scripRef>.) “He that searcheth
the hearts,” knows them perfectly; and He will bring all such
things into view at that time. Wherefore he saith, “Who will
bring to light the secret things of darkness and make manifest the
counsels of the hearts.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xii-p20">[6.] Seeing then that not even where we “know
nothing against ourselves,” can we be clean from accusations, and
where we do any thing good, but do it not of a right mind, we are
liable to punishment; consider how vastly men are deceived in their
judgments. For all these matters are not be come at by men, but
by the unsleeping Eye alone: and though we may deceive men, our
sophistry will never avail against Him. Say not then, darkness is
around me and walls; who seeth me? For He who by Himself formed
our hearts, Himself knoweth all things. (<scripRef passage="Ps. cxxxix. 12" id="iv.xii-p20.1" parsed="|Ps|139|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.139.12">Ps. cxxxix. 12</scripRef>.) “For darkness is no
darkness with Him.” And yet he who is committing sin, well
saith, “Darkness is around me and walls;” for were there not a
darkness in his mind he would not have cast out the fear of God and
acted as he pleased. For unless the ruling principle be first
darkened, the entrance of sin without fear is a thing impossible.
Say not then, who seeth me? For there is that (<scripRef passage="Heb. iv. 12" id="iv.xii-p20.2" parsed="|Heb|4|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Heb.4.12">Heb. iv. 12</scripRef>.) “pierceth even unto soul
and spirit, joints and marrow;” but thou seest not thyself nor
canst thou pierce the cloud; but as if thou hadst a wall on all
sides surrounding thee, thou art without power to look up unto the
heaven.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xii-p21">For whatsoever sin thou wilt, first let us examine,
and thou shalt see that so it is engendered. For as robbers and
they who dig through walls when they desire to carry off any
valuable thing, put out the candle and then do their work; so also
doth men’s perverse reasoning in the case of those who are
committing sin. Since in us also surely there is a light, the
light of reason, ever burning. But if the spirit of wickedness
coming eagerly on with its strong blast quench that flame, it
straightway darkens the soul and prevails against it, and despoils
it straightway of all that is laid up therein. For when by
unclean desire the soul is made captive, even as a cloud and mist
the eyes of the body, so that desire intercepts the foresight of
the mind, and suffers it to see nothing at any distance, either
precipice, or hell, or fear; but thenceforth, having that deceit as
a tyrant over him, he comes to be easily vanquished by sin; and
there is raised up before his eyes as it were a wall without
windows, which suffers not the ray of righteousness to shine in
upon the mind, the absurd conceits of lust enclosing it as with a
rampart on all sides. And from that time forward the unchaste
woman is everywhere meeting him: standing present before his
eyes, before his mind, before his thoughts. And as the blind,
although they stand at high noon beneath the very central point of
the heaven, receive not the light, their eyes being fast closed up;
just so these also, though ten thousand doctrines of salvation
sound in their ears from all quarters, having their soul
preoccupied with this passion stop their ears against such
discourses. And they know it well who have made the trial. But
God forbid that you should know it from actual experience.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xii-p22">[7.] And not only this sin hath these effects, but
every misplaced affection as well. For let us transfer, if you
please, the argument from the unchaste woman unto money, and we
shall see here also thick and unbroken darkness. For in the
former case, inasmuch as the beloved object is one and shut up in
one place, the feeling is not so violent; but in the case of money
which sheweth itself every where, in silversmiths’ shops, in
taverns, in foundries for gold, in the houses of the wealthy, the
passion blows a vehement gale. For when servants swaggering in
the market place, horses with golden trappings, men decked with
costly garments, are seen with desire by him who has that
distemper, the darkness becomes intense which envelopes him. And
why speak of houses and silversmiths’ shops? for my part I think
that such persons, though it be but in a picture and image that
they see the wealth, are convulsed, and grow wild, and rave. So
that from all quarters the darkness gathers around them. And if
they chance to behold a portraiture of a King, they admire not the
beauty of the precious stones, nor yet the gold, nor the purple
robe, but they pine away. And as the wretched lover before
mentioned, though he see but the image of the woman beloved,
cleaveth unto the lifeless thing; so this man also, beholding a
<pb n="62" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_62.html" id="iv.xii-Page_62" />lifeless image of wealth, is
more strongly affected in the same way, as being holden of a more
tyrannical passion. And he must henceforth either abide at home,
or if he venture into the Forum, return home with innumerable
hurts. For many are the objects which grieve his eyes. And just
as the former seeth nothing else save the woman, even so the latter
hastens by poor persons, and all things else, that he may not
obtain so much as a slight alleviation. But upon the wealthy he
steadily fixeth his eyes; by the sight of them introducing the fire
into his own soul mightily and vehemently. For it is a fire that
miserably devours the person that falls into it; and if no hell
were threatened nor yet punishment, this condition were itself
punishment; to be continually tormented and never able to find an
end to the malady.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xii-p23">[8.] Well: these things alone might suffice to
recommend our fleeing from this distemper. But there is no
greater evil than inconsideration which causes men to be rivetted
unto things that bring sorrow of heart and no advantage.
Wherefore I exhort that you cut off the passion at its beginning: 
for just as a fever on its first attack, does not violently burn up
the patients with thirst, but on its increase and the heightening
of its fire causes from that time incurable thirst; and though one
should let them fill themselves full of drink, it puts not out the
furnace but makes it burn fiercer: so also it happens in regard
to this passion; unless when it first invadeth our soul we stop it
and shut the doors; having got in, from that time it makes the
disease of those who have admitted it incurable. For so both good
things and bad, the longer they abide in us, the more powerful they
become.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xii-p24">And in all other things too, any one may see that
this cometh to pass. For so a plant but lately set in the ground
is easily pulled up; but no more so when rooted for a long time; it
then requires great strength in the lever. And a building newly
put together is easily thrown down by those who push against it;
but once well fixed, it gives great trouble to those who attempt to
pull it down. And a wild beast that hath made his accustomed
haunt in certain places for a long time is with difficulty driven
away.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xii-p25">Those therefore who are not yet possessed by the
passion in question, I exhort not to be taken captive. For it is
more easy to guard against falling into it, than having fallen to
get away.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xii-p26">[9.]  But unto those who are seized by it and
broken down, if they will consent to put themselves into the hands
of the <span class="c18" id="iv.xii-p26.1">Word</span> of healing, I promise large
hope of salvation, by the Grace of God. For if they will consider
those who have suffered and fallen into that distemper and have
recovered, they will have good hopes respecting the removal of the
disease. Who then ever fell into this disease, and was easily rid
of it? That well-known Zacchæus. For who could be more fond of
money than a publican? But all at once he became a man of strict
life, (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xii-p26.2">Φιλόσοφος</span>) and
put out all that blaze. Matthew in like manner: for he too was
a publican, living in continual rapine. But he likewise all at
once stripped himself of the mischief, and quenched his thirst, and
followed after spiritual gain. Considering therefore these, and
the like to them, despair not even thou. For if thou wilt,
quickly thou shalt be able to recover. And if you please,
according to the rule of physicians, we will prescribe accurately
what thou shouldest do.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xii-p27">It is necessary then, before all other things, to be
right in this, that we never despond, nor despair of our
salvation. Next, we must look not only upon the examples of those
who have done well, but also upon the sufferings of those who have
persisted in sin. For as we have considered Zacchæus, and
Matthew, even so ought we also to take account of Judas, and
Gehazi, and Ahar, [perhaps Achan, 
<scripRef passage="Josh. vii" id="iv.xii-p27.1" parsed="|Josh|7|0|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Josh.7">Josh. vii</scripRef>.] and Ahab, and Ananias, and
Sapphira, in order that by the one, we may cast out all despair,
and by the other cut off all indolence; and that the soul become
not reckless of the remedies suggested. And let us teach them of
themselves to say what the Jews said on that day, approaching unto
Peter, (<scripRef passage="Acts 2.37; 16.30" id="iv.xii-p27.2" parsed="|Acts|2|37|0|0;|Acts|16|30|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.2.37 Bible:Acts.16.30">Acts ii. 37, cf. xvi. 30</scripRef>.) “What must we do to be
saved?” And let them hear what they must do.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xii-p28">[10.] What then must we do? We must know how
worthless the things in question are, and that wealth is a run-away
slave, and heartless, and encompasseth its possessors with ills
innumerable. And such words, like charms, let us sound in their
ears continually. And as physicians soothe their patients when
they ask for cold water, by saying that they will give it, making
excuses about the spring, and the vessel, and the fit time, and
many more such, (for should they refuse at once, they make them
wild with phrensy,) so let us also act towards the lovers of
money. When they say we desire to be rich, let us not say
immediately that wealth is an evil thing; but let us assent, and
say that we also desire it; but in due time; yea, true wealth; yea,
that which hath undying pleasure: yea, that which is gathered for
thyself, and not for others, and those often our enemies. And let
us produce the lessons of true wisdom, and say, we forbid not
riches, but ill-gotten riches. For it is lawful to be rich, but
without covetousness, without rapine and violence, and an ill
report from all men. With these arguments let us first smooth
them down, and not as yet discourse of hell. For the sick man
endures not yet such sayings. Wherefore 
<pb n="63" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_63.html" id="iv.xii-Page_63" />let us go to this world for all our arguments
upon these matters; and say, “Why is it thy choice to be rich
through covetousness? That the gold and the silver may be laid up
for others, but for thee, curses and accusations innumerable? 
That he whom you have defrauded may be stung by want of the very
necessaries of life, and bewail himself, and draw down upon thee
the censure of thousands; and may go at fall of evening about the
market place, encountering every one in the alleys, and in utter
perplexity, and not knowing what to trust to even for that one
night? For how is he to sleep after all, with pangs of the belly,
restless famine besetting him, and that often while it is freezing,
and the rain coming down on him? And while thou, having washed,
returnest home from the bath, in a glow with soft raiment, merry of
heart and rejoicing, and hastening unto a banquet prepared and
costly: he, driven every where about the market place by cold and
hunger, takes his round, stooping low and stretching out his hands;
nor hath he even spirit without trembling to make his suit for his
necessary food to one so full fed and so bent on taking his ease;
nay, often he has to retire with insult. When therefore thou hast
returned home, when thou liest down on thy couch, when the lights
round thine house shine bright, when the table is prepared and
plentiful, at that time call to rememberance that poor miserable
man wandering about, like the dogs in the alleys, in darkness and
in mire; except indeed when, as is often the case, he has to depart
thence, not unto house, nor wife, nor bed, but unto a pallet of
straw; even as we see the dogs baying all through the night. And
thou, if thou seest but a little drop falling from the roof,
throwest the whole house into confusion, calling thy slaves and
disturbing every thing: while he, laid in rags, and straw, and
dirt, has to bear all the cold.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xii-p29">What wild beast would not be softened by these
things? Who is there so savage and inhuman that these things
should not make him mild? and yet there are some who are arrived at
such a pitch of cruelty as even to say that they deserve what they
suffer. Yea, when they ought to pity, and weep, and help to
alleviate men’s calamities, they on the contrary visit them with
savage and inhuman censures. Of these I should be glad to ask,
Tell me, why do they deserve what they suffer? Is it because they
would be fed and not starve?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xii-p30">No, you will reply; but because they would be fed in
idleness. And thou, dost not thou wanton in idleness? What say
I? Art thou not oft-times toiling in an occupation more grievous
than any idleness, grasping, and oppressing, and coveting? Better
were it if thou too wert idle after this sort; for it is better to
be idle in this way, than to be covetous. But now thou even
tramplest on the calamities of others, not only idling, not only
pursuing an occupation worse than idleness, but also maligning
those who spend their days in misery.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xii-p31">And let us farther narrate to them the disasters of
others; the untimely bereavements, the dwellers in prison, those
who are torn to pieces before tribunals, those who are trembling
for life; the unlooked for widowhood of women; the sudden reverse
of the rich: and with this let us soften their minds. For by
our narrations concerning others, we shall induce them by all means
to fear these evils in their own case too. For when they hear
that the son of such an one who was a covetous and grasping man, or
(<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xii-p31.1">ἠ  τοῦ δεῖνος</span> instead of
<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xii-p31.2">ἦν</span>; <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xii-p31.3">τοῦ δεῖνος</span>) the wife of such an one who
did many tyrannical actions, after the death of her husband endured
afflictions without end; the injured persons setting upon the wife
and the children, and a general war being raised from all quarters
against his house; although a man be the most senseless of beings,
yet expecting himself also to suffer the same, and fearing for his
own lest they undergo the same fate, he will become more
moderate. Now we find life full of many such histories, and we
shall not be at a loss for correctives of this kind.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xii-p32">But when we speak these things, let us not speak
them as giving advice or counsel, lest our discourse become too
irksome: but as in the order of the narrative and by association
with something else, let us proceed in each case unto that kind of
conversation, and let us be constantly putting them upon stories of
the kind, permitting them to speak of no subject except these which
follow: How such an one’s splendid and famous mansion fell
down; How it is so entirely desolate that all things that were in
it have come into the hands of others; How many trials have taken
place daily about this same property, what a stir; How many of that
man’s relations (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xii-p32.1">οἴκεται</span>,
probably <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xii-p32.2">οἰκεῖοι</span>) have died
either beggars, or inhabitants of a prison.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xii-p33">All these things let us speak as in pity for the
deceased, and as depreciating things present; in order that by fear
and by pity we may soften the cruel mind. And when we see men
shrinking into themselves at these narrations, then and not till
then let us introduce to their notice also the doctrine of hell,
not as terrifying these, but in compassion for others. And let us
say, But why speak of things present? For far, indeed, will our
concern be from ending with these; a yet more grievous punishment
will await all such persons: even a river of fire, and a
poisonous worm, and darkness interminable, and undying tortures.
If with such addresses we succeed in 
<pb n="64" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_64.html" id="iv.xii-Page_64" />throwing a spell over them, we shall correct both
ourselves and them, and quickly get the better of our
infirmity.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xii-p34">And on that day we shall have God to praise us: as
also Paul saith, “And then shall each man have praise from
God.”  For that which cometh from men, is both fleeting, and
sometimes it proceeds from no good intentions. But that which
cometh from God both abideth continually, and shines out clearly.
For when He who knew all things before their creation, and who is
free from all passion, gives praise, then also the demonstration of
our virtue is even unquestionable.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xii-p35">Knowing these things therefore, let us act so as to
be praised of God, and to acquire the greatest blessings; which God
grant us all to obtain, through the grace and loving-kindness of
our Lord Jesus Christ, with Whom to the Father and the Holy Spirit
be glory, power, honor, now and always, and unto all the ages of
eternity. Amen.</p>

censured tending to counteract the censurers, no room might be left
for flying out in wrath at the charges. But when the time came
for a gentler process, then he strips it off, and removes the mask,
and shows the persons concealed by the appellation of Paul and
Apollos. And on this account he said, “These things, brethren,
I have transferred in a figure unto myself and Apollos.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiii-p6">And as in the case of the sick, when the child being
out of health kicks and turns away from the food offered by the
physicians, the attendants call the father or the tutor, and bid
them take the food from the physician’s hands and bring it, so
that out of fear towards them he may take it and be quiet: so
also Paul, intending to censure them about certain other persons,
of whom some, he thought, were injured, others honored above
measure, did not set down the persons themselves, but conducted the
argument in his own name and that of Apollos, in order that
reverencing these they might receive his mode of cure. But that
once received, he presently makes known in whose behalf he was so
expressing himself.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiii-p7">Now this was not hypocrisy, but condescension (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xiii-p7.1">συγκατάβασις</span>) and tact (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xiii-p7.2">οἰκονομία</span>). For if he had said
openly, “As for you, the men whom ye are judging are saints, and
worthy of all admiration;” they might have taken it ill and
(<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xiii-p7.3">κἂν  ἀπεπήδησαν</span>) started
back. But now in saying, “But to me it is a very small thing
that I should be judged of you:” and again, “Who is Paul, and
who is Apollos?” he rendered his speech easy of reception.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiii-p8">This, if you mark it, is the reason why he says
here, “These things have I transferred in a figure unto myself
for your sakes, that in us ye may learn not to be wise above what
is written,” signifying that if he had applied his argument in
their persons, they would not have learnt all that they needed to
learn, nor would have admitted the correction, being vexed at what
was said. But as it was, revering Paul, they bore the rebuke
well.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiii-p9">[2.] But what is the meaning of, “not to be wise
above what is written?” It is written, (St. 
<scripRef passage="Matt. vii. 3" id="iv.xiii-p9.1" parsed="|Matt|7|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.7.3">Matt. vii. 3</scripRef>.) “Why beholdest thou the
mote that is in thy brothers’s eye, but considerest not the beam
that is in thine own eye?” and “Judge not, that ye be not
judged.” For if we are one and are mutually bound together, it
behooveth us not to rise up against one another. For “he that
humbleth himself shall be exalted,” saith he. And (St. <scripRef passage="Matt. 20.26,27; Mark 10.43" id="iv.xiii-p9.2" parsed="|Matt|20|26|20|27;|Mark|10|43|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.20.26-Matt.20.27 Bible:Mark.10.43">Matt. xx. 26, 27; St. Mark x. 43</scripRef>; not <i>verbatim</i>.)
“He that will be first of all, let him be the servant of
all.” These are the things which “are written.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiii-p10">“That no one of you be puffed up for one against
another.” Again, having dismissed the teachers, he rebukes the
disciples. For it was they who caused the former to be
elated.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiii-p11">And besides, the leaders would not quietly receive
that kind of speech because of their desire of outward glory: for
they were even blinded with that passion. Whereas the disciples,
as not reaping themselves the fruits of the 
<pb n="65" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_65.html" id="iv.xiii-Page_65" />glory, but procuring it for others, would both
endure the chiding with more temper, and had it more in their power
than the leading men to destroy the disease.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiii-p12">It seems then, that this also is a symptom of being
“puffed up,” to be elated on another’s account, even though a
man have no such feeling in regard of what is his own. For as he
who is proud of another’s wealth, is so out of arrogance; so also
in the case of another’s glory.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiii-p13">And he hath well called it “being puffed up.”
For when one particular member rises up over the rest, it is
nothing else but inflammation and disease; since in no other way
doth one member become higher than another, except when a swelling
takes place. (So in English “proud flesh.”)  And so in the
body of the Church also; whoever is inflamed and puffed up, he must
be the diseased one; for he is swollen above the proportion of the
rest. For this [disproportion] is what we mean by
“swelling.” And so comes it to pass in the body, when some
spurious and evil humor gathers, instead of the wonted
nourishment. So also arrogance is born; notions to which we have
no right coming over us. And mark with what literal propriety he
saith, be not “puffed up:” for that which is puffed up hath a
certain tumor of spirit, from being filled with corrupt humor.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiii-p14">These things, however, he saith, not to preclude all
soothing, but such soothing as leads to harm. “Wouldest thou
wait upon this or that person? I forbid thee not: but do it not
to the injury of another.” For not that we might array
ourselves one against another were teachers given us, but that we
might all be mutually united. For so the general to this end is
set over the host, that of those who are separate he may make one
body. But if he is to break up the army, he stands in the place
of an enemy rather than of a general.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiii-p15">[3.] <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 4.7" id="iv.xiii-p15.1" parsed="|1Cor|4|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.4.7">Ver. 7</scripRef>. “For who maketh thee to
differ? For what hast thou which thou didst not receive?”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiii-p16">From this point, dismissing the governed, he turns
to the governors.  What he saith comes to this: From whence is
evident that thou art worthy of being praised? Why, hath any
judgment taken place? any inquiry proceeded? any essay? any severe
testing? Nay, thou canst not say it: and if men give their
votes, their judgment is not upright. But let us suppose that
thou really art worthy of praise and hast indeed the gracious gift,
and that the judgment of men is not corrupt: yet not even in this
case were it right to be high-minded; for thou hast nothing of
thyself but from God didst receive it. Why then dost thou pretend
to have that which thou hast not? Thou wilt say, “thou hast
it:” and others have it with thee: well then, thou hast it
upon receiving it: not merely this thing or that, but all things
whatsoever thou hast.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiii-p17">For not to thee belong these excellencies, but to
the grace of God. Whether you name faith, it came of His calling;
or whether it be the forgiveness of sins which you speak of, or
spiritual gifts, or the word of teaching, or the miracles; thou
didst receive all from thence. Now what hast thou, tell me, which
thou hast not received, but hast rather achieved of thine own
self? Thou hast nothing to say. Well: thou hast received; and
does that make thee high-minded? Nay, it ought to make thee
shrink back into thyself. For it is not thine, what hath been
given, but the giver’s. What if thou didst receive it? thou
receivedst it of him. And if thou receivedst of him, it was not
thine which thou receivedst: and if thou didst but receive what
was not thine own, why art thou exalted as if thou hadst something
of thine own? Wherefore he added also, “Now if thou didst
receive it, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received
it?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiii-p18">[4.] Thus having, you see, made good his
argument by concession,<note place="end" n="59" id="iv.xiii-p18.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xiii-p19">
[That is, conceding that they had the gifts which they claimed.
C.]</p></note>
(<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xiii-p19.1">κατὰ συνδρομὴν</span>.) he indicates that they have their
deficiencies; and those not a few: and saith, “In the first
place, though ye had received all things, it were not meet to
glory, for nothing is your own; but as the case really stands there
are many things of which ye are destitute.” And in the
beginning he did but hint at this, saying, “I could not speak
unto you as unto spiritual:” and, “I determined to know
nothing among you, save Jesus Christ and Him crucified.” But
here he doth it in a way to abash them, saying,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiii-p20"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 4.8" id="iv.xiii-p20.1" parsed="|1Cor|4|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.4.8">Ver. 8</scripRef>.
“Already ye are filled, already ye are rich:” that is, ye
want nothing henceforth; ye are become perfect; ye have attained
the very summit; ye stand, as ye think, in need of no one, either
among Apostles or teachers.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiii-p21">“Already ye are filled.” And well saith he
“already;” pointing out, from the time, the incredibility of
their statements and their unreasonable notion of themselves. It
was therefore in mockery that he said to them, “So quickly have
ye come to the end;” which thing was impossible in the time: 
for all the more perfect things wait long in futurity: but to be
“full” with a little betokens a feeble soul; and from a little
to imagine one’s self “rich,” a sick and miserable one. For
piety is an insatiable thing; and it argues a childish mind to
imagine from just the beginnings that you have obtained the
whole: and for men who are not yet even in the prelude of a
matter, to be high-minded as if they had laid hold of the end.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiii-p22">Then also by means of what followeth he puts <pb n="66" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_66.html" id="iv.xiii-Page_66" />them yet more out of countenance; for
having said, “Already ye are full,” he added, “ye are become
rich, ye have reigned without us: yea and I would to God ye did
reign, that we also might reign with you.” Full of great
austerity is the speech: which is why it comes last, being
introduced by him after that abundance of reproof. For then is
our admonition respected and easily received, when after our
accusations we introduce our humiliating expressions, (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xiii-p22.1">τὰ ἐυτρεπτικὰ  ῤήματα</span>.) For this
were enough to repress even the shameless soul and strike it more
sharply than direct accusation, and correct the bitterness and
hardened feeling likely to arise from the charge brought. It
being certain that this more than anything else is the admirable
quality of those arguments which appeal to our sense of shame, that
they possess two contrary advantages. On the one hand, one cuts
deeper than by open invective: on the other hand, it causes the
person reprimanded to bear that severer stab with more entire
patience.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiii-p23">[5.] “Ye have reigned without us.” Herein
there is great force, as concerns both the teachers and the
disciples: and their ignorance, too, of themselves (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xiii-p23.1">τὸ  ἀσυνείδητον</span>.) is
pointed out, and their great inconsideration. For what he saith
is this: “In labors indeed,” saith he, “all things are
common both to us and to you, but in the rewards and the crowns ye
are first. Not that I say this in vexation:” wherefore he
added also, “I would indeed that ye did reign:” then, lest
there should seem to be some irony, he added, “that we also might
reign with you;” for, saith he, we also should be in possession
(<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xiii-p23.2">ἐπιτύχοιμεν</span>, <span class="c18" id="iv.xiii-p23.3">ms.</span>
Reg., <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xiii-p23.4">ἐπιτύχωμεν</span> Edd.) of these blessings. Dost thou
see how he shews in himself all at once his severity and his care
over them and his self-denying mind? Dost thou see how he takes
down their pride?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiii-p24"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 4.9" id="iv.xiii-p24.1" parsed="|1Cor|4|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.4.9">Ver. 9</scripRef>.
“For I think that God hath set forth us the Apostles last of all,
as men doomed to death.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiii-p25">There is great depth of meaning and severity implied
again in his saying, “us:” and not even with this was he
satisfied, but added also his dignity, hitting them vehemently: 
“us the Apostles;” who are enduring such innumerable ills; who
are sowing the word of Godliness; who are leading you unto this
severe rule of life. These “He hath set forth last, as doomed
to death,” that is, as condemned. For since he had said,
“That we also might reign with you,” and by that expression had
relaxed his vehemency in order not to dispirit them; he takes it up
again with greater gravity, and saith, “For I think that God hath
set forth us the Apostles last, as men doomed to death.” “For
according to what I see,” saith he, “and from what ye say, the
most abject of all men and emphatically the condemned, are we who
are put forward for continual suffering. But ye have already a
kingdom and honors and great rewards in your fancy.” And
wishing to carry out their reasoning to still greater absurdity,
and to exhibit it as incredible in the highest degree, he said not
merely, “We are ‘last,’” but, “God made us last;” nor
was he satisfied with saying, “last,” but he added also,
“doomed to death:” to the end that even one quite void of
understanding might feel the statement to be quite incredible, and
his words to be the words of one vexed and vehemently abashing
them.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiii-p26">Observe too the good sense of Paul. The topics by
which, when it is the proper time, he exalts and shews himself
honorable and makes himself great; by these he now puts them to
shame, calling himself “condemned.” Of so great consequence
is it to do all things at the befitting season. By “doomed to
death,” in this place he means “condemned,” and deserving of
ten thousand deaths.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiii-p27">[6.] “For we are made a spectacle unto the
world, and to angels, and to men.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiii-p28">What means, “We are become a spectacle unto the
world?” “Not in a single corner nor yet in a small part of
the world suffer we these things,” saith he; “but every where
and before all.” But what means, “unto angels?” It is
possible to “become a spectacle unto men,” but not so unto
angels, when the things done are ordinary. But our wrestlings are
such as to be worthy even of angelic contemplation. Behold from
the things by which he vilifies himself, how again he shows himself
great; and from the things about which they are proud, how he
displays their meanness. For since to be fools was accounted a
meaner thing than to appear wise; to be weak, than to be made
strong; and unhonored, than glorious and distinguished; and that he
is about to cast on them the one set of epithets, while he himself
accepted the other; he signifies that the latter are better than
the former; if at least because of them he turned the throng I say
not of men only, but also of the very angels unto the contemplation
of themselves. For not with men only is our wrestling but also
with incorporeal powers. Therefore also a mighty theatre is set
(<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xiii-p28.1">μέγα θέατρον κάθηται</span>.)</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiii-p29"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 4.10" id="iv.xiii-p29.1" parsed="|1Cor|4|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.4.10">Ver. 10</scripRef>. “We are fools for
Christ’s sake, but ye are wise in Christ.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiii-p30">Again, this also he spake in a way to abash them;
implying that it is impossible for these contraries to agree,
neither can things so distant from one another concur. “For how
can it be,” saith he, “that you should be wise, but we fools in
the things relating to Christ?” That is: the one sort beaten
and despised and <pb n="67" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_67.html" id="iv.xiii-Page_67" />dishonored and
esteemed as nothing; the others enjoying honor and looked up to by
many as a wise and prudent kind of people; it gives him occasion to
speak thus: as if he had said, “How can it be that they who
preach such things should be looked upon as practically engaged in
their contraries?”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiii-p31">“We are weak, but ye are strong.” That is, we
are driven about and persecuted; but ye enjoy security and are much
waited upon; howbeit the nature of the Gospel endureth it not.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiii-p32">“We are despised, but ye are honorable.” Here
he setteth himself against the noble and those who plumed
themselves upon external advantages.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiii-p33">“Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and
thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain
dwelling place; and we toil, working with our own hands.” That
is, “It is not an old story that I am telling but just what the
very time present bears me witness of: that of human things we
take no account nor yet of any outward pomp; but we look unto God
only.” Which thing we too have need to practice in every
place. For not only are angels looking on, but even more than
they He that presides over the spectacle.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiii-p34">[7.] Let us not then desire any others to applaud
us. For this is to insult Him; hastening by Him, as if
insufficient to admire us, we make the best of our way to our
fellow servants. For just as they who contend in a small theatre
seek a large one, as if this were insufficient for their display;
so also do they, who contending in the sight of God afterwards seek
the applause of men; giving up the greater praise and eager for the
less, they draw upon themselves severe punishment. What but this
hath turned every thing upside down? this puts the whole world into
confusion, that we do all things with an eye to men, and even for
our good things, we esteem it nothing to have God as an admirer,
but seek the approbation which cometh from our fellow-servants: 
and for the contrary things again, despising Him we fear men. And
yet surely they shall stand with us before that tribunal, doing us
no good. But God whom we despise now shall Himself pass the
sentence upon us.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiii-p35">But yet, though we know these things, we still gape
after men, which is the first of sins. Thus were a man looking on
no one would choose to commit fornication; but even though he be
ten thousand times on fire with that plague, the tyranny of the
passion is conquered by his reverence for men. But in God’s
sight men not only commit adultery and fornication; but other
things also much more dreadful many have dared and still dare to
do. This then alone, is it not enough to bring down from above
ten thousand thunderbolts? Adulteries, did I say, and
fornications? Nay, things even far less than these we fear to do
before men: but in God’s sight we fear no longer. From hence,
in fact, all the world’s evils have originated; because in things
really bad we reverence not God but men.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiii-p36">On this account, you see, both things which are
truly good, not accounted such by the generality, become objects of
our aversion, we not investigating the nature of the things, but
having respect unto the opinion of the many: and again, in the
case of evil things, acting on this same principle. Certain
things therefore not really good, but seeming fair unto the many,
we pursue, as goods, through the same habit. So that on either
side we go to destruction.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiii-p37">[8.] Perhaps many may find this remark somewhat
obscure. Wherefore we must express it more clearly. When we
commit uncleanness, (for we must begin from the instances alleged,)
we fear men more than God. When therefore we have thus subjected
ourselves unto them and made them lords over us; there are many
other things also which seem unto these our lords to be evil, not
being such; these also we flee for our part in like manner. For
instance; To live in poverty, many account disgraceful: and we
flee poverty, not because it is disgraceful nor because we are so
persuaded, but because our masters count it disgraceful; and we
fear them. Again, to be unhonored and contemptible, and void of
all authority seems likewise unto the most part a matter of great
shame and vileness. This again we flee; not condemning the thing
itself, but because of the sentence of our masters.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiii-p38">Again on the contrary side also we undergo the same
mischief. As wealth is counted a good thing, and pride, and pomp,
and to be conspicuous. Accordingly this again we pursue, not
either in this case from considering the nature of the things as
good, but persuaded by the opinion of our masters. For the people
is our master and the great mob (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xiii-p38.1">ὅ πολὺς
όχλος</span>); a savage master and a severe tyrant: not
so much as a command being needed in order to make us listen to
him; it is enough that we just know what he wills, and without a
command we submit: so great good will do we bear towards him.
Again, God threatening and admonishing day by day is not heard; but
the common people, full of disorder, made up of all manner of
dregs, has no occasion for one word of command; enough for it only
to signify with what it is well pleased, and in all things we obey
immediately.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiii-p39">[9.] “But how,” says some one, “is a man to
flee from these masters?” By getting a mind greater than
their’s; by looking into the nature of things; by condemning the
voice of the multitude; before all, by training himself in <pb n="68" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_68.html" id="iv.xiii-Page_68" />things really disgraceful to fear not
men, but the unsleeping Eye; and again, in all good things, to seek
the crowns which come from Him. For thus neither in other sort of
things shall we be able to tolerate them. For whoso when he doeth
right judges them unworthy to know his good deeds, and contents
himself with the suffrage of God; neither will he take account of
them in matters of the contrary sort.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiii-p40">“And how can this be?” you will say. Consider
what man is, what God; whom thou desertest, and unto whom thou
fliest for refuge; and thou wilt soon be right altogether. Man
lieth under the same sin as thyself, and the same condemnation, and
the same punishment. “Man is like to vanity,” (<scripRef passage="Ps. cxliv. 4" id="iv.xiii-p40.1" parsed="|Ps|144|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.144.4">Ps. cxliv. 4</scripRef>. LXX,) and hath not correct
judgment, and needs the correction from above. “Man is dust and
ashes,” and if he bestow praise, he will often bestow it at
random, or out of favor, or ill will. And if he calumniate and
accuse, this again will he do out of the same kind of purpose.
But God doeth not so: rather irreprovable in His sentence, and
pure His judgment. Wherefore we must always flee to Him for
refuge; and not for these reasons alone, but because He both made,
and more than all spares thee, and loves thee better than thou dost
thyself.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiii-p41">Why then, neglecting to have so admirable (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xiii-p41.1">θαυμαστόν</span>) an approver, betake we
ourselves unto man, who is nothing, all rashness, all at random? 
Doth he call thee wicked and polluted when thou art not so? So
much the more do thou pity him, and weep because he is corrupt; and
despise his opinion, because the eyes of his understanding are
darkened. For even the Apostles were thus evil reported of; and
they laughed to scorn their calumniators. But doth he call thee
good and kind? If such indeed thou art, yet be not at all puffed
up by the opinion: but if thou art not such, despise it the more,
and esteem the thing to be mockery.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiii-p42">Wouldest thou know the judgments of the greater part
of men, how corrupt they are, how useless, and worthy of ridicule;
some of them coming only from raving and distracted persons, others
from children at the breast? Hear what hath been from the
beginning. I will tell thee of judgments, not of the people only,
but also of those who passed for the wisest, of those who were
legislators from the earliest period. For who would be counted
wiser among the multitude than the person considered worthy of
legislating for cities and peoples? But yet to these wise men
fornication seems to be nothing evil nor worthy of punishment. At
least, no one of the heathen laws makes its penal or brings men to
trial on account of it. And should any one bring another into
court for things of that kind, the multitude laughs it to scorn,
and the judge will not suffer it. Dice-playing, again, is exempt
from all their punishments: nor did any one among them ever incur
penalty for it. Drunkenness and gluttony, so far from being a
crime, are considered by many even as a fine thing. And in
military carousals it is a point of great emulation; and they who
most of all need a sober mind and a strong body, these are most of
all given over to the tyranny of drunkenness; both utterly
weakening the body and darkening the soul. Yet of the lawgivers
not one hath punished this fault. What can be worse than this
madness?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiii-p43">Is then the good word of men so disposed an object
of desire to thee, and dost thou not hide thyself in the earth? 
For even though all such admired thee, oughtest thou not to feel
ashamed and cover thy face, at being applauded by men of such
corrupt judgment?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiii-p44">Again, blasphemy by legislators in general is
accounted nothing terrible. At any rate, no one for having
blasphemed God was ever brought to trial and punishment. But if a
man steal another’s garment, or cut his purse, his sides are
flayed, and he is often given over unto death: while he that
blasphemeth God hath nothing laid to his charge by the heathen
legislators. And if a man seduce a female servant when he hath a
wife, it seems nothing to the heathen laws nor to men in
general.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiii-p45">[10.] Wilt thou hear besides of some things of
another class which shew their folly? For as they punish not
these things, so there are others which they enforce by law. What
then are these? They collect crowds to fill theatres, and there
they introduce choirs of harlots and prostituted children, yea such
as trample on nature herself; and they make the whole people sit on
high, and so they captivate their city; so they crown these mighty
kings whom they are perpetually admiring for their trophies and
victories. And yet, what can be more insipid than this honor?
what more undelightful than this delight? From among these then
seekest thou judges to applaud thy deeds? And is it in company
with dancers, and effeminate, and buffoons, and harlots, that thou
art fain to enjoy the sound of compliment? answer me.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiii-p46">How can these things be other than proofs of
extreme infatuation? For I should like to ask them, is it or is
it not, a dreadful thing to subvert the laws of nature, and

bring them in, but honor them also with honors <pb n="69" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_69.html" id="iv.xiii-Page_69" />innumerable, and gifts not to be

Bingham (b. xvi. c. 4. §. 10.) proves that actors and the

calling, from very early times: from S. Cyprian, <scripRef passage="Ep. 61" id="iv.xiii-p49.1">Ep. 61</scripRef>, who
says, “I think it inconsistent with the majesty of God and the
discipline of the Gospel, to allow the chastity and glory of the
Church to be defiled with so base contagion:” from Tertullian;

persons? Since if they be infamous expulsion is properest for the
infamous. For why didst thou render them infamous? in praise or
in condemnation? Of course in condemnation. Is the next thing
to be, that although as after condemnation you make them infamous,
yet as if they were honorable you run to see them, and admire and

full of all senseless excitement train the populace to acquire a
merciless and savage and inhuman kind of temper, and practise them
in seeing men torn in pieces, and blood flowing, and the ferocity
of wild beasts confounding all things. Now all these our wise

which clearly and confessedly are abominable, but seemed (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xiii-p52.1">οὐκ ἐδοξεν</span>. perhaps “were not

their grave precepts; and thou shalt see these too corrupted
through the opinion of the multitude. Thus marriage is accounted

and by those without: and it is honorable. But when marriages
are solemnized, such ridiculous things<note place="end" n="64" id="iv.xiii-p52.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xiii-p53">
S. Chrys. on Gen. Hom. 48. near the end, speaking of Rebekah’s
veiling herself at sight of Isaac; “See the noble breeding of the
maiden.……and observe here, I pray you, how there is no place
here for these superfluous and useless things; for a diabolical
procession, for cymbals and flutes and dances, and those revels,
the device of Satan, and invectives full of all indecency; but all
wisdom, all gravity, all thoughtfulness.……Let Rebekah be the
pattern of our wives, let our husbands emulate Isaac; be it their
endeavor thus to bring home their brides.” Then complaining,
nearly as in the text, of the Fescennine verses, as they were
called, and other bad customs, relics of heathenism, “Rather,”
says he, “should the maiden be trained in all modesty from the
beginning, and priests called, and prayers and blessings be used to
rivet fast the concord of their common habitation, that so both the
bridegroom’s love may increase, and the damsel’s purity of soul
be heightened. So by all ways shall the deeds of virtue enter
into that house, and all the acts of the devil be far off and they
shall pass their life with joy, God’s Providence bringing them
together.” So again Hom. 56. of the marriage of Jacob and
Leah: in which place he complains especially of the introduction
of people from the stage and orchestra at wedding feasts. See
both places in Bingham, xxii. iv. 8: as also the 53d Canon of
Laodicea: “It is wrong for Christians attending marriages to
practice theatrical gestures or dances, but to take their part
soberly in the morning or evening meal, as becometh
Christians.”</p></note> take place as ye shall hear of
immediately: because the most part, possessed and beguiled by
custom, are not even aware of their absurdity, but need others to
teach them. For dancing, and cymbals, and flutes, and shameful
words, and songs, and drunkenness, and revellings, and all the
Devil’s great heap (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xiii-p53.1">πολὺς ὁ τοῦ  διαβόλου φορυτός</span>) of
garbage is then introduced.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiii-p54">I know indeed that I shall appear ridiculous in
finding fault with these things; and shall incur the charge of
great folly with the generality, as disturbing the ancient laws: 
for, as I said before, great is the deceptive power of custom.
But nevertheless, I will not cease repeating these things: for
there is, there is surely a chance, that although not all, yet some
few will receive our saying and will choose to be laughed to scorn
with us, rather than we laugh with them such a laughter as deserves
tears and overflowing punishment and vengeance.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiii-p55">For how can it be other than worthy of the utmost
condemnation that a damsel who hath spent her life entirely at home
and been schooled in modesty from earliest childhood, should be
compelled on a sudden to cast off all shame, and from the very
commencement of her marriage be instructed in imprudence; and find
herself put forward in the midst of wanton and rude men, and
unchaste, and effeminate? What evil will not be implanted in the
bride from that day forth? Immodesty, petulance, insolence, the
love of vain glory: since they will naturally go on and desire to
have all their days such as these. Hence our women become
expensive and profuse; hence are they void of modesty, hence
proceed their unnumbered evils.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiii-p56">And tell me not of the custom: for if it be an
evil thing, let it not be done even once: but if good, let it be
done constantly. For tell me, is not committing fornication
evil? Shall we then allow just once this to be done? By no
means. Why? Because though it be done only once, it is evil all
the same. So also that the bride be entertained in this way, if
it be evil, let it not be done even once; but if it be not evil,
let it even be done always.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiii-p57">“What then,” saith one, “dost thou find fault
with marriage? tell me.” That be far from me. I am not so
senseless: but the things which are so unworthily appended to
marriage, the painting the face, the coloring the eyebrows, and all
the other niceness of that kind. For indeed from that day she
will receive many lovers even before her destined consort.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiii-p58"><pb n="70" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_70.html" id="iv.xiii-Page_70" />“But many will
admire the woman for her beauty.” And what of that? Even if
discreet, she will hardly avoid evil suspicion; but if careless,
she will be quickly overtaken, having got that very day a starting
point in dissolute behavior.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiii-p59">Yet though the evils are so great, the omission of
these proceedings is called an insult, by certain who are no better
than brute beasts, and they are indignant that the woman is not
exhibited to a multitude, that she is not set forth as a stage
spectacle, common to all beholders: whereas most assuredly they
should rather count it insult when these things do take place; and
a laughing stock, and a farce. For even now I know that men will
condemn me of much folly and make me a laughing stock: but the
derision I can bear when any gain accrues from it. For I should
indeed be worthy of derision, if while I was exhorting to contempt
of the opinion of the many, I myself, of all men, were subdued by
that feeling.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiii-p60">Behold then what follows from all this. Not in the
day only but also in the evening, they provide on purpose men that
have well drunk, besotted, and inflamed with luxurious fare, to
look upon the beauty of the damsel’s countenance; nor yet in the
house only but even through the market-place do they lead her in
pomp to make an exhibition; conducting her with torches late in the
evening so as that she may be seen of all: by their doings
recommending nothing else than that henceforth she put off all
modesty. And they do not even stop here; but with shameful words
do they conduct her. And this with the multitude is a law. And
runaway slaves and convicts, thousands of them and of desperate
character, go on with impunity uttering whatever they please, both
against her and against him who is going to take her to his home.
Nor is there any thing solemn, but all base and full of
indecency. Will it not be a fine lesson in chastity for the bride
to see and hear such things? [Savile reads this sentence with a
question.] And there is a sort of diabolical rivalry among these
profligates to outdo one another in their zealous use of reproaches
and foul words, whereby they put the whole company out of
countenance, and those go away victorious who have found the
largest store of railings and the greatest indecencies to throw at
their neighbors.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiii-p61">Now I know that I am a troublesome, sort of person
and disagreeable, and morose, as though I were curtailing life of
some of its pleasure. Why, this is the very cause of my mourning
that things so displeasing are esteemed a sort of pleasure. For
how, I ask, can it be other than displeasing to be insulted and
reviled? to be reproached by all, together with your bride? If
any one in the market place speak ill of thy wife, thou makest ado
without end and countest life not worth living: and can it be
that disgracing thyself with thy future consort in the presence of
the whole city, thou art pleased and lookest gay on the matter? 
Why, what strange madness is this!</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiii-p62">“But,” saith one, “the thing is
customary.” Nay, for this very reason we ought most to bewail
it, because the devil hath hedged in the thing with custom. In
fact, since marriage is a solemn thing and that which recruits our
race and the cause of numerous blessings; that evil one, inwardly
pining and knowing that it was ordained as a barrier against
uncleanness, by a new device introduces into it all kinds of
uncleanness. At any rate, in such assemblages many virgins have
been even corrupted. And if not so in every case, it is because
for the time the devil is content with those words and those songs,
so flagitious; with making a show of the bride openly, and leading
the bridegroom in triumph through the market-place.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiii-p63">Moreover, because all this takes place in the
evening, that not even the darkness may be a veil to these evils,
many torches are brought in, suffering not the disgraceful scene to
be concealed. For what means the vast throng, and what the
wassail, and what the pipes? Most clearly to prevent even those
who are in their houses and plunged [<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xiii-p63.1">βαπτιζόμενοι</span>] in deep sleep from remaining
ignorant of these proceedings; that being wakened by the pipe and
leaning to look out of the lattices, they may be witnesses of the
comedy such as it is.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiii-p64">What can one say of the songs themselves,
crammed as they are with all uncleanness, introducing monstrous
amours, and unlawful connections, and subversions of houses, and
tragic scenes without end; and making continual mention of the
titles of “friend and lover,” “mistress and beloved?”
And, what is still more grievous, that young women are present at
these things, having divested themselves of all modesty; in honor
of the bride, rather I should say to insult her, exposing even
their own salvation<note place="end" n="65" id="iv.xiii-p64.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xiii-p65">
<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xiii-p65.1">τῆς ἑαυτῶν προτείνουσαι σωτηρίας</span>.
The Benedictine translates as if it were <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xiii-p65.2">τὰς
ἑαυτῶν</span>: which is here followed. [The true reading as
given by Field is <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xiii-p65.3">τὴν ἑαυτῶν προπίνουςαι
σωτηρίαν</span>. C.]</p></note>, and in the
midst of wanton young men acting a shameless part with their
disorderly songs, with their foul words, with their devilish
harmony. Tell me then: dost thou still enquire, “Whence come
adulteries? Whence fornications? Whence violations of
marriage?”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiii-p66">[12.] “But they are not noble nor decent
women,” you will say, “who do these things.” Why then laugh
me to scorn for this remonstrance, having been thyself aware of
this law, before I said any thing. I say, if the proceed<pb n="71" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_71.html" id="iv.xiii-Page_71" />ings are right, allow those well-born
women also to enact them. For what if these others live in
poverty? Are not they also virgins? ought not they also to be
careful of chastity? But now here is a virgin dancing in a public
theatre of licentious youths; and, I ask, seems she not unto thee
more dishonored than a harlot?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiii-p67">But if you say, “Female servants do these
things;” neither so do I acquit thee of my charge: for neither
to these ought such things to have been permitted. For hence all
these evils have their origin, that of our household we make no
account. But it is enough in the way of contempt to say, “He is
a slave,” and, “They are handmaids.” And yet, day after day
we hear, (<scripRef passage="Gal. iii. 28" id="iv.xiii-p67.1" parsed="|Gal|3|28|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gal.3.28">Gal. iii.
28</scripRef>.) “In Christ Jesus
there is neither bond nor free.” Again, were it a horse or an
ass, thou dost not overlook it but takest all pains not to have it
of an inferior kind; and thy slaves who have souls like thine own
dost thou neglect? And why do I say slaves, when I might say sons
and daughters? What then must follow? It cannot be but grief
(<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xiii-p67.2">λύπην</span>, qu. <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xiii-p67.3">λύμην</span>, “mischief.”) must immediately enter
in, when all these are going to ruin. And often also very great
losses must ensue, valuable golden ornaments being lost in the
crowd and the confusion.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiii-p68">[13.] Then after the marriage if perchance a child
is born, in this case again we shall see the same folly and many
practices [<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xiii-p68.1">σύμβολα</span>] full
of absurdity. For when the time is come for giving the infant a
name, caring not to call it after the saints as the ancients at
first did, they light lamps and give them names, and name the child
after that one which continues burning the longest; from thence
conjecturing that he will live a long time. After all, should
there be many instances of the child’s untimely death, (and there
are many,) great laughter on the devil’s part will ensue, at his
having made sport of them as if they were silly children. What
shall we say about the amulets and the bells which are hung upon
the hand, and the scarlet woof, and the other things full of such
extreme folly; when they ought to invest the child with nothing
else save the protection of the Cross<note place="end" n="66" id="iv.xiii-p68.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xiii-p69">
Compare St. Chrys. on Coloss. Hom. viii. near the end.</p></note>. But now that is despised which
hath converted the whole world and given the sore wound to the
devil and overthrown all his power: while the thread, and the
woof, and the other amulets of that kind are entrusted with the
child’s safety.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiii-p70">May I mention another thing yet more
ridiculous than this? Only let no one tax us with speaking out of
season, should our argument proceed with that instance also. For
he that would cleanse an ulcer will not hesitate first to pollute
his own hands. What then is this so very ridiculous custom? It
is counted indeed as nothing; (and this is why I grieve;) but it is
the beginning of folly and madness in the extreme. The women in
the bath, nurses and waiting-maids, take up mud and smearing it
with the finger make a mark on the child’s forehead; and if one
ask, What means the mud, and the clay? the answer is, “It turneth
away an evil eye, witchcraft and envy<note place="end" n="67" id="iv.xiii-p70.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xiii-p71">
So on Col. ubi supra. “What is all this folly? Here we have
ashes, and soot, and salt, and the silly old woman again brought
into play. Truly it is a mockery and a shame. ‘Nay,’ says
she, ‘an evil eye has caught hold of the child!’ How long
will you go on with these diabolical fancies?” &amp;c.</p></note>.” Astonishing! what power in the
mud! what might in the clay! what mighty force is this which it
has? It averts all the host of the devil. Tell me, can ye help
hiding yourselves for shame? Will ye never come to understand the
snares of the devil, how from earliest life he gradually brings in
the several evils which he hath devised? For if the mud hath this
effect, why dost thou not thyself also do the same to thine own
forehead, when thou art a man and thy character is formed; and thou
art likelier than the child to have such as envy thee? Why dost
thou not as well bemire the whole body? I say, if on the forehead
its virtue be so great, why not anoint thyself all over with mud? 
All this is mirth and stage-play to Satan, not mockery only but
hell-fire being the consummation to which these deceived ones are
tending.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiii-p72">[14.] Now that among Greeks such things should be
done is no wonder: but among the worshippers of the Cross, (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xiii-p72.1">τὸν  σταυρὸν προσκυνοῦσι</span>)
and partakers in unspeakable mysteries, and professors of such high
morality, (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xiii-p72.2">τοσαῦτα φιλοσοφοῦσιν</span>) that such unseemliness
should prevail, this is especially to be deplored again and
again. God hath honored thee with spiritual anointing; and dost
thou defile thy child with mud? God hath honored thee, and dost
thou dishonor thyself? And when thou shouldest inscribe on his
forehead the Cross which affords invincible security; dost thou
forego this, and cast thyself into the madness of Satan?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiii-p73">If any look on these things as trifles, let them
know that they are the source of great evils; and that not even
unto Paul did it seem right to overlook the lesser things. For,
tell me, what can be less than a man’s covering his head? Yet
observe how great a matter he makes of this and with how great
earnestness he forbids it; saying, among many things, “He
dishonoreth his head.” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. xi. 4" id="iv.xiii-p73.1" parsed="|1Cor|11|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.11.4">1 Cor. xi. 4</scripRef>.) Now if he that
covers himself “dishonoreth his head”; he that besmears his
child with mud, how can it be less than making it abominable? For
how, I want to know, can he bring it to the hands of the priest? 
How canst thou require that on that forehead the seal<note place="end" n="68" id="iv.xiii-p73.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xiii-p74">
i.e. the sign of the cross in baptism, made with consecrated balm
or ointment, and called <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xiii-p74.1">σφρᾶγις</span> in the
Apostolical Constitutions, iii. 17; vid. Bingham xi. 9. 6. St.
Chrysostom, it may be remarked, takes for granted, 1. that infants
would be brought to baptism; 2. that they would be brought to the
priest.</p></note> should be placed by the hand
<pb n="72" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_72.html" id="iv.xiii-Page_72" />of the presbyter, where thou
hast been smearing the mud? Nay, my brethren, do not these
things, but from earliest life encompass them with spiritual armor
and instruct them to seal the forehead with the hand (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xiii-p74.2">τῇ  χειρὶ παιδεύτε σφραγίζειν τὸ  μέτωπον</span>): and before they are able to do this with
their own hand<note place="end" n="69" id="iv.xiii-p74.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xiii-p75">
Compare the well-known passages in Tertullian and St.
Cyprian: the first, “At all our goings out and comings in,
&amp;c. we trace upon the forehead the sign of the cross;” <i>de
Cor. Mil</i>. 3.: the other, “Arm your foreheads with all
boldness, that the sign of the cross may be safe.” <scripRef passage="Ep. 50" id="iv.xiii-p75.1">Ep. 50</scripRef>:

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiii-p76">Why should one speak of the other satanical
observances in the case of travail-pangs and childbirths, which the
midwives introduce with a mischief on their own heads? Of the
outcries which take place at each person’s death, and when he is

whose good opinion thou followest after? And what can it be but
the extreme of folly to seek earnestly the praise of men, so

sentence in all that we do and speak? For these, even if they
approve, will have no power to profit us. But He, should He

<p class="c27" id="iv.xiv-p3">“We are fools for Christ’s sake:” (For it is
necessary from this point to resume our discourse:)  “but ye are
wise in Christ: we are weak, but ye are strong: ye have glory,
but we have dishonor.”</p>

<p class="c24" id="iv.xiv-p4"><span class="c18" id="iv.xiv-p4.1">Having</span> filled his speech
with much severity which conveys a sharper blow than any direct
charge and having said, “Ye have reigned without us;” and
“God hath set forth us last, as men doomed to death” he shows
by what comes next how they are “doomed to death;” saying, We
are fools, and weak, and despised, and hunger, and thirst, and are
naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwelling place, and
toil, working with our own hands:” which were very signs of
genuine teachers and apostles. Whereas the others prided
themselves on the things which are contrary to these, on wisdom,
glory, wealth, consideration.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiv-p5">Desiring therefore to take down their self-conceit
and to point out that in respect of these things, so far from
taking credit to themselves, they ought rather to be ashamed; he
first of all mocks them, saying, “Ye have reigned without
us.” As if he had said, “My sentence is that the present is
not a time of honor nor of glory, which kind of things you enjoy,
but of persecution and insult, such as we are suffering. If
however it be not so; if this rather be the time of remuneration: 
then as far as I see,” (but this he saith in irony,) “ye, the
disciples, for your part have become no less than kings: but we
the teachers and apostles, and before all entitled to receive the
reward, not only have fallen very far behind you, but even, as
persons doomed to death, that is, condemned convicts, spend our
lives entirely in dishonors, and dangers, and hunger: yea
insulted as fools, and driven about, and enduring all intolerable
things.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiv-p6">Now these things he said that he might hereby cause
them also to consider, that they should zealously seek the
condition of the Apostles; their dangers and their indignities, not
their honors and glories. For these, not the other, are what the
Gospel requires. But to this effect he speaks not directly, not
to shew himself disagreeable to them: rather in a way
characteristic of himself he takes in hand this rebuke. For if he
had introduced his address in a direct manner, he would have spoken
thus; “Ye err, and are beguiled, and have swerved far from the
apostolical mode of instruction. For every apostle and minister
of Christ ought to be esteemed a fool, ought to live in affliction
and <pb n="73" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_73.html" id="iv.xiv-Page_73" />dishonor; which indeed is
our state: whereas you are in the contrary case.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiv-p7">But thus might his expressions have offended them
yet more, as containing but praises of the Apostles; and might have
made them fiercer, censured as they were for indolence and
vainglory and luxuriousness. Wherefore he conducts not his
statement in this way, but in another, more striking but less
offensive; and this is why he proceeds with his address as follows,
saying ironically, “But ye are strong and honorable;” since, if
he had not used irony, he would have spoken to this effect; “It
is not possible that one man should be esteemed foolish, and
another wise; one strong, and another weak; the Gospel requiring
both the one and the other. For if it were in the nature of
things that one should be this, and another that, perchance there
might be some reason in what you say. But now it is not
permitted, either to be counted wise, or honorable, or to be free
from dangers. If otherwise, it follows of necessity that you are
preferred before us in the sight of God; you the disciples before
us the teachers, and that after our endless hardships.” If this
be too bad for anyone to say, it remains for you to make our
condition your object.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiv-p8">[2.] And “let no one,” saith he, “think that
I speak only of the past:”</p>

hour we both hunger and thirst and are naked.” Seest thou that
all the life of Christians must be such as this; and not merely a
day or two? For though the wrestler who is victorious in a single
contest only, be crowned, he is not crowned again if he suffer a
fall.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiv-p10">“And hunger;” against the luxurious. “And
are buffeted;” against those who are puffed up. “And have no
certain dwelling-place;” for we are driven about. “And are
naked;” against the rich.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiv-p11"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 4.12" id="iv.xiv-p11.1" parsed="|1Cor|4|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.4.12">Ver. 12</scripRef>. “And labor;” now
against the false apostles who endure neither toil nor peril, while
they themselves receive the fruits. “But not so are we,”
saith he: “but together with our perils from without, we also
strain ourselves to the utmost with perpetual labor. And what is
still more, no one can say that we fret at these things, for the
contrary is our requital to them that so deal with us: this, I
say, is the main point, not our suffering evil, for that is common
to all, but our suffering without despondency or vexation. But we
so far from desponding are full of exultation. And a sure proof
of this is our requiting with the contrary those who do us
wrong.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiv-p12">Now as to the fact that so they did, hear what
follows.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiv-p13">[<scripRef passage="1 Cor. 4.12,13" id="iv.xiv-p13.1" parsed="|1Cor|4|12|4|13" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.4.12-1Cor.4.13">Ver. 12, 13</scripRef>.] “Being reviled, we bless;
being persecuted, we endure; being defamed, we entreat; we are made
as the filth of the world.” This is the meaning of “fools for
Christ’s sake.” For whoso suffers wrong and avenges not
himself nor is vexed, is reckoned a fool by the heathen; and
dishonored and weak. And in order that he might not render his
speech too unpalatable by referring the sufferings he was speaking
of to their city, what saith he? “We are made the filth,”
not, “of your city,” but, “of the world.” And again,
“the off-scouring of all men;” not of you alone, but of all.
As then when he is discoursing of the providential care of Christ,
letting pass the earth, the heaven, the whole creation, the Cross
is what he brings forward; so also when he desires to attract them
to himself hurrying by all his miracles, he speaks of his
sufferings on their account. So also it is our method when we be
injured by any and despised, whatsoever we have endured for them,
to bring the same forward.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiv-p14">“The offscouring of all men, even until now.”
This is a vigorous blow which he gave at the end, “of all men;”
“not of the persecutors only,” saith he, “but of those also
for whom we suffer these things: Oh greatly am I obliged to
them.” It is the expression of one seriously concerned; not in
pain himself, but desiring to make them feel, (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xiv-p14.1">πλῆξαι</span>) that he who hath innumerable complaints
to make should even salute them. And therefore did Christ command
us to bear insults meekly that we might both exercise ourselves in
a high strain of virtue, and put the other party to the more
shame. For that effect one produces not so well by reproach as by
silence.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiv-p15"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 4.14" id="iv.xiv-p15.1" parsed="|1Cor|4|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.4.14">Ver. 14</scripRef>. [3.] Then since he saw
that the blow could not well be borne, he speedily heals it;
saying, “I write not these things to shame you, but to admonish
you as my beloved children.” “For not as abashing you,”
saith he, “do I speak these things.” The very thing which by
his words he had done, this he says he had not done: rather he
allows that he had done it, not however with an evil and spiteful
mind. Why, this mode of soothing is the very best, if we should
say what we have to say and add the apology from our motive. For
not to speak was impossible, since they would have remained
uncorrected: on the other hand, after he had spoken, to leave the
wound untended, were hard. Wherefore along with his severity he
apologizes: for this so far from destroying the effect of the
knife, rather makes it sink deeper in, while it moderates the full
pain of the wound. Since when a man is told that not in reproach
but in love are these things said, he the more readily receives
correction.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiv-p16">However, even here also is great severity, and a
strong appeal to their sense of shame, (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xiv-p16.1">ἐντροπή</span>)
<pb n="74" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_74.html" id="iv.xiv-Page_74" />in that he said not, “As a
master” nor yet “as an apostle,” nor yet “as having you for
my disciples;” (which had well suited his claims on them;) but,
“as my beloved children I admonish you.” And not simply,
children; but, “longed after.” “Forgive me,” saith he.
“If anything disagreeable has been said, it all proceeds of
love.” And he said not, “I rebuke,” but “I admonish.”
Now, who would not bear with a father in grief, and in the act of
giving good advice? Wherefore he did not say this before, but
after he had given the blow.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiv-p17">“What then?” some might say; “Do not other
teachers spare us?” “I say not so, but, they carry not their
forbearance so far.” This however he spake not out at once, but
by their professions and titles gave indication of it; “Tutor”
and “Father” being the terms which he employs.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiv-p18"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 4.15" id="iv.xiv-p18.1" parsed="|1Cor|4|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.4.15">Ver. 15</scripRef>. [4.] “For though,”
saith he, “ye have ten thousand tutors in Christ, yet have ye not
many fathers.” He is not here setting forth his dignity, but
the exceeding greatness of his love. Thus neither did he wound
the other teachers: since he adds the clause, “in Christ:”
but rather soothed them, designating not as parasites but as tutors
those among them who were zealous and patient of labor: and also
manifested his own anxious care of them. On this account he said
not, “Yet not many masters,” but, “not many fathers.” So
little was it his object to set down any name of dignity, or to
argue that of him they had received the greater benefit: but
granting to the others the great pains they had taken for the
Corinthians, (for that is the force of the word Tutor,) the
superiority in love he reserves for his own portion: for that
again is the force of the word Father.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiv-p19">And he saith not merely, No one loves you so much; a
statement which admitted not of being called in question; but he
also brings forward a real fact. What then is this? “For in
Christ Jesus I begat you through the Gospel. In Christ
Jesus.” Not unto myself do I impute this. Again, he strikes
at those who gave their own names to their teaching. For
“ye,” saith he, “are the seal of mine Apostleship.” And
again, “I planted:” and in this place, “I begat.” He
said not, “I preached the word,” but, “I begat;” using the
words of natural relationship. (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xiv-p19.1">τοῖς τῆς
φύσεως  ὀνόμασι</span>)  For his one
care at the moment was, to shew forth the love which he had for
them. “For they indeed received you from me, and led you on;
but that you are believers at all came to pass through me.”
Thus, because he had said, “as children;” lest you should
suppose that the expression was flattery he produces also the
matter of fact.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiv-p20"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 4.16" id="iv.xiv-p20.1" parsed="|1Cor|4|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.4.16">Ver. 16</scripRef>. [5.] “I beseech you, be
ye imitators of me, as I also am of Christ.” (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xiv-p20.2">κάθως κὰγὼ Χριστοῦ</span>, omitted in our version: the
Vulgate has it, see c. <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 11.1" id="iv.xiv-p20.3" parsed="|1Cor|11|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.11.1">xi. 1</scripRef>.) Astonishing!  How great
is our teacher’s boldness of speech!  How highly finished the
image, when he can even exhort others hereunto!  Not that in
self-exaltation he doth so, but implying that virtue is an easy
thing. As if he had said, “Tell me not, ‘I am not able to
imitate thee. Thou art a Teacher, and a great one.’ For the
difference between me and you is not so great as between Christ and
me: and yet I have imitated Him.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiv-p21">On the other hand, writing to the Ephesians, he
interposes no mention of himself, but leads them all straight to
the one point, “Be ye imitators of God,” is his word. (<scripRef passage="Ephes. v. 1" id="iv.xiv-p21.1" parsed="|Eph|5|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Eph.5.1">Ephes. v. 1</scripRef>.) But in this place, since
his discourse was addressed to weak persons, he puts himself in by
the way.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiv-p22">And besides, too, he signifies that it is possible
even thus to imitate Christ. For he who copies the perfect
impression of the seal, copies the original model.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiv-p23">Let us see then in what way he followed Christ: 
for this imitation needs not time and art, but a steady purpose
alone. Thus if we go into the study of a painter, we shall not be
able to copy the portrait, though we see it ten thousand times.
But to copy him we are enabled by hearing alone. Will ye then
that we bring the tablet before you and sketch out for you Paul’s
manner of life? Well, let it be produced, that picture far
brighter than all the images of Emperors: for its material is not
boards glued together, nor canvass stretched out; but the material
is the work of God: being as it is a soul and a body: a soul,
the work of God, not of men; and a body again in like wise.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiv-p24">Did you utter applause here? Nay, not here is the
time for plaudits; but in what follows: for applauding, I say,
and for imitating too: for so far we have but the material which
is common to all without exception: inasmuch as soul differs not
from soul in regard of its being a soul: but the purpose of heart
shews the difference. For as one body differs not from another in
so far as it is a body, but Paul’s body is like every one’s
else, only dangers make one body more brilliant than another: 
just so is it in the case of the soul also.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiv-p25">[6.] Suppose then our tablet to be the soul of
Paul: this tablet was lately lying covered with soot, full of
spider’s webs; (for nothing can be worse than blasphemy;) but
when He came who transformeth all things, and saw that not through
indolence or sluggishness were his lines so drawn but through
inexperience and his not having the tints (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xiv-p25.1">τὰ ἄνθη</span>) of true piety: 
<pb n="75" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_75.html" id="iv.xiv-Page_75" />(for zeal indeed he had, but the colors were not
there; for he had not “the zeal according to knowledge:”)  He
gives him the tint of the truth, that is, grace: and in a moment
he exhibited the imperial image. For having got the colors and
learnt what he was ignorant of, he waited no time, but forthwith
appeared a most excellent artist. And first he shews the head of
the king, preaching Christ; then also the remainder of the body;
the body of a perfect Christian life. Now painters we know shut
themselves up and execute all their works with great nicety and in
quiet; not opening the doors to any one: but this man, setting
forth his tablet in the view of the world, in the midst of
universal opposition, clamor, disturbance, did under such
circumstances work out this Royal Image, and was not hindered.
And therefore he said, “We are made a spectacle unto the
world;” in the midst of earth, and sea, and the heaven, and the
whole habitable globe, and the world both material and
intellectual, he was drawing that portrait of his.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiv-p26">Would you like to see the other parts also thereof
from the head downwards? Or will ye that from below we carry our
description upwards? Contemplate then a statue of gold or rather
of something more costly than gold, and such as might stand in
heaven; not fixed with lead nor placed in one spot, but hurrying
from Jerusalem even unto Illyricum, (<scripRef passage="Rom. xv. 19" id="iv.xiv-p26.1" parsed="|Rom|15|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.15.19">Rom. xv. 19</scripRef>.) and setting forth into
Spain, and borne as it were on wings over every part of the
world. For what could be more “beautiful” than these
“feet” which visited the whole earth under the sun? This same
“beauty” the prophet also from of old proclaimeth, saying,
(<scripRef passage="Is. lii. 7" id="iv.xiv-p26.2" parsed="|Isa|52|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.52.7">Is. lii. 7</scripRef>.) “How beautiful are the
feet of them that preach the Gospel of peace!” Hast thou seen
how fair are the feet? Wilt thou see the bosom too? Come, let
me shew thee this also, and thou shalt behold it far more splendid
than these beautiful, yea even than the bosom itself of the ancient
lawgiver. For Moses indeed carried tablets of stone: but this
man within him had Christ Himself: it was the very image of the
King which he bore.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiv-p27">For this cause he was more awful than the
Mercy Seat<note place="end" n="71" id="iv.xiv-p27.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xiv-p28">
That is, probably, “of our Lord’s Human Nature:” according
to Theodoret on <scripRef passage="Rom. iii. 25" id="iv.xiv-p28.1" parsed="|Rom|3|25|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.3.25">Rom. iii. 25</scripRef>. “The true Mercy Seat is the Lord
Christ. The name suits Him as man, not as God: for as God, He
Himself gives oracles from the Mercy Seat.” And Theophylact on
the same place: “It meant certainly the Human Nature, which was
the Sheath of the Deity, covering It over.” See Suicer on the
word <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xiv-p28.2">ἱ</span><span class="Greek" id="iv.xiv-p28.3">λαστήριον</span>. [This note is based upon a false
reading, which has been corrected according to Field. C.]</p></note> and the
Cherubim. For no such voice went out from them as from hence; but
from them it talked with men chiefly about things of sense, from
the tongue of Paul on the other hand about the things above the
heavens. Again, from the Mercy Seat it spake oracles to the Jews
alone; but from hence to the whole world: and there it was by
things without life; but here by a soul instinct with
virtue.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiv-p29">This Mercy Seat was brighter even than heaven, not
shining forth with variety of stars nor with rays from the sun, but
the very Sun of righteousness was there, and from hence He sent
forth His rays. Again, from time to time in this our heaven, any
cloud coursing over at times makes it gloomy; but that bosom never
had any such storm sweeping across it. Or rather there did sweep
over it many storms and oft: but the light they darkened not;
rather in the midst of the temptation and dangers the light shone
out. Wherefore also he himself when bound with his chain kept
exclaiming, (<scripRef passage="2 Tim. ii. 9" id="iv.xiv-p29.1" parsed="|2Tim|2|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Tim.2.9">2 Tim. ii.
9</scripRef>.) “The word of God is
not bound.” Thus continually by means of that tongue was It
sending forth its rays. And no fear, no danger made that bosom
gloomy. Perhaps the bosom seems to outdo the feet; however, both
they as feet are beautiful, and this as a bosom.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiv-p30">Wilt thou see also the belly with its proper
beauty? Hear what he saith about it, (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. 8.13" id="iv.xiv-p30.1" parsed="|1Cor|8|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.8.13">ch. viii.

13</scripRef>.) Meats for the belly
and the belly for meats.” What can be more beautiful in its
kind than this belly thus instructed to be quiet, and taught all
temperance, and knowing how both to hunger and be famished, and
also to suffer thirst? For as a well-trained horse with a golden
bridle, so also did this walk with measured paces, having
vanquished the necessity of nature. For it was Christ walking in
it. Now this being so temperate, it is quite plain that the whole
body of vice besides was done away.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiv-p31">Wouldst thou see the hands too? those which he now
hath? Or wouldest thou rather behold first their former
wickedness? (<scripRef passage="Acts viii. 3" id="iv.xiv-p31.1" parsed="|Acts|8|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.8.3">Acts viii.
3</scripRef>.) “Entering (this
very man) into the houses, he haled,” of late, “men and
women,” with the hands not of man, but of some fierce wild
beast. But as soon as he had received the colors of the Truth and
the spiritual experience, no longer were these the hands of a man,
but spiritual; day by day being bound with chains. And they never
struck any one, but they were stricken times without number. Once
even a viper (<scripRef passage="Acts xxviii. 3, 5" id="iv.xiv-p31.2" parsed="|Acts|28|3|0|0;|Acts|28|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.28.3 Bible:Acts.28.5">Acts xxviii.

hands: for they were the hands of a human being no longer; and
therefore it did not even fasten on them.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiv-p32">And wilt thou see also the back, resembling as it
does the other members? Hear what he saith about this also.

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiv-p33">[7.] But lest we too should fall into an
interminable deep, and be carried away far and wide, going over
each of his members severally; come let us quit the body and look
at another sort of beauty, that, namely, which proceeds from his
garments; to which even devils shewed reverence; and therefore both
they made off, and diseases took flight. And wheresoever Paul
happened to shew himself, they all retired and got out of the way,
as if the champion of the whole world had appeared. And as they
who have been often wounded in war, should they see but some part
of the armor of him that wounded them feel a shuddering; much in
the same way the devils also, at sight of “handkerchiefs” only
were astonied. Where be now the rich, and they that have high
thoughts about wealth? Where they who count over their own titles
and their costly robes? With these things if they compare
themselves, it will be clay in their sight and dirt, all they have
of their own. And why speak I of garments and golden ornaments? 
Why, if one would grant me the whole world in possession, the mere
nail of Paul I should esteem more powerful than all that
dominion: his poverty than all luxury: his dishonor, than all
glory: his nakedness than all riches: no security would I
compare with the buffeting of that sacred head: no diadem, with
the stones to which he was a mark. This crown let us long for,
beloved: and if persecution be not now, let us mean while prepare
ourselves. For neither was he of whom we speak glorious by
persecutions alone: for he said also, (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. ix. 27" id="iv.xiv-p33.1" parsed="|1Cor|9|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.9.27">1 Cor. ix. 27</scripRef>. <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xiv-p33.2">ὑποπιέζω</span>

this one may attain excellence without persecutions. And he
exhorted not to (<scripRef passage="Rom. iii. 14" id="iv.xiv-p33.4" parsed="|Rom|3|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.3.14">Rom. iii.

for the flesh to fulfill the lusts thereof.” And again, (<scripRef passage="1 Tim. vi. 8" id="iv.xiv-p33.5" parsed="|1Tim|6|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.6.8">1 Tim. vi. 8</scripRef>.) “Having food and covering,
let us be therewith content.” For to these purposes we have no
need of persecutions. And the wealthy too he sought to moderate,
saying, (<scripRef passage="1 Tim. 6.9" id="iv.xiv-p33.6" parsed="|1Tim|6|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.6.9">Ibid. 9</scripRef>.)
“They that desire to be rich fall into temptation.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiv-p34">If therefore we also thus exercise ourselves, when
we enter into the contest we shall be crowned: and though there
be no persecution before us, we shall receive for these things many
rewards. But if we pamper the body and live the life of a swine,
even in peace we shall often sin and bear shame.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiv-p35">Seest thou not with whom we wrestle? With the
incorporeal powers. How then, being ourselves flesh, are we to
get the better of these? For if wrestling with men one have need
to be temperate in diet, much more with evil spirits. But when
together with fulness of flesh we are also bound down to wealth,
whence are we to overcome our antagonists? For wealth is a chain,
a grievous chain, to those who know not how to use it; a tyrant
savage and inhuman, imposing all his commands by way of outrage on
those who serve him. Howbeit, if we will, this bitter tyranny we
shall depose from its throne, and make it yield to us, instead of
commanding. How then shall this be? By distributing our wealth
unto all. For so long as it stands against us, each single
handed, like any robber in a wilderness it works all its bad
ends: but when we bring it forth among others, it will master us
no more, holden as it will be in chains, on all sides, by all
men.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiv-p36">[8.] And these things I say, not because riches
are a sin: the sin is in not distributing them to the poor, and
in the wrong use of them. For God made nothing evil but all
things very good; so that riches too are good; i.e. if they do not
master their owners; if the wants of our neighbors be done away by
them. For neither is that light good which instead of dissipating
darkness rather makes it intense: nor should I call that wealth,
which instead of doing away poverty rather increases it. For the
rich man seeks not to take from others but to help others: but he
that seeks to receive from others is no longer rich, but is
emphatically poor. So that it is not riches that are an evil, but
the needy mind which turns wealth into poverty. These are more
wretched than those who ask alms in the narrow streets, carrying a
wallet and mutilated in body. I say, clothed in rags as they are,
not so miserable as those in silks and shining garments. Those
who strut in the market-place are more to be pitied than those who
haunt the crossings of the streets, and enter into the courts, and
cry from their cellars, and ask charity. For these for their part
do utter praises to God, and speak words of mercy and a strict
morality. And therefore we pity them, and stretch out the hand,
and never find fault with them. But those who are rich to bad
purpose; cruelty and inhumanity, ravening and satanical lust, are
in the words they belch out. And therefore by all are they
detested and laughed to scorn. Do but consider; which of the two
among all men is reckoned disgraceful, to beg of the rich or the
poor. Every one, I suppose, sees it at once:—of the poor. Now
this, if you mark it, is what the rich do; for they durst not apply
to those who are richer than themselves: whereas those who beg do
so of the wealthy: for one beggar asks not alms of another, but
of a rich man; but the rich man tears the poor in pieces.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiv-p37">Again tell me, which is the more dignified, to
receive from those who are willing and are obliged to you, or when
men are unwilling, to <pb n="77" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_77.html" id="iv.xiv-Page_77" />compel
and tease them? Clearly not to trouble those who are unwilling.
But this also the rich do: for the poor receive from willing
hands, and such as are obliged to them; but the rich from persons
unwilling and repugnant, which is an indication of greater
poverty. For if no one would like so much as to go to a meal,
unless the inviter were to feel obliged to the guest, how can it be
honorable to take one’s share of any property by compulsion? Do
we not on this account get out of the way of dogs and fly from
their baying, because by their much besetting they fairly force us
off? This also our rich men do.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiv-p38">“But, that fear should accompany the gift, is more
dignified.” Nay, this is of all most disgraceful. For he who
moves heaven and earth about his gains, who can be so laughed to
scorn as he? For even unto dogs, not seldom, through fear, we
throw whatever we had hold of. Which I ask again, is more
disgraceful? that one clothed with rags should beg, or one who
wears silk? Thus when a rich man pays court to old and poor
persons, so as to get possession of their property, and this when
there are children, what pardon can he deserve?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiv-p39">Further: If you will, let us examine the very
words; what the rich beggars say, and what the poor. What then
saith the poor man? “That he who giveth alms will never have to
give by measure (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xiv-p39.1">μετριάσει</span>
perhaps corrupt:  conj. <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xiv-p39.2"> πεινάσει</span>, “will never hunger); that he is giving of what
is God’s: that God is loving unto men, and recompenses more
abundantly; all which are words of high morality, and exhortation,
and counsel. For he recommends thee to look unto the Lord, and he
takes away thy fear of the poverty to come. And one may perceive
much instruction in the words of those who ask alms: but of what
kind are those of the rich? Why, of swine, and dogs, and wolves,
and all other wild beasts. For some of them discourse perpetually
on banquets, and dishes, and delicacies, and wine of all sorts, and
ointments, and vestures, and all the rest of that extravagance.
And others about the interest of money and loans. And making out
accounts and increasing the mass of debts to an intolerable amount,
as if it had begun in the time of men’s fathers or grandfathers,
one they rob of his house, another of his field, and another of his
slave, and of all that he has. Why should one speak of their
wills, which are written in blood instead of ink? For either by
surrounding them with some intolerable danger, or else bewitching
them with some paltry promises, whomsoever they may see in
possession of some small property, those they persuade to pass by
all their relations, and that oftentimes when perishing through
poverty, and instead of them to enter their own names. Is there
any madness and ferocity of wild beasts of any sort which these
things do not throw into the shade?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xiv-p40">[8.] Wherefore I beseech you, all such wealth as
this let us flee, disgraceful as it is and in deaths abundant; and
let us obtain that which is spiritual, and let us seek after the
treasures in the heavens. For whoso possess these, they are the
rich, they are the wealthy, both here and there enjoying things;
even all things. Since whoso will be poor, according to the word
of God, has all men’s houses opened to him. For unto him that
for God’s sake has ceased to possess any thing, every one will
contribute of his own. But whoso will hold a little with
injustice, shutteth the doors of all against him. To the end,
then, that we may attain both to the good things here and to those
which are there, let us choose the wealth which cannot be removed,
that immortal abundance: which may God grant us all to obtain,
through the grace and loving-kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ,

<p class="c24" id="iv.xv-p5"><span class="c18" id="iv.xv-p5.1">Consider</span> here also, I
entreat, the noble soul, the soul more glowing and keener than
fire: how he was indeed especially desirous to be present himself
with the Corinthians, thus distempered and broken into parties.
For he knew well what a help to the disciples his presence was and
what a mischief his absence. And the former he declared in the
Epistle to the Philippians, saying, (<scripRef passage="Philipp. 2.12" id="iv.xv-p5.2" parsed="|Phil|2|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Phil.2.12">Phil. ii. 12</scripRef>. <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xv-p5.3"> καὶ[]</span> om. in rec. text.)
“Not as in my presence only, but also now much more in my
absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.”
The latter he signifies in this Epistle, saying, (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. 4.18" id="iv.xv-p5.4" parsed="|1Cor|4|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.4.18">ver. <pb n="78" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_78.html" id="iv.xv-Page_78" />18</scripRef>.) “Now some are puffed up,
as though I were not coming to you; but I will come.” He was
urgent, it seems, and desirous to be present himself. But as this
was not possible for a time, he corrects them by the promise of his
appearance; and not this only, but also by the sending of his
disciple. “For this,” he saith, “I have sent unto you
Timothy.” “For this cause:” how is that? “Because I
care for you as for children, and as having begotten you.” And
the message is accompanied with a recommendation of his person: 
“Who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord.” Now this
he said, both to shew his love of him, and to prepare them to look
on him with respect. And not simply “faithful,” but, “in
the Lord;” that is, in the things pertaining to the Lord.  Now
if in worldly things it is high praise for a man to be faithful,
much more in things spiritual.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xv-p6">If then he was his “beloved child,” consider how
great was Paul’s love, in choosing to be separated from him for
the Corinthian’s sake, And if “faithful” also, he will be
unexceptionable in his ministering to their affairs.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xv-p7">“Who shall put you in remembrance.” He said
not, “shall teach,” lest they should take it ill, as being used
to learn from himself. Wherefore also towards the end he saith,
(<scripRef passage="1 Cor. xvi. 10, 11" id="iv.xv-p7.1" parsed="|1Cor|16|10|16|11" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.16.10-1Cor.16.11">1 Cor. xvi. 10, 11</scripRef>.) “For he worketh the work
of the Lord, as I also do. Let no man therefore despise him.”
For there was no envy among the Apostles, but they had an eye unto
one thing, the edification of the Church. And if he that was
employed was their inferior, they did as it were support (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xv-p7.2">συνεκρότουν</span>) him with all
earnestness. Wherefore neither was he contented with saying,
“He shall put you in remembrance;” but purposing to cut out
their envy more completely,—for Timothy was young,—with this
view, I say, he adds, “my ways;” not “his,” but “mine;”
that is, his methods, (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xv-p7.3">τὰς
οἰκονομίας</span>.) his dangers, his
customs, his laws, his ordinances, his Apostolical Canons, and all
the rest. For since he had said, “We are naked, and are
buffered, and have no certain dwelling place: all these
things,” saith he, “he will remind you of;” and also of the
laws of Christ; for destroying all heresies. Then, carrying his
argument higher, he adds, “which be in Christ;” ascribing all,
as was his wont, unto the Lord, and on that ground establishing the
credibility of what is to follow. Wherefore he subjoins, “Even
as I teach every where in every church.” “Nothing new have I
spoken unto you: of these my proceedings all the other Churches
are cognizant as well as you.” Further: he calls them “ways
in Christ,” to shew that they have in them nothing human, and
that with the aid from that source he doth all things well.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xv-p8">[2.] And having said these things and so soothed
them, and being just about to enter on his charge against the
unclean person, he again utters words full of anger; not that in
himself he felt so but in order to correct them: and giving over
the fornicator, he directs his discourse to the rest, as not
deeming him worthy even of words from himself; just as we act in
regard to our servants when they have given us great offence.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xv-p9">Next, after that he had said, “I send Timothy,
lest they should thereupon take things too easily, mark what he
saith:</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xv-p10"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 4.18" id="iv.xv-p10.1" parsed="|1Cor|4|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.4.18">Ver. 18</scripRef>. “Now some are puffed up,
as though I were not coming unto you.” For there he glances
both at them and at certain others, casting down their
highmindedness: since the love of preeminence is in fault, when
men abuse the absence of their teacher for their own self-will.
For when he addresses himself unto the people, observe how he does
it by way of appeal to their sense of shame; when unto the
originators of the mischief, his manner is more vehement. Thus
unto the former he saith, “We are the offscouring of all:”
and soothing them he saith, “Not to shame you I write these
things;” but to the latter, “Now as though I were not coming to
you, some are puffed up;” shewing that their self-will argued a
childish turn of mind. For so boys in the absence of their master
wax more negligent.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xv-p11">This then is one thing here indicated; and another
is that his presence was sufficient for their correction. For as
the presence of a lion makes all living creatures shrink away, so
also does that of Paul the corrupters of the Church.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xv-p12"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 4.19" id="iv.xv-p12.1" parsed="|1Cor|4|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.4.19">Ver. 19</scripRef>. And therefore he goes on,
“But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will.” Now to
say this only would seem to be mere threatening. But to promise
himself and demand from them the requisite proof by actions also;
this was a course for a truly high spirit. Accordingly he added
this too, saying,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xv-p13">“And I will know, not the word of them which are
puffed up, but the power.” For not from any excellencies of
their own but from their teacher’s absence, this self-will
arose. Which again itself was a mark of a scornful mind towards
him. And this is why, having said, “I have sent Timothy,” he
did not at once add, “I will come;” but waited until he had
brought his charge against them of being “puffed up:” after
that he saith, “I will come.” Since, had he put it before the
charge, it would rather have been an apology for himself as not
having been deficient, instead of a threat; nor even so (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xv-p13.1">οὕτως</span> so the King’s <span class="c18" id="iv.xv-p13.2">ms</span>. <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xv-p13.3"> οὖτος</span> the rec. text.) would the statement have been
convincing. <pb n="79" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_79.html" id="iv.xv-Page_79" />But as it is,
placing it after the accusation, he rendered himself such as they
would both believe and fear.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xv-p14">Mark also how solid and secure he makes his
ground: for he saith not simply, “I will come:” but, “If
the Lord will:” and he appoints no set time. For since he
might perhaps be tardy in coming, by that uncertainty he would fain
keep them anxiously engaged. And, lest they should hereupon fall
back again, he added, “shortly,”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xv-p15">[3.] “And I will know, not the word of them that
are puffed up, but the power.” He said not, “I will know not
the wisdom, nor the signs,” but what? “not the word:” by
the term he employs at the same time depressing the one and
exalting the other. And for a while he is setting himself against
the generality of them who were countenancing the fornicator. For
if he were speaking of him, he would not say, “the power;” but,
“the works,” the corrupt works which he did.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xv-p16">Now why seekest thou not after “the word?”
“Not because I am wanting in word but because all our doings are
‘in power.’” As therefore in war success is not for those
who talk much but those who effect much; so also in this case, not
speakers, but doers have the victory. “Thou,” saith he,
“art proud of this fine speaking. Well, if it were a contest
and a time for orators, thou mightest reasonably be elated
thereat: but if of Apostles preaching truth, and by signs
confirming the same, why art thou puffed up for a thing superfluous
and unreal, and to the present purpose utterly inefficient? For
what could a display of words avail towards raising the dead, or
expelling evil spirits, or working any other such deed of wonder? 
But these are what we want now, and by these our cause stands.”
Whereupon also he adds,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xv-p17"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 4.20" id="iv.xv-p17.1" parsed="|1Cor|4|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.4.20">Ver. 20</scripRef>. “For the kingdom of God
is not in word, but in power.” By signs, saith he, not by fine
speaking, we have prevailed: and that our teaching is divine and
really announces the Kingdom of Heaven we give the greater proof,
namely, our signs which we work by the power of the Spirit. If
those who are now puffed up desire to be some great ones; as soon
as I am come, let them shew whether they have any such power. And
let me not find them sheltering themselves behind a pomp of
words: for that kind of art is nothing to us.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xv-p18">[4.] <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 4.21" id="iv.xv-p18.1" parsed="|1Cor|4|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.4.21">Ver. 21</scripRef>. “What will ye? Shall I
come unto you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of
meekness?”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xv-p19">There is much both of terror and of gentleness in
this saying. For to say, “I will know,” was the language of
one as yet withholding himself: but to say, “What will ye? 
Must I come unto you with a rod?” are the words of one
thenceforth ascending the teacher’s seat, and from thence holding
discourses with them and taking upon him all his authority.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xv-p20">What means, “with a rod?” With punishment,
with vengeance: that is, I will destroy; I will strike with
blindness: the kind of thing which Peter did in the case of
Sapphira, and himself in the case of Elymas the sorcerer. For
henceforth he no longer speaks as bringing himself into a close
comparison with the other teachers, but with authority. And in
the second Epistle too he appears to say the same, when he writes,
“Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xv-p21">“Shall I come with a rod, or in love?”
What then? to come with a rod, was it not an instance of love? Of
love it was surely<note place="end" n="73" id="iv.xv-p21.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xv-p22">
St. Augustin, <i>cont. Parmen</i>, iii. 3. “Are we to
suppose that “<i>the rod</i>” at all excludes
“<i>love</i>,” because he has given this turn to his sentence,
‘Shall I come unto you with a rod,’ <i>or</i> ‘in love?’
Nay, the following clause, ‘And in a spirit of meekness,’ hints
what was passing in his mind—that the rod also has in it love.
But love in severity is one thing, love in meekness another
thing. The love is the same, but it works diversely in divers
cases.”</p></note>. But because
through his great love he shrinks back in punishing, therefore he
so expresses himself.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xv-p23">Further; when he spoke about punishment, he said
not, “in a spirit of meekness,” but, [simply,] “with a
rod:” and yet of that too the Spirit was author. For there is
a spirit of meekness, and a spirit of severity. He doth not,
however, choose so to call it, but from its milder aspect (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xv-p23.1">ἀπὸ τῶν
χρηστοτέρων</span>.) And for a like reason also, God,
although avenging Himself, has it often affirmed of Him that He is
“gracious and long-suffering, and rich in mercy and pity:”
but that He is apt to punish, once perhaps or twice, and sparingly,
and that upon some urgent cause.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xv-p24">[5.] Consider then the wisdom of Paul; holding the
authority in his own hands, he leaves both his and that in the
power of others, saying, “What will ye?” “The matter is at
your disposal.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xv-p25">For we too have depending on us both sides of the
alternative; both falling into hell, and obtaining the kingdom: 
since God hath so willed it. For, “behold,” saith he, “fire
and water: whichever way thou wilt, thou mayest stretch forth
thine hand” (<scripRef passage="Ecclesiasticus 15.16" id="iv.xv-p25.1" parsed="|Sir|15|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Sir.15.16">Ecclus. xv. 16</scripRef>.) And, “If ye be willing,
and will hearken unto me, ye shall eat the good of the land; (<scripRef passage="Is. i. 19" id="iv.xv-p25.2" parsed="|Isa|1|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.1.19">Is. i. 19</scripRef>,) but if ye be not willing,
the sword shall devour you.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xv-p26">But perhaps one will say, “I am willing; (and no
one is so void of understanding as not to be willing;) but to will
is not sufficient for me.” Nay, but it is sufficient, if thou
be duly willing, and do the deeds of one that is willing. But as
it is, thou art not greatly willing.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xv-p27">And let us try this in other things, if it seem
good. For tell me, he that would marry a wife, is he content with
wishing? By no means; but <pb n="80" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_80.html" id="iv.xv-Page_80" />he
looks out for women to advance his suit, and request friends to
keep watch with him, and gets together money. Again, the merchant
is not content with sitting at home and wishing, but he first hires
a vessel, then selects sailors and rowers, then takes up money on
interest, and is inquisitive about a market and the price of
merchandise. Is it not then strange for men to shew themselves so
much in earnest about earthly things, but that when they are to
make a venture for heaven, they should be content with wishing
only? rather I should say, not even in this do they shew themselves
properly in earnest. For he that wills a thing as he ought, puts
also his hand unto the means which lead to the object of his
desire. Thus, when hunger compels thee to take nourishment, thou
waitest not for the viands to come unto thee of their own accord,
but omittest nothing to gather victuals together. So in thirst,
and cold and all other such things, thou art industrious and duly
prepared to take care of the body. Now do this in respect of
God’s kingdom also, and surely thou shalt obtain it.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xv-p28">For to this end God made thee a free agent, that
thou mightest not afterwards accuse God, as though some necessity
had bound thee: but thou, in regard of those very things wherein
thou hast been honored, dost murmur.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xv-p29">For in fact I have often heard people say, “But
why did He then make my goodness depend on me?” Nay, but how
was He to bring thee, slumbering and sleeping, and in love with all
iniquity, and living delicately, and pampering thyself; how was He
to bring thee up to heaven? If He had, thou wouldest not have
abstained from vice. For if now, even in the face of threatening,
thou dost not turn aside from thy wickedness; had he added no less
than heaven as the end of thy race, when wouldest thou have ceased
waxing more careless and worse by far? (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xv-p29.1">χείρων  πολλῷ. πολλῶν</span> Bened.)</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xv-p30">Neither again wilt thou be able to allege, He hath
shewed me indeed what things were good but gave no help, for
abundant also is His promise to thee of aid.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xv-p31">[6.] “But,” say you, “Virtue is burdensome
and distasteful; while with vice great pleasure is blended; and the
one is wide and broad, but the other strait and narrow.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xv-p32">Tell me then, are they respectively such throughout,
or only from the beginning? For in fact what thou here sayest,
thou sayest, not intending it, in behalf of virtue; so potent a
thing is truth. For suppose there were two roads, the one leading
to a furnace, and the other to a Paradise; and that the one unto
the furnace were broad, the other unto Paradise, narrow; which road
wouldest thou take in preference? For although you may now
gainsay for contradiction’s sake, yet things which are plainly
allowed on all hands, however shameless, you will not be able to
gainsay. Now that that way is rather to be chosen which hath its
beginning difficult but not its end, I will endeavor to teach you
from what is quite obvious. And, if you please, let us first take
in hand the arts. For these have their beginning full of toil,
but the end gainful. “But,” say you, “no one applies
himself to an art without some one to compel him; for,” you add,
“so long as the boy is his own master, he will choose rather to
take his ease at first, and in the end to endure the evil, how
great soever, than to live hardly at the outset, and afterwards
reap the fruit of those labors.” Well then, to make such a
choice comes of a mind left to itself, (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xv-p32.1">ὀρφανικῆς
διανοίας</span>) and of childish
idleness: but the contrary choice, of sense and manliness. And
so it is with us: were we not children in mind, we should not be
like the child aforesaid, forsaken (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xv-p32.2">ὀρφάνῳ</span>) as
he is and thoughtless, but like him that hath a father. We must
cast out then our own childish mind, and not find fault with the
things themselves; and we must set a charioteer over our
conscience, who will not allow us to indulge our appetite, but make
us run and strive mightily. For what else but absurdity is it to
inure our children with pains at first unto pursuits which have
laborious beginnings, but their end good and pleasant; while we
ourselves in spiritual things take just the contrary turn?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xv-p33">And yet even in those earthly things it is not quite
plain that the end will be good and pleasant: since before now
untimely death, or poverty, or false accusation, or reverse of
fortune, or other such things, of which there are many, have caused
men after their long toil to be deprived of all its fruits. What
is more, those who have such pursuits, though they succeed, it is
no great gain which they will reap. For with the present life all
those things are dissolved. But here, not for such fruitless and
perishable things is our race, neither have we fears about the end;
but greater and more secure is our hope after our departure
hence. What pardon then can there be, what excuse for those who
will not strip themselves for the evils to be endured for
virtue’s sake?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xv-p34">And do they yet ask, “Wherefore is the way
narrow?” Why, thou dost not deem it right that any fornicator
or lewd or drunken (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xv-p34.1">και τῶν  μεθυόντων</span> inserted from the King’s <span class="c18" id="iv.xv-p34.2">ms.</span>) person should enter into the courts of
earthly kings; and claimest thou for men to be let into heaven
itself with licentiousness, and luxury, and drunkenness, and
covetousness, and all manner of iniquity? And how can these
things be pardonable?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xv-p35"><pb n="81" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_81.html" id="iv.xv-Page_81" />[7.] 
“Nay,” you reply, “I say not that, but why has not virtue a
“broad way?” In good truth if we be willing, its way is very
easy. For whether is easier, tell me; to dig through a wall and
take other men’s goods and so be cast into prison; or to be
content with what you have and freed from all fear? I have not
however said all. For whether is easier, tell me; to steal all
men’s goods and revel in few of them for a short time, and then
to be racked and scourged eternally; or having lived in righteous
poverty for a short time, to live ever after in delights? (For
let us not enquire as yet which is the more profitable, but for the
present, which is the more easy.) Whether again is it pleasanter,
to see a good dream and to be punished in reality; or after having
had a disagreeable dream to be really in enjoyment? Of course the
latter. Tell me then, In what sense dost thou call virtue
harsh? I grant, it is harsh, tried by comparison with our
carelessness. However, that it is really easy and smooth, hear
what Christ saith, (St. 
<scripRef passage="Matt. xi. 30" id="iv.xv-p35.1" parsed="|Matt|11|30|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.11.30">Matt. xi. 30</scripRef>.) “My yoke is easy, and My
burden is light.” But if thou perceivest not the lightness,
plainly it is for want of courageous zeal; since where that is,
even heavy things are light; and by the same rule where it is not,
even light things are heavy. For tell me, what could be sweeter
and more easily obtained than the banquet of manna? Yet the Jews
were discontented, though enjoying such delightful fare. What
more bitter than hunger and all the other hardships which Paul
endured? Yet he leaped up, and rejoiced, and said, (<scripRef passage="Col. i. 24" id="iv.xv-p35.2" parsed="|Col|1|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Col.1.24">Col. i. 24</scripRef>.) “Now I rejoice in my
sufferings.” What then is the cause? The difference of the
mind. If then you frame this as it ought to be, you will see the
easiness of virtue.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xv-p36">“What then,” say you, “does she only become
such through the mind of those who pursue her?” She is such,
not from their mind alone, but by nature as well. Which I thus
prove: If the one had been throughout a thing painful, the other
throughout of the contrary sort, then with some plausibility might
some fallen persons have said that the latter was easier than the
former. But if they have their beginnings, the one in hardship,
the other in pleasure, but their respective ends again just
opposite to these; and if those ends be both infinite, in the one
the pleasure, in the other the burthen; tell me, which is the more
easy to choose?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xv-p37">“Why then do many not choose that which is
easy?” Because some disbelieve; and others, who believe, have
their judgment corrupt, and would prefer pleasure for a season to
that which is everlasting. “Is not this then easy?” Not
so: but this cometh of a sick soul. And as the reason why
persons in a fever long after cool drink is not upon calculation
that the momentary luxury is pleasanter than being burned up from
beginning to end, but because they cannot restrain their inordinate
desire; so also these. Since if one brought them to their
punishment at the very moment of their pleasure, assuredly they
never would have chosen it. Thus you see in what sense vice is
not an easy thing.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xv-p38">[8.] But if you will, let us try this same point
over again by an example in the proper subject matter. Tell me,
for instance, which is pleasanter and easier? (only let us not
take again the desire of the many for our rule in the matter; since
one ought to decide, not by the sick, but by the whole; just as you
might show me ten thousand men in a fever, seeking things
unwholesome upon choice to suffer for it afterwards; but I should
not allow such choice;) which, I repeat, brings more ease, tell me;
to desire much wealth, or to be above that desire? For I, for my
part, think the latter. If thou disbelieve it, let the argument
be brought to the facts themselves.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xv-p39">Let us then suppose one man desiring much, another
nothing. Which now is the better state, tell me, and which the
more respectable? However, let that pass. For this is agreed
upon, that the latter is a finer character than the former. And
we are making no enquiry about this at present, but which lives the
easier and pleasanter life? Well then: the lover of money will
not enjoy even what he has: for that which he loves he cannot
choose to spend; but would gladly even carve (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xv-p39.1">κατακόψειε</span>) himself out, and part with his
flesh rather than with his gold. But he that despises wealth,
gains this the while, that he enjoys what he has quietly and with
great security, and that he values himself more than it. Which
then is the pleasanter; to enjoy what one has with freedom, or to
live under a master, namely wealth, and not dare to touch a single
thing even of one’s own? Why, it seemeth to me to be much the
same as if any two men, having wives and loving them exceedingly,
were not upon the same terms with them; but the one were allowed
the presence and intercourse of his wife, the other not even
permitted to come near his.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xv-p40">There is another thing which I wish to mention,
indicating the pleasure of the one and the discomfort of the
other. He that is greedy of gain will never be stayed in that
desire, not only because it is impossible, for him to obtain all
men’s goods, but also because whatever he may have compassed, he
counts himself to have nothing. But the despiser of riches will
deem it all superfluous, and will not have to punish his soul with
endless desires. I say, punish; for nothing so completely answers
<pb n="82" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_82.html" id="iv.xv-Page_82" />the definition of punishment as
desire deprived of gratification; a thing too which especially
marks his perverse mind. Look at it in this way. He that lusts
after riches and hath increased his store, he is the sort of person
to feel as if he had nothing. I ask then, what more complicated
than this disease? And the strange thing is not this only, but
that although having, he thinks he has not the very things which
are in his hold, and as though he had them not he bewails
himself. If he even get all men’s goods, his pain is but
greater. And should he gain an hundred talents, he is vexed that
he hath not received a thousand: and if he received a thousand;
he is stung to the quick that it is not ten thousand: and if he
receive ten thousand, he utterly bemoans himself (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xv-p40.1">κατακόπτεται</span>) because it is not ten times
as much. And the acquisition of more to him becomes so much more
poverty; for the more he receives so much the more he desires. So
then, the more he receives, the more he becomes poor: since whoso
desires more, is more truly poor. When then he hath an hundred
talents, is he not very poor?<note place="end" n="74" id="iv.xv-p40.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xv-p41">
Savile reads this interrogatively, [as does also Dr. Field.
C.]</p></note>
for he desires a thousand. When he hath got a thousand, then he
becomes yet poorer. For it is no longer a thousand as before, but
ten thousand that he professes himself to want. Now if you say
that to wish and not to obtain is pleasure, you seem to me to be
very ignorant of the nature of pleasure.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xv-p42">[9.] To shew that this sort of thing is not
pleasure but punishment, take another case, and so let us search it
out. When we are thirsty, do we not therefore feel pleasure in
drinking because we quench our thirst; and is it not therefore a
pleasure to drink because it relieves us from a great torment, the
desire, I mean, of drinking? Every one, I suppose, can tell.
But were we always to remain in such a state of desire, we should
be as badly off as the rich man in the parable of Lazarus for the
matter of punishment; for his punishment was just this that
vehemently desiring one little drop, he obtained it not. And this
very thing all covetous persons seem to me continually to suffer,
and to resemble him where he begs that he may obtain that drop, and
obtains it not. For their soul is more on fire than his.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xv-p43">Well indeed hath one<note place="end" n="75" id="iv.xv-p43.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xv-p44">
<i>Crescit indulgens sibi dirus Hydrops, Nec sitim pellit, nisi
causa morbi Fugerit venis, et aquosus albo corpore
languor</i>. <span class="c18" id="iv.xv-p44.1">Hor</span>. <i>Carm</i>. ii.
2.</p></note> said, that all lovers of money are
in a sort of dropsy; for as they, bearing much water in their
bodies, are the more burnt up: so also the covetous, bearing
about with them great wealth, are greedy of more. The reason is
that neither do the one keep the water in the parts of the body
where it should be, nor the other their desire in the limits of
becoming thought.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xv-p45">Let us then flee this strange and craving (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xv-p45.1">ξένην  καὶ κενὴν</span>: a play on
the sound of the words,) disease; let us flee the root of all
evils; let us flee that which is present hell; for it is a hell,
the desire of these things. Only just lay open the soul of each,
of him who despises wealth and of him who does not so; and you will
see that the one is like the distracted, choosing neither to hear
nor see any thing: the other, like a harbor free from waves: 
and he is the friend of all, as the other is the enemy. For
whether one take any thing of his, it gives him no annoyance; or if
whether, on the contrary, one give him aught, it puffs him not up;
but there is a certain freedom about him with entire security.
The one is forced to flatter and feign before all; the other, to no
man.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xv-p46">If now to be fond of money is to be both poor and
timid and a dissembler and a hypocrite and to be full of fears and
great penal anguish and chastisement: while he that despises
wealth has all the contrary enjoyments: is it not quite plain
that virtue is the more pleasant?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xv-p47">Now we might have gone through all the other evils
also whereby it is shewn that there is no vice which hath pleasure
in it, had we not spoken before so much at large.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xv-p48">Wherefore knowing these things, let us choose
virtue; to the end that we may both enjoy such pleasure as is here,
and may attain unto the blessings which are to come, through the
grace and loving-kindness, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p class="c27" id="iv.xvi-p3">It is actually reported that there is fornication
among you, and such fornication as is not even named among the
Gentiles, that one of you hath his father’s wife. And ye are
puffed up, and did not rather mourn, that he that had done this
deed might be taken away from among you.</p>

<p class="c24" id="iv.xvi-p4"><span class="c18" id="iv.xvi-p4.1">When</span> he was discoursing
about their divisions, he did not indeed at once address them
vehemently, but more gently at first; and afterwards, he ended in
accusation, saying thus, (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. 1.11" id="iv.xvi-p4.2" parsed="|1Cor|1|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.1.11">c. 1. xi</scripRef>.) “For it hath been
signified unto me concerning you, my brethren, by them which are of
the household of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.”
But in this place, not so; but he lays about him immediately and
makes the reproach of the accusation as general as possible. For
he said not, “Why did such an one commit fornication?” but,
“It is reported that there is fornication among you;” that they
might as persons altogether aloof from his charge take it easily;
but might be filled with such anxiety as was natural when the whole
body was wounded, and the Church had incurred reproach. “For no
one,” saith he, “will state it thus, ‘such an one hath
committed fornication,’ but, ‘in the Church of Corinthians that
sin hath been committed.’”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvi-p5">And he said not, “Fornication is perpetrated,”
but, “Is reported,—such as is not even named among the
Gentiles.” For so continually he makes the Gentiles a topic of
reproach to the believers. Thus writing to the Thessalonians, he
said, (<scripRef passage="1 Thess. iv. 4, 5" id="iv.xvi-p5.1" parsed="|1Thess|4|4|4|5" osisRef="Bible:1Thess.4.4-1Thess.4.5">1 Thess. iv. 4,
5</scripRef>, <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xvi-p5.2">καὶ τιμῆ</span> om. <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xvi-p5.3"> τὰ λοιπὰ</span> inserted.)
“Let every one possess himself of his own vessel in
sanctification, not in the passion of lust, even as the rest of the
Gentiles.” And to the Colossians and Ephesians, (<scripRef passage="Eph. 4.17; Col. 3.6,7" id="iv.xvi-p5.4" parsed="|Eph|4|17|0|0;|Col|3|6|3|7" osisRef="Bible:Eph.4.17 Bible:Col.3.6-Col.3.7">Ephes. iv. 17. cf. Col. iii. 6, 7</scripRef>.) “That you should no longer
walk, as the other Gentiles walk.” Now if their committing the
same sins was unpardonable, when they even outdid the Gentiles,
what place can we find for them? tell me: “inasmuch as among
the Gentiles,” so he speaks, “not only they dare no such thing,
but they do not even give it a name. Do you see to what point he
aggravated his charge? For when they are convicted of inventing
such modes of uncleanness as the unbelievers, so far from venturing
on them, do not even know of, the sin must be exceeding great,
beyond all words. And the clause, “among you,” is spoken also
emphatically; that is, “Among you, the faithful, who have been
favored with so high mysteries, the partakers of secrets, the
guests invited to heaven.” Dost thou mark with what indignant
feeling his works overflow? with what anger against all? For had
it not been for the great wrath of which he was full, had he not
been setting himself against them all, he would have spoken thus: 
“Having heard that such and such a person hath committed
fornication, I charge you to punish him.” But as it is he doth
not so; he rather challenges all at once. And indeed, if they had
written first, this is what he probably would have said. Since
however so far from writing, they had even thrown the fault into
the shade, on this account he orders his discourse more
vehemently.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvi-p6">[2.] “That one of you should have his father’s
wife.” Wherefore said he not, “That he should abuse his
father’s wife?” The extreme foulness of the deed caused him
to shrink. He hurries by it accordingly, with a sort of
scrupulousness as though it had been explicitly mentioned before.
And hereby again he aggravates the charge, implying that such
things are ventured on among them as even to speak plainly of was
intolerable for Paul. Wherefore also, as he goes on, he uses the
same mode of speech, saying, “Him who hath so done this
thing:” and is again ashamed and blushes to speak out; which
also we are wont to do in regard of matters extremely
disgraceful. And he said not, “his step-mother,” but, “his
father’s wife;” so as to strike much more severely. For when
the mere terms are sufficient to convey the charge, he proceeds
with them simply, adding nothing.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvi-p7">And “tell me not,” saith he, “that the
fornicator is but one: the charge hath become common to all.”
Wherefore at once he added, “and ye are puffed up:” he said
not, “with the sin;” for this would imply want of all reason: 
but with the doctrine you have heard from that person<note place="end" n="76" id="iv.xvi-p7.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xvi-p8">
S. Aug. <i>cont. Parm</i>. iii. 5. gives their “glorying”
a different turn; saying, (with especial reference to <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 5.6" id="iv.xvi-p8.1" parsed="|1Cor|5|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.5.6">v. 6</scripRef>.) “To glory, not for their
own sins, but over other men’s sins, as in comparison with their
own innocence, may seem but ‘a little leaven;’ while to boast
even of one’s iniquities is much leaven: however, this also
‘leaveneth the whole lump.’” [Perhaps the phrase refers
merely to their general elation at their good estate,
notwithstanding their toleration of so great an offence. C.]</p></note>. This however he set not
<pb n="84" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_84.html" id="iv.xvi-Page_84" />down himself, but left it
undetermined, that he might inflict a heavier blow.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvi-p9">And mark the good sense of Paul. Having first
overthrown the wisdom from without, and signified that it is
nothing by itself although no sin were associated with it; then and
not till then he discourses about the sin also. For if by way of
comparison with the fornicator who perhaps was some wise one, he
had maintained the greatness of his own spiritual gift; he had done
no great thing: but even when unattended with sin to take down
the heathen wisdom and demonstrate it to be nothing, this was
indicating its extreme worthlessness indeed. Wherefore first, as
I said, having made the comparison, he afterwards mentions the
man’s sin also.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvi-p10">And with him indeed he condescends not to debate,
and thereby signifies the exceeding greatness of his dishonor.
But to the others he saith, “You ought to weep and wail, and
cover your faces, but now ye do the contrary.” And this is the
force of the next clause, “And ye are puffed up, and did not
rather mourn.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvi-p11">“And why are we to weep?” some might say.
Because the reproach hath made its way even unto the whole body of
your Church. “And what good are we to get by our weeping?”
“That such an one should be taken away from you.” Not even
here doth he mention his name; rather, I should say, not any where;
which in all monstrous things is our usual way.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvi-p12">And he said not, “Ye have not rather cast him
out,” but, as in the case of any disease or pestilence, “there
is need of mourning,” saith he, “and of intense supplication,
‘that he may be taken away.’ And you should have used prayer
for this, and left nothing undone that he should be cut off.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvi-p13">Nor yet doth he accuse them for not having given him
information, but for not having mourned so that the man should be
taken away; implying that even without their Teacher this ought to
have been done, because of the notoriety of the offence.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvi-p14">[3.] <scripRef passage="1 Cor. v.3" id="iv.xvi-p14.1" parsed="|1Cor|5|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.5.3">Ver. 3</scripRef>. “For I verily being absent
in body, but present in spirit.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvi-p15">Mark his energy. He suffers them not even to wait
for his presence, nor to receive him first and then pass the
sentence of binding: but as if on the point of expelling some
contagion before that it have spread itself into the rest of the
body, he hastens to restrain it. And therefore he subjoins the
clause, “I have judged already, as though I were present.”
These things moreover he said, not only to urge them unto the
declaration of their sentence and to give them no opportunity of
contriving something else, but also to frighten them, as one who
knew what was to be done and determined there. For this is the
meaning of being “present in spirit:” as Elisha was present
with Gehazi, and said, “Went not my heart with thee? (<scripRef passage="2 Kings v. 26" id="iv.xvi-p15.1" parsed="|2Kgs|5|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Kgs.5.26">2 Kings v. 26</scripRef>.) Wonderful!  How great is
the power of the gift, in that it makes all to be together and as
one; and qualifies them to know the things which are far off.
“I have judged already as though I were present.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvi-p16">He permits them not to have any other device.
“Now I have uttered my decision as if I were present: let there
be no delays and puttings off: for nothing else must be
done.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvi-p17">Then lest he should be thought too authoritative and
his speech sound rather self-willed, mark how he makes them also
partners in the sentence. For having said, “I have judged,”
he adds, “concerning him that hath so wrought this thing, in the
Name of our Lord Jesus Christ, ye being gathered together, and my
spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, to deliver such an
one unto Satan.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvi-p18">Now what means, “In the Name of our Lord Jesus
Christ?” “According to God;” “not possessed with any
human prejudice.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvi-p19">Some, however, read thus, “Him that hath so
wrought this thing in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,” and
putting a stop there or a break, then subjoin what follows, saying,
“When you are gathered together and my spirit to deliver such an
one unto Satan:” and they assert that the sense of this reading
is as follows, “Him that hath done this thing in the Name of
Christ,” saith St. Paul, “deliver ye unto Satan;” that is,
“him that hath done insult unto the Name of Christ, him that,
after he had become a believer and was called after that
appellation, hath dared to do such things, deliver ye unto
Satan.” But to me the former exposition (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xvi-p19.1">ἐκδοσις</span>.
It seems to mean “enunciation.”) appears the truer.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvi-p20">What then is this? “When ye are gathered
together in the Name of the Lord.” That is; His Name, in whose
behalf ye have met, collecting you together.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvi-p21">“And my spirit.” Again he sets himself at
their head in order that when they should pass sentence, they might
no otherwise cut off the offender than as if he were present; and
that no one might dare to judge him pardonable, knowing that Paul
would be aware of the proceedings.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvi-p22">[4.] Then making it yet more awful, he saith,
“with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ;” that is, either that
Christ is able to give you such grace as that you should have power
to deliver him to the devil; or that He is 
<pb n="85" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_85.html" id="iv.xvi-Page_85" />Himself together with you passing that sentence
against him.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvi-p23">And he said not, “Give up” such an one to Satan,
but “deliver;” opening unto him the doors of repentance, and
delivering up such an one as it were to a schoolmaster. And again
it is, “such an one:” he no where can endure to make mention
of his name.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvi-p24">“For the destruction of the flesh.” As was
done in the case of the blessed Job, but not upon the same
ground. For in that case it was for brighter crowns, but here for
loosing of sins; that he might scourge him with a grievous sore or
some other disease. True it is that elsewhere he saith, “Of the
Lord are we judged, (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. xi. 32" id="iv.xvi-p24.1" parsed="|1Cor|11|32|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.11.32">1
Cor. xi. 32</scripRef>.) when we
suffer these things.” But here, desirous of making them feel it
more severely, he “delivereth up unto Satan.” And so this too
which God had determined ensued, that the man’s flesh was
chastised. For because inordinate eating and carnal luxuriousness
are the parents of desires, it is the flesh which he chastises.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvi-p25">“That the spirit may be saved in the day of the
Lord Jesus;” that is the soul. Not as though this were saved
alone, but because it was a settled point that if that were saved,
without all controversy the body too would partake in its
salvation. For as it became mortal because of the soul’s
sinning: so if this do righteousness, that also on the other hand
shall enjoy great glory.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvi-p26">But some maintain, that “the Spirit” is the
Gracious Gift which is extinguished when we sin. “In order then
that this may not happen,” saith he, “let him be punished; that
thereby becoming better, he may draw down to himself God’s grace,
and be found having it safe in that day.” So that all comes as
from one exercising a nurse’s or a physician’s office, not
merely scourging nor punishing rashly and at random. For the gain
is greater than the punishment: one being but for a season, the
other everlasting.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvi-p27">And he said not simply, “That the spirit may be
saved,” but “in that day.” Well and seasonably doth he
remind them of that day in order that both they might more readily
apply themselves to the cure, and that the person censured might
the rather receive his words, not as it were of anger, but as the
forethought of an anxious father. For this cause also he said,
“unto the destruction of the flesh:” proceeding to lay down
regulations for the devil and not suffering him to go a step too
far. As in the instance of Job, God said, (<scripRef passage="Job ii. 6" id="iv.xvi-p27.1" parsed="|Job|2|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Job.2.6">Job ii. 6</scripRef>.) “But touch not his
life.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvi-p28">[5.] Then, having ended his sentence, and spoken
it in brief without dwelling on it, he brings in again a rebuke,
directing himself against them;</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvi-p29"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 5.6" id="iv.xvi-p29.1" parsed="|1Cor|5|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.5.6">Ver. 6</scripRef>.
“Your glorying is not good:” signifying that it was they up
to the present time who had hindered him from repenting, by taking
pride in him. Next he shews that he is taking this step in order
to spare not that person only, but also those to whom he writes.
To which effect he adds,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvi-p30">“Know ye not, that a little leaven leaveneth the
whole lump?” “For,” saith he, “though the offence be his,
yet if neglected it hath power to waste the rest of the body of the
Church also. For when the first transgressor escapes punishment,
speedily will others also commit the same faults.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvi-p31"> In these words he indicates moreover that their
struggle and their danger is for the whole Church, not for any one
person. For which purpose he needeth also the similitude of the
leaven. For “as that,” saith he, “though it be but little,
transforms unto its own nature the whole lump; so also this man, if
he be let go unpunished and this sin turn out unavenged, will
corrupt likewise all the rest.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvi-p32"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 5.7" id="iv.xvi-p32.1" parsed="|1Cor|5|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.5.7">Ver. 7</scripRef>.
“Purge out the old leaven,” that is, this evil one. Not that
he speaketh concerning this one only; rather he glances at others
with him. For, “the old leaven” is not fornication only, but
also sin of every kind. And he said not, “purge,” but
“purge out;” “cleanse with accuracy so that there be not so
much as a remnant nor a shadow of that sort.” In saying then,
“purge out,” he signifies that there was still iniquity among
them. But in saying, “that ye may be a new lump, even as ye are
unleavened,” he affirms and declares that not over very many was
the wickedness prevailing. But though he saith, “as ye are
unleavened,” he means it not as a fact that all were clean, but
as to what sort of people you ought to be.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvi-p33">[6.] “For our Passover also hath been sacrificed
for us, even Christ; wherefore let us keep the feast: not with
old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with
the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.” So also Christ
called His doctrine Leaven. And further he himself dwells upon
the metaphor, reminding them of an ancient history, and of the
Passover and unleavened bread, and of their blessings both then and
now, and their punishments and their plagues.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvi-p34"> It is festival, therefore, the whole time in which
we live. For though he said, “Let us keep the feast,” not
with a view to the presence of the Passover or of Pentecost did he
say it; but as pointing out that the whole of time is a festival
unto Christians, because of the excellency of the good things which
have been given. For what hath not come to pass that is good? 
The Son of God was made man for thee; He freed thee from death; and
called thee to a kingdom. Thou therefore who hast obtained and
art still obtaining such things, how can it 
<pb n="86" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_86.html" id="iv.xvi-Page_86" />be less than thy duty to “keep the feast” all
thy life? Let no one then be downcast about poverty, and disease,
and craft of enemies. For it is a festival, even the whole of our
time. Wherefore saith Paul, (<scripRef passage="Philip. iv. 4" id="iv.xvi-p34.1" parsed="|Phil|4|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Phil.4.4">Philip. iv. 4</scripRef>.) “Rejoice in the Lord
always; again I say, Rejoice.” Upon the festival days no one
puts on filthy garments. Neither then let us do so. For a
marriage hath been made, a spiritual marriage. For, “the
kingdom of Heaven,” saith He, “is likened unto a certain king
which would make (St. 
<scripRef passage="Matt. xxii. 1" id="iv.xvi-p34.2" parsed="|Matt|22|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.22.1">Matt. xxii. 1</scripRef>. <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xvi-p34.3"> ἠθέλησε ποιῆσαι</span>, rec. text <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xvi-p34.4"> ἐποίησε</span>.) a marriage
feast for his son.” Now where it is a king making a marriage,
and a marriage for his son, what can be greater than this feast? 
Let no one then enter in clad in rags. Not about garments is our
discourse but about unclean actions. For if where all wore bright
apparel one alone, being found at the marriage in filthy garments,
was cast out with dishonor, consider how great strictness and
purity the entrance into that marriage feast requires.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvi-p35">[7.] However, not on this account only does he
remind them of the “unleavened bread,” but also to point out
the affinity of the Old Testament with the New; and to point out
also that it was impossible, after the “unleavened bread,”
again to enter into Egypt; but if any one chose to return, he would
suffer the same things as did they. For those things were a
shadow of these; however obstinate the Jew may be. Wherefore
shouldest thou enquire of him, he will speak, no great thing,
rather it is great which he will speak of, but nothing like what we
speak of: because he knows not the truth. For he for his part
will say, “the Egyptians who detained us were so changed by the
Almighty that they themselves urged and drave us out, who before
held us forcibly; they did not suffer us so much as to leaven our
dough.” But if a man asketh me, he shall hear not of Egypt nor
of Pharaoh; but of our deliverance from the deceit of demons and
the darkness of the devil: not of Moses but of the Son of God;
not of a Red Sea but of a Baptism overflowing with ten thousand
blessings, where the “old man” is drowned.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvi-p36">Again, shouldest thou ask the Jew why he expels all
leaven from all his borders; here he will even be silent and will
not so much as state any reason. And this is because, although
some indeed of the circumstances were both types of things to come,
and also due to things then happening; yet others were not so, that
the Jews might not deal deceitfully; that they might not abide in
the shadow. For tell me, what is the meaning of the Lamb’s
being a “Male,” and “Unblemished,” and a “year old,”
and of, “a bone shall not be broken?” and what means the
command to call the neighbors also, (<scripRef passage="Exod. xii. 4" id="iv.xvi-p36.1" parsed="|Exod|12|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Exod.12.4">Exod. xii. 4</scripRef>.) and that it should be eaten
“standing” and “in the evening;” or the fortifying the
house with blood? He will have nothing else to say but over and
over all about Egypt. But I can tell you the meaning both of the
Blood, and of the Evening, and the Eating all together, and of the
rule that all should be standing.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvi-p37">[8.] But first let us explain why the leaven
is cast out of all their borders. What then is the hidden
meaning? The believer must be freed from all iniquity. For as
among them he perishes with whomsoever is found old leaven, so also
with us wheresoever is found iniquity: since of course the
punishment being so great in that which is a shadow, in our case it
cannot choose but be much greater. For if they so carefully clear
their houses of leaven<note place="end" n="77" id="iv.xvi-p37.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xvi-p38">
Lightfoot, <i>Works</i>, i. 953. “‘<i>Seven days there
shall be no leaven found in your houses</i>.’ The Jews to meet
this command that was so exceeding strict, and to make sure for its
observance soon enough, ‘did on the fourteenth day, while yet
there was some light, make search for leaven by the light of a
candle.’  (<i>Talm. in Pesachim</i>. no. 1.) Thus is the
Tradition; in which by the light of the fourteenth day their
glossaries tell us that we must understand the ‘thirteenth day at
even, when it began to be duskish and candle-light.’ The rubric
of the Passover in the Hebrew and Spanish tongues renders it, ‘At
the entrance of the fourteenth day of the month Nisan, they
searched for leaven in all the places where they were wont to use
leaven, even in holes and crannies; and that not by light of the
sun and moon, or torch, but by the light of a wax
candle,’…because it is the fittest for searching holes and
corners, and because the Scripture speaketh of searching Jerusalem
with candles.” See 
<scripRef passage="Zeph. i. 12" id="iv.xvi-p38.1" parsed="|Zeph|1|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Zeph.1.12">Zeph. i. 12</scripRef>.</p></note>, and pry into mouse-holes; much more
ought we to search through the soul so as to cast out every unclean
thought.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvi-p39">This however was done by them of late<note place="end" n="78" id="iv.xvi-p39.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xvi-p40">
i.e. (as it should seem) it has now become impossible for the Jews
to keep this command, since they and their false doctrine are
(spiritually) that very leaven, which is to be put away. Compare
St. <scripRef passage="Matt. xvi. 6" id="iv.xvi-p40.1" parsed="|Matt|16|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.16.6">Matt. xvi. 6</scripRef>.</p></note>; but now no longer. For every
where there is leaven, where a Jew is found. For it is in the
midst of cities that the feast of unleavened bread is kept: a
thing which is now rather a game at play than a law. For since
the Truth is come, the Types have no longer any place.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvi-p41">So that by means of this example also he mightily
drives the fornicator out of the Church. For, saith he, so far
from his presence profiting, he even doth harm, injuring the common
estate of the body. For one knows not whence is the evil savor
while the corrupt part is concealed, and so one imputes it to the
whole. Wherefore he urges upon them strongly to “purge out the
leaven, that ye may be,” saith he, “a new lump, even as ye are
unleavened.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvi-p42">“For our Passover hath been sacrificed for us even
Christ.” He said not, hath died, but more in point to the
subject in hand, “hath been sacrificed.” Seek not then
unleavened bread of this kind, since neither hast thou a lamb of
the same kind. Seek not leaven of this description, seeing that
thine unleavened bread is not such as this.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvi-p43">[9.] Thus, in the case of material leaven, <pb n="87" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_87.html" id="iv.xvi-Page_87" />the unleavened might become leavened,
but never the reverse; whereas here there is a chance of the direct
contrary occuring. This however he has not plainly declared: 
and observe his good sense. In the former Epistle he gives the
fornicator no hope of return, but orders that his whole life should
be spent in repentance, lest he should make him less energetic
through the promise. For he said not, “Deliver him up to
Satan,” that having repented he might be commended again unto the
Church. But what saith he? “That he may be saved in the last
day.” For he conducts him on unto that time in order to make
him full of anxiety. And what favors he intended him after the
repentance, he reveals not, imitating his own Master. For as God
saith, (<scripRef passage="Jonah iii. 4" id="iv.xvi-p43.1" parsed="|Jonah|3|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Jonah.3.4">Jonah iii. 4</scripRef>. lxx: rec. text, “forty
days.”) “Yet three days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown,”
and added not, “but if she repent she shall be saved:” so
also he did not say here, “But if he repent worthily, we will
‘confirm our love towards him.’” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. ii. 8" id="iv.xvi-p43.2" parsed="|2Cor|2|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.2.8">2 Cor. ii. 8</scripRef>.). But he waits for him to
do the work that so he may then receive the favor. For if he had
said this at the beginning he might have set him free from the
fear. Wherefore he not only does not so, but by the instance of
leaven allows him not even a hope of return, but reserves him unto
that day: “Purge out (so he says) the old leaven;” and,
“let us not keep the feast with old leaven.” But as soon as
he had repented, he brought him in again with all earnestness.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvi-p44">[10.] But why does he call it “old?” Either
because our former life was of this sort, or because that which is
old is “ready to vanish away,” (<scripRef passage="Heb. viii. 13" id="iv.xvi-p44.1" parsed="|Heb|8|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Heb.8.13">Heb. viii. 13</scripRef>.) and is unsavory and foul;
which is the nature of sin. For He neither simply finds fault
with the old, nor simply praises the new, but with reference to the
subject matter. And thus elsewhere He saith, (<scripRef passage="Ecclesiasticus 9.15" id="iv.xvi-p44.2" parsed="|Sir|9|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Sir.9.15">Ecclus. ix. 15</scripRef>.) “New wine is as a new
friend: but if it become old, then with pleasure shalt thou drink
it:” in the case of friendship bestowing his praise rather upon
the old than the new. And again, “The Ancient of days sat,”
(<scripRef passage="Dan. vii. 9" id="iv.xvi-p44.3" parsed="|Dan|7|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Dan.7.9">Dan. vii. 9</scripRef>.) here again, taking the term
“ancient” as among those laudatory expressions which confer
highest glory. Elsewhere the Scripture takes the term “old”
in the sense of blame; for seeing that the things are of various
aspect as being composed of many parts, it uses the same words both
in a good and an evil import, not according to the same shade of
meaning. Of which you may see an instance in the blame cast
elsewhere on the old: (<scripRef passage="Ps. xvii. 46" id="iv.xvi-p44.4" parsed="|Ps|17|46|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.17.46">Ps. xvii. 46</scripRef>. ap. LXX.) “They waxed old,
and they halted from their paths.” And again, (<scripRef passage="Ps. vi. 7" id="iv.xvi-p44.5" parsed="|Ps|6|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.6.7">Ps. vi. 7</scripRef>. ap. LXX.) “I have become
old in the midst of all mine enemies.” And again, (<scripRef passage="History of Susanna 52" id="iv.xvi-p44.6">Dan. xiii. 52. Hist. Susan</scripRef>.) “O thou that art become
old in evil days.” So also the “Leaven” is often taken for
the kingdom of Heaven, although here found fault with. But in
that place it is used with one aspect, and in this with
another.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvi-p45">[11.] But I have a strong conviction that the
saying about the leaven refers also to the priests who suffer a
vast deal of the old leaven to be within, not purging out from
their borders, that is, out of the Church, the covetous, the
extortioners, and whatsoever would exclude from the kingdom of
Heaven. For surely covetousness is an “old leaven;” and
whenever it lights and into whatsoever house it enters, makes it
unclean: and though you may gain but little by your injustice, it
leavens the whole of your substance. Wherefore not seldom the
dishonest gain being little, hath cast out the stock honestly laid
up however abundant. For nothing is more rotten than
covetousness. You may fasten up that man’s closet with key, and
door, and bolt: you do all in vain, whilst you shut up within
covetousness, the worst of robbers, and able to carry off all.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvi-p46">“But what,” say you, “if there are many
covetous who do not experience this?” In the first place, they
will experience it, though their experience come not immediately.
And should they now escape, then do thou fear it the more: for
they are reserved for greater punishment. Add to this, that in
the event of themselves escaping, yet those who inherit their
wealth will have the same to endure. “But how can this be
just,” you will say? It is quite just. For he that has
succeeded to an inheritance; full of injustice, though he have
committed no rapine himself, detains nevertheless the property of
others; and is perfectly aware of this; and it is fair he should
suffer for it. For if this or that person had robbed and you
received a thing, and then the owner came and demanded it back;
would it avail you in defence to say that you had not seized it? 
By no means. For what would be your plea when accused! tell me.
That it was another who seized it? Well: but you are keeping
possession. That it was he who robbed? But you are enjoying
it. Why these rules even the laws of the heathen recognise, which
acquitting those who have seized and stolen, bid you demand
satisfaction from those persons in whose possession you happen to
find your things all laid up.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvi-p47">If then you know who are the injured, restore and do
what Zacchæus did, with much increase. But if you know not, I
offer you another way yet; I do not preclude you from the remedy.
Distribute all these things to the poor: and thus you will
mitigate the evil.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvi-p48">But if some have transmitted these things even to
children and descendants, still in retribution they have suffered
other disasters.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvi-p49"><pb n="88" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_88.html" id="iv.xvi-Page_88" />[12.] And why
speak I of things in this present life? In that day at any rate
will none of these things be said, when both appear naked, both the
spoiled and the spoilers. Or rather not alike naked. Of riches
indeed both will be equally stripped; but the one will be full of
the charges to which they gave occasion. What then shall we do on
that day, when before the dread tribunal he that hath been evil
entreated and lost his all is brought forward into the midst, and
you have no one to speak a word for you? What will you say to the
Judge? Now indeed you may be able even to corrupt the judgment,
being but of men; but in that court and at that time, it will be no
longer so: no, nor yet now will you be able. For even at this
moment that tribunal is present: since God both seeth our doings
and is near unto the injured, though not invoked: it being
certain that whoever suffers wrong, however in himself unworthy to
obtain any redress, yet nevertheless seeing that what is done
pleases not God, he hath most assuredly one to avenge him.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvi-p50">“How then,” you will say, “is such an one well
off, who is wicked?” Nay, it will not be so unto the end.
Hear what saith the Prophet; (<scripRef passage="Ps. xxxvii. 1, 2" id="iv.xvi-p50.1" parsed="|Ps|37|1|37|2" osisRef="Bible:Ps.37.1-Ps.37.2">Ps. xxxvii. 1, 2</scripRef>.) “Fret not thyself because
of the evil doers, because as grass they shall quickly wither
away.” For where, tell me, where is he who wrought rapine,
after his departure hence? Where are his bright hopes!  Where
his august name? Are they not all passed and gone? Is it not a
dream and a shadow, all that was his? And this you must expect in
the case of every such person, both in his own person while living,
and in that of him who shall come after him. But not such is the
state of the saints, nor will it be possible for you to say the
same things in their case also, that it is shadow and a dream and a
tale, what belongs to them.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvi-p51">[13.] And if you please, he who spake these
things, the tent-maker, the Cilician, the man whose very parentage
is unknown, let him be the example we produce. You will say,
“How is it possible to become such as he was?” Do you then
thoroughly desire it? Are you thoroughly anxious to become
such? “Yes,” you will say. Well then, go the same way as he
went and they that were with him. Now what way went he? One
saith, (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. xi. 27" id="iv.xvi-p51.1" parsed="|2Cor|11|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.11.27">2 Cor. xi. 27</scripRef>.) “In hunger, and thirst,
and nakedness.” Another, (<scripRef passage="Acts iii. 6" id="iv.xvi-p51.2" parsed="|Acts|3|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.3.6">Acts iii. 6</scripRef>.) “Silver and gold I have
none.” Thus they “had nothing and yet possessed all
things.” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. vi. 10" id="iv.xvi-p51.3" parsed="|2Cor|6|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.6.10">2 Cor. vi.
10</scripRef>.) What can be nobler
than this saying? what more blessed or more abundant in riches? 
Others indeed pride themselves on the contrary things, saying, “I
have this or that number of talents of gold, and acres of land
without end, and houses, and slaves;” but this man on his being
naked of all things; and he shrinks not from poverty, (which is the
feeling of the unwise,) nor hides his face, but he even wears it as
an ornament.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvi-p52">Where now be the rich men, they who count up their
interest simple and compound, they who take from all men and are
never satisfied? Have ye heard the voice of Peter, that voice
which sets forth poverty as the mother of wealth? That voice
which has nothing, yet is wealthier than those who wear diadems? 
For this is that voice, which having nothing, raised the dead, and
set upright the lame, and drove away devils, and bestowed such
gracious gifts, as those who are clad in the purple robe and lead
the mighty and terrible legions never were able to bestow. This
is the voice of those who are now removed into heaven, of those who
have attained unto that height.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvi-p53">[14.] Thus it is possible that he who hath nothing
may possess all men’s goods. Thus may he who possesses nothing
acquire the goods of all: whereas, were we to get all men’s
goods, we are bereft of all. Perhaps this saying seems to be a
paradox; but it is not. “But,” you will say, “how does he
who hath nothing possess all men’s goods? Doth he not have much
more who hath what belongs to all?” By no means: but the
contrary. For he who hath nothing commands all, even as they
did. And throughout the world all houses were open to them, and
they who offered them took their coming as a favor, and they came
to them as to friends and kindred.  For so they came to the woman
who was a seller of purple, (<scripRef passage="Acts xvi. 14" id="iv.xvi-p53.1" parsed="|Acts|16|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.16.14">Acts xvi. 14</scripRef>.) and she like a servant set
before them what she had. And to the keeper of the prison; and he
opened to them all his house. And to innumerable others. Thus
they had all things and had nothing: for (<scripRef passage="Acts iv. 32" id="iv.xvi-p53.2" parsed="|Acts|4|32|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.4.32">Acts iv. 32</scripRef>.) “they said that none of
the things which they possessed was their own;” therefore all
things were theirs. For he that considers all things to be
common, will not only use his own, but also the things of others as
if they belonged to him. But he that parts things off and sets
himself as master over his own only, will not be master even of
these. And this is plain from an example. He who possesses
nothing at all, neither house, nor table, nor garment to spare, but
for God’s sake is bereft of all, uses the things which are in
common as his own; and he shall receive from all whatsoever he may
desire, and thus he that hath nothing possesses the things of
all. But he that hath some things, will not be master even of
these. For first, no one will give to him that hath possessions;
and, secondly, his property shall belong to robbers and thieves and
informers and changing events and be any body’s rather than
his. Paul, for instance, went up and down throughout all the
world, <pb n="89" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_89.html" id="iv.xvi-Page_89" />carrying nothing with
him, though he went neither unto friends nor kindred. Nay, at
first he was a common enemy to all: but nevertheless he had all
men’s goods after he had made good his entrance. But Ananias
and Sapphira, hastening to gain a little more than their own, lost
all together with life itself. Withdraw then from thine own, that
thou mayest use others’ goods as thine own.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvi-p54">[15.] But I must stop: I know not how I have
been carried into such a transport in speaking such words as these
unto men who think it a great thing to impart but ever so little of
their own. Wherefore let these my words have been spoken to the
perfect. But to the more imperfect, this is what we may say, Give
of what you have unto the needy. Increase your substance. For,
saith He, (<scripRef passage="Prov. xix. 17" id="iv.xvi-p54.1" parsed="|Prov|19|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Prov.19.17">Prov. xix.
17</scripRef>.) “He that giveth
unto the poor, lendeth unto God.” But if you are in a hurry and
wait not for the time of recompense, think of those who lend money
to men: for not even these desire to get their interest
immediately; but they are anxious that the principal should remain
a good long while in the hands of the borrower, provided only the
repayment be secure and they have no mistrust of the borrower.
Let this be done then in the present case also. Leave them with
God that He may pay thee thy wages manifold. Seek not to have the
whole here; for if you recover it all here, how will you receive it
back there? And it is on this account that God stores them up
there, inasmuch as this present life is full of decay. But He
gives even here also; for, “Seek ye,” saith He, “the kingdom
of heaven, and all these things shall be added unto you.” (St.
<scripRef passage="Matt. vi. 33" id="iv.xvi-p54.2" parsed="|Matt|6|33|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.6.33">Matt. vi. 33</scripRef>.) Well then, let us look
towards the kingdom, and not be in a hurry for the repayment of the
whole, lest we diminish our recompense. But let us wait for the
fit season. For the interest in these cases is not of that kind,
but is such as is meet to be given to God. This then having
collected together in great abundance, so let us depart hence, that
we may obtain both the present and the future blessings; through
the grace and loving-kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, with Whom
unto the Father and the Holy Spirit be glory, power, honor, now,
henceforth, and for evermore. Amen.</p>

<p class="c24" id="iv.xvii-p4"><span class="c18" id="iv.xvii-p4.1">For</span> since he had said,
“Ye have not rather mourned, that such an one should be taken
away;” and, “Purge out the old leaven;” and it was likely
that they would surmise it to be their duty to avoid all
fornicators: for if he that has sinned imparts some of his own
mischief to those who have not sinned, much more is it meet to keep
one’s self away from those without: (for if one ought not to
spare a friend on account of such mischief arising from him, much
less any others;) and under this impression, it was probable that
they would separate themselves from the fornicators among the
Greeks also, and the matter thus turning out impossible, they would
have taken it more to heart: he used this mode of correction,
saying, “I wrote unto you to have no company with fornicators,
yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world:” using
the word “altogether,” as if it were an acknowledged thing.
For that they might not think that he charged not this upon them as
being rather imperfect, and should attempt to do it under the
erroneous impression that they were perfect, he shews that this
were even impossible to be done, though they wished it ever so
much. For it would be necessary to seek another world.
Wherefore he added, “For ye must needs then go out of the
world.” Seest thou that he is no hard master, and that in his
legislation he constantly regards not only what may be done, but
also what may be easily done. For how is it possible, says he,
for a man having care of a house and children, and engaged in the
affairs of the city, or who is an artisan or a soldier, (the
greater part of mankind being Greeks,) to avoid the unclean who are
to be found every where? For by “the fornicators of the
world,” he means those who are among the Greeks. “But now I
write unto you, If any brother” be of this kind, “with such an
one no not to eat.” Here also he glances at others who were
living in wickedness.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvii-p5"><pb n="90" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_90.html" id="iv.xvii-Page_90" />But how can one
“that is a brother” be an idolater? As was the case once in
regard to the Samaritans who chose piety but by halves. And
besides he is laying down his ground beforehand for the discourse
concerning things offered in sacrifice to idols, which after this
he intends to handle.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvii-p6">“Or covetous.” For with these also he enters
into conflict. Wherefore he said also, “Why not rather take
wrong? Why not rather be defrauded? Nay, ye yourselves do wrong
and defraud.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvii-p7">“Or a drunkard.” For this also he lays to
their charge further on; as when he says, “One is hungry and
another is drunken:” and, “meats for the belly and the belly
for meats.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvii-p8">“Or a reviler, or an extortioner:” for these
too he had rebuked before.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvii-p9">[2.] Next he adds also the reason why he forbids
them not to mix with heathens of that character, implying that it
is not only impossible, but also superfluous.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvii-p10"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 5.12" id="iv.xvii-p10.1" parsed="|1Cor|5|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.5.12">Ver. 12</scripRef>,
“For what have I to do with judging them that are without?”
Calling the Christians and the Greeks, “those within” and
“those without,” as also he says elsewhere, (<scripRef passage="1 Tim. iii. 7" id="iv.xvii-p10.2" parsed="|1Tim|3|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.3.7">1 Tim. iii. 7</scripRef>.) “He must also have a good
report of them that are without.” And in the Epistle to the
Thessalonians he speaks the same language, saying, (<scripRef passage="2 Thess. iii. 14" id="iv.xvii-p10.3" parsed="|2Thess|3|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Thess.3.14">2 Thess. iii. 14</scripRef>.) “Have no intercourse with
him to the end that he may be put to shame.” And, “Count him
not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.” Here, however,
he does not add the reason. Why? Because in the other case he
wished to soothe them, but in this, not so. For the fault in this
case and in that was not the same, but in the Thessalonians it was
less. For there he is reproving indolence; but here fornication
and other most grievous sins. And if any one wished to go over to
the Greeks, he hinders not him from eating with such persons; this
too for the same reason. So also do we act; for our children and
our brethren we leave nothing undone, but of strangers we do not
make much account. How then? Did not Paul care for them that
were without as well? Yes, he cared for them; but it was not till
after they received the Gospel and he had made them subject to the
doctrine of Christ, that he laid down laws for them. But so long
as they despised, it was superfluous to speak the precepts of
Christ to those who knew not Christ Himself.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvii-p11">“Do not ye judge them that are within, whereas
them that are without, God judgeth?” For since he had said,
“What have I to do with judging those without;” lest any one
should think that these were left unpunished, there is another
tribunal which he sets over them, and that a fearful one. And
this he said, both to terrify those, and to console these;
intimating also that this punishment which is for a season snatches
them away from that which is undying and perpetual: which also he
has plainly declared elsewhere, saying, (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. xi. 32" id="iv.xvii-p11.1" parsed="|1Cor|11|32|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.11.32">1 Cor. xi. 32</scripRef>.) “But now being judged, we
are chastened, that we should not be condemned with the
world.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvii-p12">[3.] “Put away from among yourselves the wicked
person.” He used an expression found in the Old Testament,
(<scripRef passage="Deut. xvii. 7" id="iv.xvii-p12.1" parsed="|Deut|17|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Deut.17.7">Deut. xvii. 7</scripRef>.) partly hinting that they too
will be very great gainers, in being freed as it were from some
grievous plague; and partly to shew that this kind of thing is no
innovation, but even from the beginning it seemed good to the
legislator that such as these should be cut off. But in that
instance it was done with more severity, in this with more
gentleness. On which account one might reasonably question, why
in that case he conceded that the sinner should be severely
punished and stoned, but in the present instance not so; rather he
leads him to repentance. Why then were the lines drawn in the
former instance one way and in the latter another? For these two
causes: one, because these were led into a greater trial and
needed greater long-suffering; the other and truer one, because
these by their impunity were more easily to be corrected, coming as
they might to repentance; but the others were likely to go on to
greater wickedness. For if when they saw the first undergoing
punishment they persisted in the same things, had none at all been
punished, much more would this have been their feeling. For which
reason in that dispensation death is immediately inflicted upon the
adulterer and the manslayer; but in this, if through repentance
they are absolved, they have escaped the punishment. However,
both here one may see some instances of heavier punishment, and in
the Old Testament some less severe, in order that it may be
signified in every way that the covenants are akin to each other,
and of one and the same lawgiver: and you may see the punishment
following immediately both in that covenant and in this, and in
both often after a long interval. Nay, and oftentimes not even
after a long interval, repentance alone being taken as satisfaction
by the Almighty. Thus in the Old Testament, David, who had
committed adultery and murder, was saved by means of repentance;
and in the New, Ananias, who withdrew but a small portion of the
price of the land, perished together with his wife. Now if these
instances are more frequent in the Old Testament, and those of the
contrary kind in the New, the difference of the persons produces
the difference in the treatment adopted in such matters.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvii-p13">[4.] C. <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 6.1" id="iv.xvii-p13.1" parsed="|1Cor|6|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.6.1">vi. ver. 1</scripRef>. “Dare any one of you,
having a matter against his brother, (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xvii-p13.2">τὸν ἀδελφὸν</span>, rec. text <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xvii-p13.3"> τὁν ἓτερον</span>.) go to law before the unrighteous, and
not before the saints?”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvii-p14"><pb n="91" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_91.html" id="iv.xvii-Page_91" />Here also he
again makes his complaint upon acknowledged grounds; for in that
other place he says, “It is actually reported that there is
fornication among you.” And in this place, “Dare any one of
you?” From the very first outset giving signs of his anger, and
implying that the thing spoken of comes of a daring and lawless
spirit.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvii-p15">Now wherefore did he bring in by the way that
discourse about covetousness and about the duty of not going to law
without the Church? In fulfilment of his own rule. For it is a
custom with him to set to right things as they fall in his way;
just as when speaking about the tables which they used in common,
he launched out into the discourse about the mysteries. So here,
you see, since he had made mention of covetous brethren, burning
with anxiety to correct those in sin, he brooks not exactly to
observe order; but he again corrects the sin which had been
introduced out of the regular course, and so returns to the former
subject.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvii-p16">Let us hear then what he also says about this.
“Dare any of you, having a matter, go to law before the
unrighteous, and not before the saints?” For a while, he
employs those personal terms to expose, discredit, and blame their
proceedings: nor does he quite from the beginning subvert the
custom of seeking judgment before the believers: but when he had
stricken them down by many words, then he even takes away entirely
all going to law. “For in the first place,” says he, “if
one must go to law it were wrong to do so before the unrighteous.
But you ought not to go to law at all.” This however he adds
afterwards. For the present he thoroughly sifts the former
subject, namely, that they should not submit matters to external
arbitration. “For,” says he, “how can it be otherwise than
absurd that one who is at variance (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xvii-p16.1">μικροψυχοῦτα</span>) with his friend should take his
enemy to be a reconciler between them? And how can you avoid
feeling shame and blushing when a Greek sits to judge a
Christian? And if about private matters it is not right to go to
law before Greeks, how shall we submit to their decisions about
other things of greater importance?”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvii-p17">Observe, moreover, how he speaks. He says not,
“Before the unbelievers,” but, “Before the unrighteous;”
using the expression of which he had most particular need for the
matter before him, in order to deter and keep them away. For see
that his discourse was about going to law, and those who are
engaged in suits seek for nothing so much as that the judges should
feel great interest about what is just; he takes this as a ground
of dissuasion, all but saying, “Where are you going? What are
you doing, O man, bringing on yourself the contrary to what you
wish, and in order to obtain justice committing yourself to unjust
men?” And because it would have been intolerable to be told at
once not to go to law, he did not immediately add this, but only
changed the judges, bringing the party engaged in the trial from
without into the Church.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvii-p18">[5.] Then, since it seemed easily open to
contempt, I mean our being judged by those who were within, and
especially at that time, (for they were not perhaps competent to
comprehend a point, nor were they such as the heathen judges, well
skilled in laws and rhetoric, inasmuch as the greater part of them
were uneducated men,) mark how he makes them worthy of credit,
first calling them “Saints.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvii-p19">But seeing that this bore witness to purity of life,
and not to accuracy in hearing a case, observe how he orderly
handles this part also, saying thus, “Do ye not know that the
saints shall judge the world?” How then canst thou who art in
thy day to judge them, endure to be judged by them now? They will
not indeed judge, taking their seat in person and demanding
account, yet they shall condemn. This at least he plainly said;
“And if the world is judged in you, are ye unworthy to judge the
smallest matters?” He says not “by you,” but “in
you:” just as when He said, (St. 
<scripRef passage="Matt. xii. 42" id="iv.xvii-p19.1" parsed="|Matt|12|42|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.12.42">Matt. xii. 42</scripRef>.) “The queen of the south
shall rise up and condemn this generation:” and, “The men of
Nineveh shall arise and condemn this generation.” For when
beholding the same sun and sharing all the same things, we shall be
found believers but they unbelievers, they will not be able to take
refuge in ignorance. For we shall accuse them, simply by the
things which we have done. And many such ways of judgment one
will find there.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvii-p20">Then, that no one should think he speaks about other
persons, mark how he generalizes his speech. “And if the world
is judged in you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest
matters?”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvii-p21">The thing is a disgrace to you, he says, and an
unspeakable reproach. For since it was likely that they would be
out of countenance at being judged by those that were within;
“nay,” saith he, “on the contrary, the disgrace is when you
are judged by those without: for those are the very small
controversies, not these.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvii-p22"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 6.3" id="iv.xvii-p22.1" parsed="|1Cor|6|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.6.3">Ver. 3</scripRef>.
“Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more, things
which pertain to this life?”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvii-p23">Some say that here the priests are hinted at, but
away with this. His speech is about demons. For had he been
speaking about corrupt priests, he would have meant them above when
he said, “the world is judged in you:” (for the Scripture is
wont to call evil men also “The world:”)  and he would not
have said the same <pb n="92" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_92.html" id="iv.xvii-Page_92" />thing twice,
nor would he, as if he was saying something of greater consequence,
have put it down afterwards. But he speaks concerning those
angels about whom Christ saith, “Depart ye into the fire which is
prepared for the devil and his angels.” (St. 
<scripRef passage="Matt. xxv. 41" id="iv.xvii-p23.1" parsed="|Matt|25|41|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.25.41">Matt. xxv. 41</scripRef>.) And Paul, “his angels
fashion themselves as ministers of righteousness.” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. xi. 15" id="iv.xvii-p23.2" parsed="|2Cor|11|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.11.15">2 Cor. xi. 15</scripRef>.) For when the very
incorporeal powers shall be found inferior to us who are clothed
with flesh, they shall suffer heavier punishment.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvii-p24">But if some should still contend that he speaks of
priests, “What sort of priests?” let us ask. Those whose walk
in life has been worldly, of course. In what sense then does he
say, “We shall judge angels, much more things that relate to this
life?” He mentions the angels, in contradistinction to
“things relating to this life”: likely enough; for they are
removed from the need of these things, because of the superior
excellence of their nature.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvii-p25">[6.] <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 6.4" id="iv.xvii-p25.1" parsed="|1Cor|6|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.6.4">Ver. 4</scripRef>. “If then ye have to
judge things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are of

[Most of the modern critics and the Rev. Version make this a
question, but Principal Edwards agrees with Chrysostom in

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvii-p27">Wishing to instruct us as forcibly as possible that
they ought not to commit themselves to those without, whatsoever
the matter may be; having raised what seemed to be an objection, he
answers it in the first instance. For what he says is something
like this: Perhaps some one will say, “No one among you is
wise, nor competent to pass sentence; all are contemptible.”
Now what follows? “Even though none be wise,” says he, “I
bid you entrust things to those who are of least weight.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvii-p28"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 6.5" id="iv.xvii-p28.1" parsed="|1Cor|6|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.6.5">Ver. 5</scripRef>.
“But this I say to move you to shame.” These are the words of
one exposing their objection as being an idle pretext: and
therefore he adds, “Is it so that there is not a wise man among
you, no not even one?” Is the scarcity, says he, so great? so
great the want of sensible persons among you? And what he
subjoins strikes even still harder. For having said, “Is it so,
that there is not a wise man among you, not even one?” he adds,
“who shall be able to judge in the case of his brother.” For
when brother goes to law with brother, there is never any need of
understanding and talent in the person who is mediating in the
cause, the feeling and relationship contributing greatly to the
settlement of such a quarrel.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvii-p29">“But brother goeth to law with brother, and that
before unbelievers.” Do you observe with what effect he
disparaged the judges at first by calling them unrighteous; whereas
here, to move shame, he calls them Unbelievers? For surely it is
extremely disgraceful if the priest could not be the author of
reconciliation even among brethren, but recourse must be had to
those without. So that when he said, “those who are of no
account,” his chief meaning was not (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xvii-p29.1">οὐ τοῦτο
εἰπε  προηγουμένως</span> ) that the Church’s outcasts should be
appointed as judges, but to find fault with them. For that it was
proper to make reference to those who were able to decide, he has
shewn by saying, “Is it so, that there is not a wise man among
you, not even one?” And with great impressiveness he stops
their mouths, and says, “Even though there were not a single wise
man, the hearing ought to have been left to you who are unwise
rather than that those without should judge.” For what else can
it be than absurd, that whereas on a quarrel arising in a house we
call in no one from without and feel ashamed if news get abroad
among strangers of what is going on within doors; where the Church
is, the treasure of the unutterable Mysteries, there all things
should be published without?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvii-p30"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 6.6" id="iv.xvii-p30.1" parsed="|1Cor|6|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.6.6">Ver. 6</scripRef>.
“But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before
unbelievers.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvii-p31">The charge is twofold; both that he “goeth to
law,” and “before the unbelievers.” For if even the thing
by itself, To go to law with a brother, be a fault, to do it also
before aliens, what pardon does it admit of?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvii-p32">[7.] <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 6.7" id="iv.xvii-p32.1" parsed="|1Cor|6|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.6.7">Ver. 7</scripRef>. “Nay, already it is
altogether a defect in you, that ye have lawsuits one with
another.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvii-p33">Do you see for what place he reserved this point? 
And how he has cleared the discussion of it in good time? For
“I talk not yet,” saith he, “which injures, or which is
injured.” Thus far, the act itself of going to law brings each
party under his censure, and in that respect one is not at all
better than another. But whether one go to law justly or
unjustly, that is quite another subject. Say not then, “which
did the wrong?” For on this ground I at once condemn thee, even
for the act of going to law.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvii-p34">Now if being unable to bear a wrong-doer be a fault,
what accusation can come up to the actual wrong? “Why not
rather take wrong? Why not rather be defrauded?”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvii-p35"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 6.8" id="iv.xvii-p35.1" parsed="|1Cor|6|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.6.8">Ver. 8</scripRef>.
“Nay, ye yourselves do wrong, and defraud, and that your
brethren.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvii-p36">Again, it is a twofold crime, perhaps even threefold
or fourfold. One, not to know how to bear being wronged.
Another, actually to do wrong. A third, to commit the settlement
of these matters even unto the unjust. And yet a fourth, that it
should be so done to a brother. For men’s offences are not
judged by the same rule, when they are committed against any chance
person, and towards one’s own member. For it must be a greater
degree of recklessness to venture upon that. In the other <pb n="93" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_93.html" id="iv.xvii-Page_93" />case, the nature of the thing is
alone trampled on; but in this, the quality of the person also.</p>

the exhortation with a threat, making his speech more peremptory,
and saying thus, (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. 6.9" id="iv.xvii-p38.2" parsed="|1Cor|6|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.6.9">ver. 9</scripRef>.) “Know ye not that the
unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not
deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor
effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with men, (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. 6.10" id="iv.xvii-p38.3" parsed="|1Cor|6|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.6.10">ver.
10</scripRef>.) nor covetous, nor
thieves, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall
inherit the kingdom of God.” What sayest thou? When
discoursing about covetous persons, have you brought in upon us so
vast a crowd of lawless men? “Yes,” says he, “but in doing
this, I am not confusing my discourse, but going on in regular
order.” For as when discoursing about the unclean he made
mention of all together; so again, on mentioning the covetous he
brings forward all, thus making his rebukes familiar to those who
have such things on their conscience. For the continual mention
of the punishment laid up for others makes the reproof easy to be
received, when it comes into conflict with our own sins. And so
in the present instance he utters his threat, not at all as being
conscious of their doing such things, nor as calling them to
account, a thing which has special force to hold the hearer and
keep him from starting off; namely, the discourse having no respect
unto him, but being spoken indefinitely and so wounding his
conscience secretly.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvii-p39">“Be not deceived.” Here he glances at certain
who maintain (what indeed most men assert now) that God being good
and kind to man, takes not vengeance upon our misdeeds: “Let us
not then be afraid.” For never will he exact justice of any one
for any thing. And it is on account of these that he says, “Be
not deceived.” For it belongs to the extreme of error and
delusion, after depending on good to meet with the contrary; and to
surmise such things about God as even in man no one would think
of. Wherefore saith the Prophet in His person, (<scripRef passage="Psa. 50.21" id="iv.xvii-p39.1" parsed="|Ps|50|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.50.21">Ps. xlix.

thy face thine iniquities.” And Paul here, “Be not deceived;
neither fornicators,” (he puts first the one that was already
condemned,) “nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor drunkards, nor
revilers, shall inherit the kingdom of God.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvii-p41">Many have attacked this place as extremely severe,
since he places the drunkard and the reviler with the adulterer and
the abominable and the abuser of himself with mankind. And yet
the offenses are not equal: how then is the award of punishment
the same? What shall we say then? First, that drunkenness is no
small thing nor reviling, seeing that Christ Himself delivered over
to hell him that called his brother Fool. And often that sin has
brought forth death. Again, the Jewish people too committed the
greatest of their sins through drunkenness. In the next place, it
is not of punishment that he is so far discoursing, but of
exclusion from the kingdom. Now from the kingdom both one and the
other are equally thrust out; but whether in hell they will find
any difference, it belongs not to this present occasion to
enquire. For that subject is not before us just now.</p>

you: but ye were washed, but ye were sanctified.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvii-p43">In a way to abash them exceedingly, he adds this: 
as if he said, “Consider from what evils God delivered us; how
great an experiment and demonstration of loving-kindness He
afforded us!  He did not limit His redemption to mere deliverance,
but greatly extended the benefit: for He also made thee clean.
Was this then all? Nay: but He also “sanctified.” Nor
even is this all: He also “justified.” Yet even bare
deliverance from our sins were a great gift: but now He also
filled thee with countless blessing. And this He hath done, “In
the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ;” not in this name or in
that: yea also, “In the Spirit of our God.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvii-p44">Knowing therefore these things, beloved, and bearing
in mind the greatness of the blessing which hath been wrought, let
us both continue to live soberly, being pure from all things that
have been enumerated; and let us avoid the tribunals which are in
the forums of the Gentiles; and the noble birth which God hath
freely given us, the same let us preserve to the end. For think
how full of shame it is that a Greek should take his seat and deal
out justice to thee.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvii-p45">But you will say, what if he that is within judge
contrary to the law? Why should he? tell me. For I would know
by what kind of laws the Greek administers justice, and by what the
Christian? Is it not quite plain that the laws of men are the
rule of the Greek, but those of God, of the Christian? Surely
then with the latter there is greater chance of justice, seeing
that these laws are even sent from heaven. For in regard to those
without, besides what has been said, there are many other things
also to suspect; talent in speakers and corruption in magistrates
and many other things which are the ruin of justice. But with us,
nothing of this sort.</p>

it to submit willingly to what you are likely to endure by
compulsion, and not go to law, that thou mayest have also a
reward. For, (St. <scripRef passage="Matt. v. 40" id="iv.xvii-p46.1" parsed="|Matt|5|40|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.40">Matt.
v. 40</scripRef>.) “If any one
will go to law with thee, and take away thy coat, thou shalt let
him have thy cloak also:” and, (<scripRef passage="Matt. 5.25" id="iv.xvii-p46.2" parsed="|Matt|5|25|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.25">v. 25</scripRef>.) “Agree with thine
adversary quickly, whilst thou art with him in the way.” And
why need I speak of our rules? For even the pleaders in the
heathen courts very often tell us this, saying, “it were better
to make up matters out of court.” But, O wealth, or rather, O
the absurd love of wealth!  It subverts all things and casts them
down; and all things are to the many an idle tale and fables
because of money!  Now that those who give trouble to courts of
laws should be worldly men is no marvel: but that many of those
who have bid farewell to the world should do the very same, this is
a thing from which all pardon is cut off. For if you choose to
see how far you should keep from this sort of need, I mean that of
the tribunals, by rule of the Scripture, and to learn for whom the
laws are appointed, hear what Paul saith; (<scripRef passage="1 Tim. i. 9" id="iv.xvii-p46.3" parsed="|1Tim|1|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.1.9">1 Tim. i. 9</scripRef>.) “For a righteous man law
is not made, but for the lawless, and unruly.” And if he saith
these things about the Mosaic Law, much more about the laws of the
heathen.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvii-p47">[10.] Now then, if you commit injustice, it is
plain that you cannot be righteous: but if you are injured and
bear it, (for this is a special mark of a righteous man,) you have
no need of the laws which are without. “How then,” say you,
“shall I be able to bear it when injured?” And yet Christ
hath commanded something even more than this. For not only hath
he commanded you when injured to bear it, but even to give
abundantly more to the wrong-doer; and in your zeal for suffering
ill to surpass his eagerness for doing it. For he said not, “to
him that will sue thee at law, and take away thy coat, give thy
coat,” but, “together with that give also thy cloak.” But I
bid you overcome him, saith He, by suffering, not by doing, evil: 
for this is the certain and splendid victory. Wherefore also Paul
goes on to say, “Now then it is altogether a defect in (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xvii-p47.1">ἥττημα</span> rec. vers. “a fault.”) you that ye
have lawsuits one with another.” And, “Wherefore do ye not
rather take wrong?” For that the injured person overcomes,
rather than he who cannot endure being injured, this I will make
evident to you. He that cannot endure injury, though he force the
other into court and gain the verdict, yet is he then most of all
defeated. For that which he would not, he hath suffered; in that
the adversary hath compelled him both to feel pain and to go to
law. For what is it to the point that you have prevailed? and
what, that you have recovered all the money? You have in the
meanwhile borne what you did not desire, having been compelled to
decide the matter by law. But if you endure the injustice, you
overcome; deprived indeed of the money, but not at all of the
victory which is annexed to such self-command. For the other had
no power to oblige you to do what you did not like.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvii-p48">And to shew that this is true; tell me, which
conquered at the dunghill? Which was defeated? Job who was
stripped of all, or the devil who stripped him of all? Evidently
the devil who stripped him of all. Whom do we admire for the
victory, the devil that smote, or Job that was smitten? Clearly,
Job. And yet he could not retain his perishing wealth nor save
his children. Why speak I of riches and children? He could not
insure to himself bodily health. Yet nevertheless this is the
conqueror, he that lost all that he had. His riches indeed he
could not keep; but his piety he kept with all strictness. “But
his children when perishing he could not help.” And what
then? Since what happened both made them more glorious, and
besides in this way he protected himself against the despiteful
usage. Now had he not have suffered ill and been wronged of the
devil, he would not have gained that signal victory. Had it been
an evil thing to suffer wrong, God would not have enjoined it upon
us: for God enjoineth not evil things. What, know ye not that
He is the God of Glory? that it could not be His will to encompass
us with shame and ridicule and loss, but to introduce (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xvii-p48.1">προξενῆσαι</span>) us to the contrary of
these? Therefore He commands us to suffer wrong, and doth all to
withdraw us from worldly things, and to convince us what is glory,
and what shame; what loss, and what gain.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvii-p49">“But it is hard to suffer wrong and be spitefully
entreated.” Nay, O man, it is not, it is not hard. How long
will thy heart be fluttering about things present? For God, you
may be sure, would not have commanded this, had it been hard.
Just consider. The wrong-doer goes his way with the money, but
with an evil conscience besides: the receiver of the wrong,
defrauded indeed of some money, but enriched with confidence
towards God; an acquisition more valuable than countless
treasures.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvii-p50">[11.] Knowing these things, therefore, let us of
our free choice go on strict principles, and not be like the
unwise, who think that they are then 
<pb n="95" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_95.html" id="iv.xvii-Page_95" />not wronged, when their suffering wrong is the
result of a trial. But, quite on the contrary, that is the
greatest harm; and so in every case when we exercise self-restraint
in these matters, not willingly, but after being worsted in that
other quarter. For it is no advantage that a man defeated in a
trial endures it; for it becomes thenceforth a matter of
necessity. What then is the splendid victory? When thou lookest
down on it: when thou refusest to go to law.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvii-p51">“How say you? have I been stripped of every
thing,” saith one, “and do you bid me keep silent? Have I
been shamefully used, and do you exhort me to bear it meekly? And
how shall I be able?” Nay, but it is most easy if thou wilt
look up unto heaven; if thou wilt behold the beauty that is in
sight; and whither God hath promised to receive thee, if thou bear
wrong nobly. Do this then; and looking up unto the heaven, think
that thou art made like unto Him that sitteth there upon the
Cherubim. For He also was injured and He bore it; He was
reproached and avenged not Himself; and was beaten, yet He asserted
not His cause. Nay, He made return, in the contrary kind, to
those who did such things, even in benefits without number; and He
commanded us to be imitators of Him. Consider that thou camest
naked out of thy mother’s womb, and that naked both thou and he
that hath done thee wrong shall depart; rather, he for his part,
with innumerable wounds, breeding worms. Consider that things
present are but for a season; count over the tombs of thine
ancestors; acquaint thyself accurately with past events; and thou
shalt see that the wrong-doer hath made thee stronger. For his
own passion he hath aggravated, his covetousness I mean; but yours,
he hath alleviated, taking away the food of the wild beast. And
besides all this, he hath set you free from cares, agony, envy,
informers, trouble, worry, perpetual fear; and the foul mass of
evils he hath heaped upon his own head.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvii-p52">“What then,” saith one, “if I have to struggle
with hunger?” Thou endurest this with Paul, who saith, (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. iv. 10" id="iv.xvii-p52.1" parsed="|1Cor|4|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.4.10">1 Cor. iv. 10</scripRef>.) “Even unto this present
hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked.” But he did it,
you will say, “for God’s sake:” do thou it also for God’s
sake. For when thou abstainest from avenging, thou dost so for
God’s sake.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvii-p53">“But he that wronged me, takes his pleasure with
the wealthy.” Nay, rather with the devil. But be you crowned
with Paul.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvii-p54">Therefore fear not hunger, for (<scripRef passage="Prov. x. 3" id="iv.xvii-p54.1" parsed="|Prov|10|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Prov.10.3">Prov. x. 3</scripRef>.) “the Lord will not kill
with hunger the souls of the righteous.” And again, another
saith, (<scripRef passage="Ps. lv. 23" id="iv.xvii-p54.2" parsed="|Ps|55|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.55.23">Ps. lv. 23</scripRef>.) “Cast upon the Lord thy
care, and He will nourish thee.” For if the sparrows of the
field are nourished by Him, how shall He not nourish thee? Now
let us not be of little faith nor of little soul, O my beloved! 
For He who hath promised the kingdom of heaven and such great
blessings, how shall He not give things present? Let us not covet
superfluous things, but let us keep to a sufficiency, and we shall
always be rich. Let shelter be what we seek and food, and we
shall obtain all things; both these, and such as are far
greater.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvii-p55">But if you are still grieving and bowing down, I
should like to shew you the soul of the wrongdoer after his
victory, how it is become ashes. For truly sin is that kind of
thing: while one commits it, it affords a certain pleasure; but
when it is finished, then the trifling pleasure is gone, one knows
not how, and in its place comes dejection. And this is our
feeling when we do hurt to any: afterwards, at any rate, we
condemn ourselves.  So also when we over-reach we have pleasure;
but afterwards we are stung by conscience. Seest thou in any
one’s possession some poor man’s home? Weep not for him that
is spoiled, but for the spoiler: for he has not inflicted, but
sustained an evil. For he robbed the other of things present; but
himself he cast out of the blessings which cannot be uttered. For
if he who giveth not to the poor shall go away into hell; what
shall he suffer who takes the goods of the poor?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvii-p56">“Yet,” saith one, “where is the gain, if I
suffer ill?” Indeed, the gain is great. For not of the
punishment of him that hath done thee harm doth God frame a
compensation for thee: since that would be no great thing. For
what great good is it, if I suffer ill and he suffer ill? And yet
I know of many, who consider this the greatest comfort, and who
think they have got all back again, when they see those who had
insulted them undergoing punishment. But God doth not limit His
recompense to this.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvii-p57">Wouldest thou then desire to know in earnest how
great are the blessings which await thee? He openeth for thee the
whole heaven; He maketh thee a fellow-citizen with the Saints; He
fits thee to bear a part in their choir: from sins He absolveth;
with righteousness He crowneth. For if such as forgive offenders
shall obtain forgiveness, those who not only forgive but who also
give largely to boot, what blessing shall they not inherit?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvii-p58">Therefore, bear it not with a poor spirit, but even
pray for him that injured thee. It is for thyself that thou dost
this. Hath he taken thy money? Well: he took thy sins too: 
which was the case with Naaman and Gehazi. How much wealth
wouldest thou not give to have thine iniquities forgiven thee? 
This, believe me, is the case now. For if thou endure nobly and
<pb n="96" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_96.html" id="iv.xvii-Page_96" />curse not, thou hast bound on
thee a glorious crown. It is not my word, but thou hast heard
Christ speaking, “Pray for those that despitefully use you.”
And consider the reward how great!  “That ye may be like your
Father which is in the heavens.” So then you have been deprived
of nothing, yea, you have been a gainer: you have received no
wrongs, rather you have been crowned; in that you are become better
disciplined in soul; are made like to God; are set free from the
care of money; are made possessor of the kingdom of heaven.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xvii-p59">All these things therefore taking into account, let
us restrain ourselves in injuries, beloved, in order that we may
both be freed from the tumult of this present life, and cast out
all unprofitable sadness of spirit, and may obtain the joy to come;
through the grace and loving-kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ,
with Whom to the Father and the Holy Spirit be glory, power, honor,
now, henceforth, and for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p class="c27" id="iv.xviii-p3">“All things are lawful for me, but not all things

brought into the power of any.</p>

<p class="c24" id="iv.xviii-p4"><span class="c18" id="iv.xviii-p4.1">Here</span> he glances at the
gluttons. For since he intends to assail the fornicator again,
and fornication arises from luxuriousness and want of moderation,
he strongly chastises this passion. It cannot be that he speaks
thus with regard to things forbidden, such not being
“lawful:” but of things which seem to be indifferent. To
illustrate my meaning: “It is lawful,” he says, “to eat and
to drink; but it is not expedient with excess.” And so that
marvellous and unexpected turn of his, which he is often wont to
adopt; (Cf. <scripRef passage="Rom. xii. 21; 1 Cor. vii. 23" id="iv.xviii-p4.2" parsed="|Rom|12|21|0|0;|1Cor|7|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.12.21 Bible:1Cor.7.23">Rom. xii. 21;
1 Cor. vii. 23</scripRef>.) bringing
his argument clear round to its contrary, this he manages to
introduce here also; and he signifies that to do what is in one’s
power not only is not expedient, but even is not a part of power,
but of slavery.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xviii-p5">And first, he dissuades them on the ground of the
inexpediency of the thing, saying, “they are not expedient:”
in the next place, on that of its contrariety to itself, saying,
“I will not be brought under the power of any.” This is his
meaning: “You are at liberty to eat,” says he; “well then,
remain in liberty, and take heed that you do not become a slave to
this appetite: for he who uses it properly, he is master of it;
but he that exceeds the proper measure is no longer its master but
its slave, since gluttony reigns paramount within him.” Do you
perceive how, where the man thought he had authority Paul points
out that he is under authority? For this is his custom, as I was
saying before, to give all objections a turn the contrary way. It
is just this which he has done here. For mark; each of them was
saying, “I have power to live luxuriously.” He replies, “In
doing so, thou art not so much acting as one who had power over a
thing, but rather as being thyself subject to some such power.
For thou hast not power even over thine own belly, so long as thou
art dissolute, but it hath power over thee.” And the same we
may say both of riches and of other things.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xviii-p6"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 6.13" id="iv.xviii-p6.1" parsed="|1Cor|6|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.6.13">Ver. 13</scripRef>. “Meats for the
belly.” By “the belly” here he means not the stomach, but
the stomach’s voraciousness. As when he says, (<scripRef passage="Philip. iii. 19" id="iv.xviii-p6.2" parsed="|Phil|3|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Phil.3.19">Philip. iii. 19</scripRef>.) “Whose God is their
belly:” not speaking about that part of the body, but about
greediness. To prove that so it is, hear what follows: “And
the belly for meats; but the body is not for fornication, but for
the Lord.” And yet “the belly” also is of “the body.”
But he puts down two pairs of things, “meats” and gluttony,
(which he terms “the belly;”) “Christ,” and “the
body.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xviii-p7">What then is the meaning of, “Meats for the
belly?” “Meats,” he says, are on good terms with gluttony,
and it with them. It cannot therefore lead us unto Christ, but
drags towards these. For it is a strong and brutal passion, and
makes us slaves, and puts us upon ministering to the belly. Why
then art thou excited and gaping after food, O man? For the end
of that service is this, and nothing further shall be seen of it: 
but as one was waiting on some mistress, it abides keeping up this
slavery, and advances no further, and has no other employment but
this same fruitless one. And the two are connected together and
destroyed together; “the belly” with “the meats,” and
“the meats” with “the belly;” winding out a sort of
interminable course; just as from a corrupt body worms may be
produced, and again by worms the body consumed; or as it were a
wave swoln high and breaking, and having no fur<pb n="97" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_97.html" id="iv.xviii-Page_97" />ther effect. But these things he
says not concerning food and the body, but it is the passion of
greediness and excess in eatables which he is censuring: and what
follows shews it. For he proceeds:</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xviii-p8">“But God shall bring to nought both it and
them:” speaking not of the stomach, but of immoderate desire: 
not of food but of high feeding. For with the former he is not
angry, but even lays down rules about them, saying, (<scripRef passage="1 Tim. vi. 8" id="iv.xviii-p8.1" parsed="|1Tim|6|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.6.8">1 Tim. vi. 8</scripRef>.) “Having food and covering
we shall be therewith content.” However, thus he stigmatizes
the whole thing; its amendment (after advice given) being left by
him to prayer.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xviii-p9">But some say that the words are a prophecy,
declaring the state which shall be in the life to come, and that
there is no eating or drinking there. Now if that which is
moderate shall have an end, much more ought we to abstain from
excess.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xviii-p10">Then lest any one should suppose that the body is
the object of his censure, and suspect that from a part he is
blaming the whole, and say that the nature of the body was the
cause of gluttony or of fornication, hear what follows. “I
blame not,” he says, “the nature of the body, but the
immoderate license of the mind.” And therefore he subjoins,
“Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord;” for it
was not formed for this purpose, to live riotously and commit
fornication, as neither was the belly to be greedy; but that it
might follow Christ as a Head, and that the Lord might be set over
the body. Let us be overcome with shame, let us be horror-struck,
that after we have been counted worthy of such great honor as to
become members of Him that sitteth on high, we defile ourselves
with so great evils.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xviii-p11">[2.] Having now sufficiently condemned the
glutton, he uses also the hope of things to come to divert us from
this wickedness: saying,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xviii-p12"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 6.14" id="iv.xviii-p12.1" parsed="|1Cor|6|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.6.14">Ver. 14</scripRef>. And God both raised up the
Lord, and will raise up us also through His power.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xviii-p13">Do you perceive again his Apostolical wisdom? For
he is always establishing the credibility of the Resurrection from
Christ, and especially now. For if our body be a member of
Christ, and Christ be risen, the body also shall surely follow the
Head.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xviii-p14">“Through his power.” For since he had asserted
a thing disbelieved and not to be apprehended by reasonings, he
hath left entirely to His incomprehensible power the circumstances
of Christ’s own Resurrection, producing this too as no small
demonstration against them. And concerning the Resurrection of
Christ he did not insert this: for he did not say, “And God
shall also raise up the Lord;”—for the thing was past and
gone;—but how? “And God both raised up the Lord;” nor was
there need of any proof. But concerning our resurrection, since
it has not yet come to pass, he spoke not thus, but how? “And
will raise up us also through His power:” by the reliance to be
placed on the power of the Worker, he stops the mouths of the
gainsayers.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xviii-p15">Further: if he ascribe unto the Father the
Resurrection of Christ, let not this at all disturb thee. For not
as though Christ were powerless, hath he put this down, for He it
is Himself who saith, (S. 
<scripRef passage="John ii. 19" id="iv.xviii-p15.1" parsed="|John|2|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.2.19">John ii. 19</scripRef>.) “Destroy this Temple, and
in three days I will raise it up:” and again, (S. <scripRef passage="John x. 18" id="iv.xviii-p15.2" parsed="|John|10|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.10.18">John x. 18</scripRef>.) “I have power to lay down
My life, and I have power to take it again.” And Luke also in
the Acts says, (c. <scripRef passage="Acts 1.3" id="iv.xviii-p15.3" parsed="|Acts|1|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.1.3">i. 3</scripRef>.)
“To whom also He shewed Himself alive.” Wherefore then does
Paul so speak? Because both the acts of the Son are imputed unto
the Father, and the Father’s unto the Son. For He saith, (S.
<scripRef passage="John v. 19" id="iv.xviii-p15.4" parsed="|John|5|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.5.19">John v. 19</scripRef>.) “Whatsoever things He
doeth, these the Son also doeth in like manner.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xviii-p16">And very opportunely he here made mention of the
Resurrection, keeping down by those hopes the tyranny of gluttonous
desire; and all but saying, Thou hast eaten, hast drunk to
excess: and what is the result? Nothing, save only
destruction. Thou hast been conjoined unto Christ; and what is
the result? A great and marvellous thing: the future
Resurrection, that glorious one, and transcending all
utterance!</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xviii-p17">[3.] Let no one therefore go on disbelieving the
Resurrection: but if a man disbelieve, let him think how many
things He made from nothing, and admit it as a proof also of the
other. For the things which are already past are stranger by far,
and fraught with overpowering wonder. Just consider. He took
earth and mixed it, and made man; earth which existed not before
this. How then did the earth become man? And how was it
produced from nothing? And, how, all the things that were made
from it? the endless sorts of irrational creatures; of seeds; of
plants; no pangs of travail having preceded in the one case, no
rains having come down upon the others; no tillage seen, no oxen,
no plough, nor any thing else contributing to their production? 
Why, for this cause the lifeless and senseless thing was made to
put forth in the beginning so many kinds of plants and irrational
creatures, in order that from the very first He might instruct thee
in the doctrine of Resurrection. For this is more inexplicable
than the Resurrection. For it is not the same thing to rekindle
an extinguished lamp, and to shew fire that has never yet
appeared. It is not the same thing to raise up again a house
which has fallen down, and to produce one which has never at all
had an exist<pb n="98" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_98.html" id="iv.xviii-Page_98" />ence. For in the
former case, if nothing else, yet the material was given to work
with: but in the latter, not even the substance appeared.
Wherefore He made first that which seemed to be the more difficult,
to the end that hereby thou mightest admit that which is the more
easy; more difficult, I say, not to God, but as far as our
reasonings can follow the subject. For with God nothing is
difficult: but as the painter who has made one likeness will make
ten thousand with ease, so also with God it is easy to make worlds
without number and end. Rather, as it is easy for you to conceive
a city and worlds without bound, so unto God is it easy to make
them; or rather again it is easier by far. For thou consumest
time, brief though it be, in thy conception; but God not even this,
but as much as stones are heavier than any of the lightest things,
yea even than our minds; so much is our mind surpassed by the
rapidity of God’s work of creation.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xviii-p18">Do you marvel at His power on the earth? Think
again how the heaven was made, not yet being; how the innumerable
stars, how the sun, how the moon; and all these things not yet
being. Again, tell me how after they were made they stood fast,
and upon what? What foundation have they? and what the earth? 
What comes next to the earth? and again, what after that which came
next to the earth? Do you see into what an eddy the eye of your
mind is plunged, unless you quickly take refuge in faith and the
incomprehensible power of the Maker?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xviii-p19">But if you choose from human things also to make
conjecture, you will be able by degrees to find wings for your
understanding. “What kind of human things?” may be asked.
Do you not see the potters, how they fashion the vase which had
been broken in pieces and become shapeless? Those who fuse the
ore from the mine, how the earth in their hands turns out (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xviii-p19.1">τὴν  γῆν χρύσιον ἀποφαίνουσι</span>) gold, or silver, or
copper? Others again who work in glass, how they transform the
sand into one compact and transparent substance? Shall I speak of
the dressers of leather, the dyers of purple vestments; how they
make that which had received their tint shew as one thing, when it
had been another? Shall I speak of the generation of our own
race? Doth not a small seed, at first without form and impress,
enter into the womb which receives it? Whence then the so
intricate formation of the living creature? What is the wheat? 
Is it not cast a naked seed into the earth? After it has been
cast there, doth it not decay? Whence is the ear, the beard, the
stalk, and all the other parts? Doth not often a little grain of
a fig fall into the ground, and produce both root, and branches,
and fruit? And dost thou hereupon admit each of these and make no
curious enquiries, and of God alone dost thou demand account, in
His work of changing the fashion of our body? And how can such
things be pardonable?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xviii-p20">These things and such like we say to the Greeks.
For to those who are obedient to the Scriptures, I have no occasion
to speak at all.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xviii-p21">I say, if you intend to pry curiously into all His
doings, what shall God have more than men? And yet even of men
there are many about whom we do not so enquire. Much more then
ought we to abstain from impertinent inquiry about the wisdom of
God, and from demanding accounts of it: in the first place,
because He is trustworthy who affirmeth: in the second place,
because the matter admits not investigation by reasonings. For
God is not so abjectly poor as to work such things only as can be
apprehended by the weakness of thy reasonings. And if thou
comprehendest not the work of an artisan, much less of God, the
best of artificers. Disbelieve not then the Resurrection, for
very far will ye be from the hope of that which is to come.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xviii-p22">But what is the wise argument of the gain-sayers;
rather, I should say, their exceeding senseless one? “Why how,
when the body is mixed up with the earth and is become earth, and
this again is removed elsewhere, how,” say they, “shall it rise
again?” To thee this seems impossible, but not to the
unsleeping Eye. For unto that all things are clear. And thou in
that confusion seest no distinction of parts; but He knows them
all. Since also the heart of thy neighbor thou knowest not, nor
the things in it; but He knoweth all. If then, because of thy not
knowing how God raiseth men up, thou believest not that He doth
raise them, wilt thou disbelieve that He knoweth also what is in
thy mind? for neither is that obvious to view. And yet in the
body it is visible matter, though it be dissolved: but those
thoughts are invisible. Shall He then who knoweth with all
certainty the invisible things, not see the things which be
visible, and easily distinguish the scattered parts of the body? 
I suppose this is plain to every one.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xviii-p23">Do not then disbelieve the Resurrection; for this is
a doctrine of the Devil. This is what the Devil is earnest for,
not only that the Resurrection may be disbelieved, but good works
also may be done away with. For the man who does not expect that
he shall rise again and give an account of the things which he has
done, will not quickly apply himself to virtue; will in turn come
to disbelieve the Resurrection entirely: for both these are
established by each other; vice by unbelief, and unbelief by
vice. For the conscience filled with many wicked<pb n="99" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_99.html" id="iv.xviii-Page_99" />nesses, fearing and trembling for the
recompense to come and not willing to provide itself with comfort
by changing to what is most excellent, is fain to repose in
unbelief. Thus when thou deniest resurrection and judgment, the
other for his part will say, “Then shall I also not have to
render account of my bold deeds.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xviii-p24">[4.] But why saith Christ? (St. <scripRef passage="Matt. xxii. 29" id="iv.xviii-p24.1" parsed="|Matt|22|29|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.22.29">Matt. xxii. 29</scripRef>.) “Ye do err, not knowing
the Scriptures, nor the power of God.” For God would not have
wrought so many things, had He intended not to raise us up again,
but to dissolve and blot us out in annihilation. He would not
have spread out this heaven, He would not have stretched the earth
beneath, He would not have made all the rest of the universe only
for this short life. But if all these are for the present, what
will He not do for that which is to come? If, on the contrary,
there is to be no future life, we are in this respect of far meaner
account than the things which have been made for our sakes. For
both the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and the rivers, are
more lasting than we are: and some even of the brutes; since the
raven, and the race of elephants, and many other creatures, have a
longer enjoyment of the present life. To us, moreover, life is
both short and toilsome, but not to them. Theirs is both long,
and freer from grief and cares.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xviii-p25">“What then? tell me:  hath he made the slaves
better than the masters?” Do not, I beseech thee, do not reason
thus, O man, nor be so poverty-stricken in mind, nor be ignorant of
the riches of God, having such a Master. For even from the
beginning God desired to make thee immortal, but thou wert not
willing. Since the things also of that time were dark hints of
immortality: the converse with God; the absence of uneasiness
from life; the freedom from grief, and cares, and toils, and other
things which belong to a temporary existence. For Adam had no
need either of a garment or a shelter, or any other provision of
this sort; but rather was like to the Angels; and many of the
things to come he foreknew, and was filled with great wisdom.
Even what God did in secret, he knew, I mean with regard to the
woman: wherefore also he said, “This is now bone of my bone,
and flesh of my flesh.” (<scripRef passage="Gen. ii. 23" id="iv.xviii-p25.1" parsed="|Gen|2|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.2.23">Gen. ii. 23</scripRef>.) Labor came into being
afterwards: so did sweat, so did shame, and cowardice, and want
of confidence. But on that day there was no grief, nor pain, nor
lamentation. But he abode not in that dignity.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xviii-p26">What then, saith one, am I to do? must I perish on
his account? I reply, first, It is not on his account: for
neither hast thou remained without sin: though it be not the same
sin, at least there is some other which thou hast committed. And
again, you have not been injured by his punishment, but rather have
been a gainer. For if you had been to remain altogether mortal,
perchance what is said would have had some reason in it. But now
thou art immortal, and if thou wilt, thou mayest shine brighter
than the sun itself.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xviii-p27">[5.] “But,” says one, “had I not received a
mortal body, I had not sinned.” Tell me then, had he a mortal
body when he sinned? Surely not: for if it had been mortal
before, it would not have undergone death as a punishment
afterwards. And that a mortal body is no hindrance to virtue, but
that it keeps men in order and is of the greatest service, is plain
from what follows. If the expectation of immortality alone so
lifted up Adam; had he been even immortal in reality, to what a
pitch of arrogance would he not have proceeded? And as things
are, after sinning you may do away with your sins, the body being
abject, falling away, and subject to dissolution: for these
thoughts are sufficient to sober a man. But if you had sinned in
an immortal body, your sins were likely to have been more
lasting.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xviii-p28">Mortality then is not the cause of sin: accuse it
not: but the wicked will is the root of all the mischief. For
why was not Abel at all the worse for his body? Why are the
devils not at all the better for being incorporeal? Wilt thou
hear why the body’s becoming mortal, so far from hurting, has
been positively useful? Mark how much thou gainest thereby, if
thou art sober. It drags thee back and pulls thee off from
wickedness, by griefs and pains and labors and other such things.
“But it tempts men to uncleanness,” perhaps you will say. Not
the body, but incontinence, doth this. For all these things which
I was mentioning certainly do belong to the body: on which
account it is impossible that a man who has entered into this life
should escape disease and pain and lowness of spirits: but that
he commit no uncleanness is possible. Thus it appears that if the
affections of vice were part of the nature of the body they would
be universal: since all things natural are so; but to commit
fornication is not so. Pain indeed cometh of nature: but to
commit fornication proceeds from deliberate purpose.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xviii-p29">Blame not the body then; let not the Devil take away
thine honor, which God hath given thee. For if we choose, the
body is an excellent bridle to curb the wanton sallies of the soul,
to pull down haughtiness, to repress arrogance, to minister to us
in the greatest achievements of virtue. For tell me not of those
who have lost their senses; since we often see horses, after they
have thrown out their drivers, dashing with their reins over the
precipices, and yet we do not blame the rein. For it is not the
breaking of that which caused it all, but the 
<pb n="100" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_100.html" id="iv.xviii-Page_100" />driver not holding them in was the ruin of every
thing. Just so do thou reason in this case. If thou seest a
young person living in orphanhood and doing innumerable evil
things, blame not the body, but the charioteer who is dragged on, I
mean, the man’s faculty of reasoning. For as the reins give no
trouble to the charioteer, but the charioteer is the cruise of all
the mischief through his not holding them properly: (and
therefore do they often exact a penalty of him, entangling
themselves with him, and dragging him on, and compelling him to
partake in their own mishap:)  so is it also in the case before
us. “I,” say the reins, “made bloody the horse’s mouth as
long as you held me: but since you threw me away, I require
satisfaction for your contempt, and I entwine myself about you, and
drag you along, so as not to incur the same usage again.” Let
no one then blame the reins, but himself and his own corrupt
mind. For over us too is a charioteer, even reason: and the
reins are the body, connecting the horses with the charioteer; if
then these be in good condition, you will suffer no harm: but if
you let them go, you have annihilated and ruined every thing. Let
us be temperate then, and lay all blame not on the body, but on the
evil mind. For this is the Devil’s special work, to make
foolish men accuse the body and God and their neighbor, rather than
their own perverted minds; lest, having discovered the cause, they
get free from the root of the evils.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xviii-p30">But do ye, being aware of his design, direct your
wrath against him: and having set the charioteer upon the car,
bend the eye of your minds towards God. For in all other
instances he that appoints the games contributes nothing, but only
awaits the end. But in this case, He is all in all, who appointed
the contest, even God. Him therefore let us render propitious,
and surely we shall obtain the blessings in store; through the
grace and loving-kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, to Whom, with
the Father and the Holy Spirit, be glory, power, honor, now,
henceforth, and for evermore. Amen.</p>

<p class="c27" id="iv.xix-p3">“Know ye not that your bodies are members of
Christ? Shall I then take away the members of Christ, and make
them members of a harlot? God forbid.</p>

<p class="c24" id="iv.xix-p4"><span class="c18" id="iv.xix-p4.1">Having</span> passed on from the
fornicator to the covetous person, he comes back to the former from
the latter, no longer henceforth discoursing with him but with the
others who had not committed fornication. And in the act of
securing them lest they fall into the same sins, he assails him
again. For he that has committed sin, though you direct your
words to another, is stung even in that way; his conscience being
thoroughly awakened and scourging him.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xix-p5">Now the fear of punishment indeed was enough to keep
them in chastity. But seeing that he does not wish by fear alone
to set these matters right, he uses both threatenings and
reasons.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xix-p6">Now upon that other occasion, having stated the sin,
and prescribed the punishment, and pointed out the harm which
intercourse with the fornicator brought upon all, he left off, and
passed to the subject of covetousness: and having threatened the
covetous and all the rest whom he mentioned with expulsion from the
kingdom, he so concluded his discourse. But here he takes in hand
the work of admonition in a yet more terrific manner. For as he
that only punishes a sin and does nothing to point out its most
extreme lawlessness, produces no such great effect by his
chastisement: so again, he who only abashes and fails to terrify
by his mode of punishing, does not very keenly hit men of hardened
minds. Wherefore Paul does both: here he abashes, saying,
“Know ye not that we shall judge angels?” there again he
terrifies, saying, “Know ye not that the covetous shall not
inherit the kingdom of God?”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xix-p7">And in regard to the fornicator, he again uses this
order of discourse. For having terrified him by what he had said
before; first cutting him off and delivering him to Satan, and then
reminding him of that day which is coming; he abashes him again by
saying, “Know ye not that your bodies are members of Christ?”
thenceforth speaking as to children of noble birth. For whereas
he had said, “Now the body is for the Lord,” he indicates it
more plainly now. And in another place as well he does this same
thing, saying, (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. 12.27" id="iv.xix-p7.1" parsed="|1Cor|12|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.12.27">xii. 27</scripRef>.) “Now ye are the body of
Christ, and severally members thereof.” And the same figure he
often employs, not with the 
<pb n="101" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_101.html" id="iv.xix-Page_101" />same aim, but at one time to shew His love, and
at another to increase their fear. But here he has employed it to
startle and fill them with alarm. “Shall I then take the
members of Christ, and make them members of a harlot? God
forbid.” Nothing can be apter to strike horror than this
expression. He said not, “Shall I take the members of Christ,
and join them on to a harlot?” but what? “make them members of
a harlot;” which surely would strike more keenly.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xix-p8">Then he makes out how the fornicator becomes this,
saying thus, “Know ye not that he that is joined unto a harlot is
one body?” How is this evident? “For the twain, saith He,
shall become one.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xix-p9"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 6.17" id="iv.xix-p9.1" parsed="|1Cor|6|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.6.17">Ver. 17</scripRef>. “But he that is joined
unto the Lord is one spirit.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xix-p10">For the conjunction suffers the two no longer to be
two, but makes them both one.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xix-p11">[2.] Now mark again, how he proceeds by means of
the bare terms, conducting his accusation in the names of the
harlot and of Christ.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xix-p12"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 6.18" id="iv.xix-p12.1" parsed="|1Cor|6|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.6.18">Ver. 18</scripRef>. “Flee fornication.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xix-p13">He said not, “abstain from fornication,” but
“Flee:” that is, with all zeal make to yourselves deliverance
from that evil. “Every sin that a man doeth is without the
body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own
body.” This is less than what went before; but since he had to
speak of fornicators, he amplifies that guilt by topics drawn from
all quarters, from greater things and smaller alike, making the
charge heinous. And, in fact, that former topic was addressed to
the more religious, but this to the weaker sort. For this also is
characteristic of the wisdom of Paul, not only to allege the great
things wherewith to abash men, but the lesser also, and the
consideration of what is disgraceful and unseemly.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xix-p14">“What then,” say you, “does not the murderer
stain his hand? What, of the covetous person and the
extortioner?” I suppose it is plain to every one. But since
it was not possible to mention anything worse than the fornicator,
he amplifies the crime in another way, by saying that in the
fornicator the entire body becomes defiled. For it is as polluted
as if it had fallen into a vessel of filth, and been immersed in
defilement. And this too is our way. For from covetousness and
extortion no one would make haste to go into a bath, but as if
nothing had happened returns to his house. Whereas from
intercourse with a harlot, as having become altogether unclean, he
goes to a bath. To such a degree does the conscience retain from
this sin a kind of sense of unusual shame. Both however are bad,
both covetousness and fornication; and both cast into hell. But
as Paul doeth every thing with good management, so by whatever
topics he had he magnified the sin of fornication.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xix-p15">[3.] <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 6.19" id="iv.xix-p15.1" parsed="|1Cor|6|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.6.19">Ver. 19</scripRef>. “Know ye not that your
body is a temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you?” He did not
merely say, “of the Spirit,” but, “which is in you;” which
was the part of one who also was soothing. And again, explaining
himself still further, he added, “which ye have from God.” He
mentioned Him that gave also, both exalting the hearer and putting
him in fear, both by the magnitude of the deposit, and by the
munificence of Him that made it.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xix-p16">“And ye are not your own.” This is not only to
abash, but even to force men towards virtue. “For why,” says
he; “doest thou what thou wilt? thou art not thine own
master.” But these things he said, not to take away
free-will. For so in saying, “All things are lawful for me, but
not all things are expedient,” he does not take away our
liberty. And here again, writing, “Ye are not your own;” he
makes no infringement upon freedom of choice, but he leads away
from vice and indicates the guardian care of the Lord. And
therefore he added, “For ye were bought with a price.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xix-p17">“But if I am not my own, upon what ground do you
demand of me duties to be done? And why do you go on to say
again, “Glorify God therefore in your body and in your spirit,
which are God’s?” What then is the meaning of, “ye are not
your own?” And what does he wish to prove thereby? To settle
them in a state of security against sin, and against following the
improper desires of the mind. For indeed we have many improper
wishes: but we must repress them, for we can. And if we could
not, exhortation would be in vain. Mark, accordingly, how he
secures his ground. For having said, “Ye are not your own,”
he adds not, “But are under compulsion;” but, “Ye were bought
with a price.” Why sayest thou this? Surely on another
ground, one might say perhaps, you should have persuaded men,
pointing out that we have a Master. But this is common to the
Greeks also together with us: whereas the expression, “Ye were
bought with a price,” belongs to us peculiarly. For he reminds
us of the greatness of the benefit and of the mode of our
salvation, signifying that when we were alienated, we were
“bought:” and not simply “bought,” but, “with a
price.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xix-p18">“Glorify then, take up and bear,<note place="end" n="82" id="iv.xix-p18.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xix-p19">

[The last clause, <i>and in your spirit, which are

things <pb n="102" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_102.html" id="iv.xix-Page_102" />he says, that we
may not only flee fornication in the body, but also in the spirit
of our mind abstain from every wicked thought, and from driving
away grace.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xix-p21">“Which are God’s.” For as he had said
“your,” he added therefore, “which are God’s:”
continually reminding us that all things belong to the Lord, both
body and soul and spirit: For some say, that the words “in the
spirit” mean the gracious Gift; for if That be in us, God is
glorified. And this will be, if we have a clean heart.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xix-p22">But He has spoken of these things as God’s, not
only because He brought them into being, but also because, when
they were alienated, He won them again a second time, paying as the
price, the blood of the Son. Mark how He brought the whole to
completion in Christ, how He raised us up into heaven. “Ye are
members of Christ,” saith he, “ye are a temple of the
Spirit.” Become not then “members of a harlot:” for it is
not your body which is insulted; since it is not your body at all,
but Christ’s. And these things he spake, both to make manifest
His loving-kindness in that our body is His, and to withdraw us
from all evil license. For if the body be another’s, “you
have no authority,” says he, “to insult another’s body; and
especially when it is the Lord’s; nor yet to pollute a temple of
the Spirit.” For if any one who invades a private house and
makes his way revelling into it, must answer for it most severely;
think what dreadful things he shall endure who makes a temple of
the King a robber’s lurking place.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xix-p23">Considering these things therefore, reverence thou
Him that dwelleth within. For the Paraclete is He. Thrill
before Him that is enfolded and cleaves unto thee; for Christ is
He. Hast thou indeed made thyself members of Christ? Think
thus, and continue chaste; whose members they were, and Whose they
have become. Erewhile they were members of an harlot, and Christ
hath made them members of His own Body. Thou hast therefore
henceforth no authority over them. Serve Him that hath set thee
free.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xix-p24">For supposing you had a daughter, and in extreme
madness had let her out to a procurer for hire, and made her live a
harlot’s life, and then a king’s son were to pass by, and free
her from that slavery, and join her in marriage to himself; you
could have no power thenceforth to bring her into the brothel.
For you gave her up once for all, and sold her. Such as this is
our case also. We let out our own flesh for hire unto the Devil,
that grievous procurer: Christ saw and set it free, and withdrew
it from that evil tyranny; it is not then ours any more but His who
delivered it. If you be willing to use it as a King’s bride,
there is none to hinder; but if you bring it where it was before,
you will suffer just what they ought who are guilty of such
outrages. Wherefore you should rather adorn instead of disgracing
it. For you have no authority over the flesh in the wicked lusts,
but in those things alone which God may enjoin. Let the thought
enter your mind at least from what great outrage God hath delivered
it. For in truth never did any harlot expose herself so
shamefully as our nature before this. For robberies, murders, and
every wicked thought entered in and lay with the soul, and for a
small and vulgar hire, the present pleasure. For the soul, being
mixed up with all wicked devices and deeds, reaped this reward and
no other.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xix-p25">However, in the time before this, bad though it were
to be such as these, it was not so bad: but after heaven, after
the King’s courts, after partaking of the tremendous Mysteries,
again to be contaminated, what pardon shall this have? Or, dost
thou not think that the covetous too, and all those whom he
recounted before, have the Devil to lie with them? And dost thou
not judge that the women who beautify themselves for pollution have
intercourse with him? Why, who shall gainsay this word? But if
any be contentious, let him uncover the soul of the women who
behave in this unseemly manner, and he will surely see that the
wicked demon closely entwined with them. For it is hard,
brethren, it is hard, perchance even impossible, when the body is
thus beautified, for the soul to be beautified at the same time: 
but one must needs be neglected, while the other is cared for.
For nature does not allow these to take place together.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xix-p26">[4.] Wherefore he saith, “He that is joined to a
harlot is one body; but he that is joined to the Lord is one
Spirit.” For such an one becomes thenceforth Spirit, although a
body envelope him. For when nothing corporeal nor gross nor
earthly is around him, the body doth but merely envelope him; since
the whole government of him is in the soul and the Spirit. In
this way God is glorified. Wherefore both in the Prayer we are
commanded to say, “Hallowed be Thy Name:” and Christ saith
also, “Let your light shine before men, that they may see your
good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xix-p27">So do the heavens also glorify Him, uttering no
voice, but by the view of them attracting wonder and referring the
glory unto the Great Artificer. So let us glorify Him also, or
rather more than they. For we can if we will. For not so much
do the heaven nor day nor night glorify God, as a holy soul. For
as one that gazeth upon the beauty of the heaven, saith, <pb n="103" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_103.html" id="iv.xix-Page_103" />“Glory be to Thee, O God!  How
fair a work hast thou formed!” so too when beholding virtue in
any man: nay, and much more so in the latter instance. For from
these works of creation all do not glorify God; but many even
assert that the things which exist are self-moving: and others
impute to demons the workmanship of the world and providence; and
these indeed greatly and unpardonably err: but in regard to the
virtue of man, no one shall have power to hold these shameless
opinions, but shall assuredly glorify God when he seeth him that
serveth Him living in goodness. For who shall help being
astonished when one being a man, and partaking of our common
nature, and living among other men, like adamant yields not at all
to the swarm of passions? When being in the midst of fire and
iron and wild beasts, he is even harder than adamant and vanquishes
all for the Word of godliness’ sake? when he is injured, and
blesses; when he is evil reported of, and praises; when he is
despitefully used, and prays for those who injure him; when he is
plotted against, and does good to those that fight with him and lay
snares for him? For these things, and such as these, will glorify
God far more than the heaven. For the Greeks when they behold the
heavens feel no awe; but when they see a holy man exhibiting a
severe course of life with all strictness, they shrink away and
condemn themselves. Since when he that partakes of the same
nature as themselves is so much above them, a great deal more so
than the heaven is above the earth, even against their inclination
they think that it is a Divine power which works these things.
Wherefore He saith, “And glorify your Father which is in
heaven.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xix-p28">[5.] Wilt thou learn also from another place how
by the life of His servants God is glorified, and how by
miracles? Nebuchadnezzar once threw the Three Children into the
furnace. Then when he saw that the fire had not prevailed over
them, he saith, (<scripRef passage="Dan. iii. 28" id="iv.xix-p28.1" parsed="|Dan|3|28|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Dan.3.28">Dan. iii.
28</scripRef>. LXX. <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xix-p28.2">ἐκ τῆς  καμίνου</span> added.) “Blessed be God, who hath sent His Angel,
and delivered his servants out of the furnace, because they trusted
in Him and have changed the word of the king.” “How sayest
thou? Hast thou been despised, and dost thou admire those who
have spit upon you?” “Yes,” saith he, “and for this very
reason, that I was despised.” And of the marvel he gives this
reason. So that not because of the miracle alone was glory given
to God at that time, but also because of the purpose of those who
have been thrown in. Now if any one would examine this point and
the other, as they are in themselves, this will appear not less
than that: for to persuade souls to brave a furnace is not less
in respect of the wonder than to deliver from a furnace. For how
can it be otherwise than astonishing for the Emperor of the world,
with so many arms around him, and legions, and generals, and
viceroys, and consuls, and land and sea subject to his sway, to be
despised by captive children; for the bound to overcome the binder
and conquer all that army? Neither was there any power in the
king and his company to do what they would, no, not even with the
furnaces for an ally. But they who were naked, and slaves, and
strangers, and few, (for what number could be more contemptible
than three?) being in chains, vanquished an innumerable army. For
already now was death despised, since Christ was henceforth about
to sojourn in the world. And as when the sun is on the point of
rising, even before his rays appear the light of the day groweth
bright; so also when then the Sun of Righteousness was about to
come, death henceforth began to withdraw himself. What could be
more splendid than that theatre? What more conspicuous than that
victory? What more signal than those new trophies of theirs?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xix-p29">The same thing is done in our time also.
Even now is there a king of the Babylonish furnace, even now he
kindles a flame fiercer than that. There is even now such an
image, and one who giveth command to admire it. At his side are
satraps and soldiers and bewitching music. And many gaze in
admiration upon this image, so varied, so great. For somewhat of
the same kind of thing as that image is covetousness, which doth
not despise even iron<note place="end" n="84" id="iv.xix-p29.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xix-p30">
St. Chrysostom evidently considers the image which Nebuchadnezzar
set up as intended to represent the image which he had seen in his
dream.</p></note>, but unlike as the materials are
whereof it is composed, it giveth command to admire all, both brass
and iron, and things much more ordinary than they.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xix-p31">But as these things are, so also even now are
there some who are emulous of these children: who say, “thy
gods we serve not, and thine images we worship not;” but both the
furnace of poverty we endure and all other distress, for the sake
of God’s laws.” And the wealthy for their part, even as those
at that time, oftentimes, worship this image too and are burnt.
But those who possess nothing despite even this, and although in
poverty, are more in the dew<note place="end" n="85" id="iv.xix-p31.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xix-p32">
<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xix-p32.1">Μᾶλλον εἰσὶ ἐν δρόσῳ</span>. Alluding to

than those who live in affluence. Even as at that time they who
cast into the fire were burnt up; but those in the midst of it
found themselves in dew as it were rain. Then also that tyrant
was more burnt up with the flame, his wrath kindling him violently,
than those children. As to them, the fire had no power even to
touch the <pb n="104" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_104.html" id="iv.xix-Page_104" />ends of their
hair: but more fiercely than that fire did wrath burn up his
mind. For consider what a thing it was that with so many to look
on, he should be scorned by captive children. And it was a sign
that his taking their city also had not been through his own might,
but by reason of the sin of the multitude among them. Since if he
had not the power to overcome these men in chains, and that when
they were cast into a furnace, how could he have overcome the Jews
in regular warfare, had they been all such as these? From which
it is plain that the sins of the multitude betrayed the city.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xix-p33">[6.] But mark also the children’s freedom from
vain-glory. For they did not leap into the furnace, but they kept
beforehand the commandment of Christ where he says, (St. <scripRef passage="Matt. xxvi. 41" id="iv.xix-p33.1" parsed="|Matt|26|41|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.26.41">Matt. xxvi. 41</scripRef>.) “Pray that ye enter not
into temptation.” Neither did they shrink when they were
brought to it; but stood in the midst nobly, neither contending
without a summons, nor yet when summoned playing the coward: but
ready for everything, and noble, and full of all boldness of
speech.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xix-p34">But let us hear also what they say, that from
this also we may learn their<note place="end" n="86" id="iv.xix-p34.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xix-p35">

lofty spirit. (<scripRef passage="Dan. iii. 17" id="iv.xix-p35.4" parsed="|Dan|3|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Dan.3.17">Dan. iii. 17</scripRef>.) “There is a God in heaven
able to deliver us:” they take no care for themselves, but even
when about to be burned the glory of God is all their thought.
For what they say comes to this, “Lest perchance if we are burnt
thou shouldest charge God with weakness, we now declare unto thee
accurately our whole doctrine. “There is a God in heaven,”
not such as this image here on earth, this lifeless and mute thing,
but able to snatch even from the midst of the burning fiery
furnace. Condemn him not then of weakness for permitting us to
fall into it. So powerful is He that after our fall, He is able
to snatch us out again out of the flame. “But if not, be it
known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor
worship the golden image which thou hast set up.” Observe that
they by a special dispensation are ignorant of the future: for if
they had foreknown, there would have been nothing wonderful in
their doing what they did. For what marvel is it if when they had
a guarantee for safety, they defied all terrors? Then God indeed
would have been glorified in that He was able to deliver from the
furnace: but they would not have been wondered at, inasmuch as
they would not have cast themselves into any dangers. For this
cause He suffered them to be ignorant of the future that He might
glorify them the more. And as they cautioned (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xix-p35.5">ἠσψαλίξοντο</span>) the king that he was not to condemn
God of weakness though they might be burnt, so God accomplished
both purposes; the shewing forth His own power and the causing the
zeal of the children to appear more conspicuous.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xix-p36">From whence then arose their doubting and their not
feeling confident that they should at all events be preserved? 
Because they esteemed themselves assuredly too mean, and unworthy
of such a benefit. And to prove that I say not this upon
conjecture; when they fell into the furnace, they bewailed
themselves after this sort, saying, (<scripRef passage="Song of the Three Children 6,10" id="iv.xix-p36.1">Song of the
three Children vv. 6, 10</scripRef>.) “We have sinned, we have
done iniquity, we cannot open our mouth.” And therefore they
said, “But if not.” But if they did not plainly say this,
namely, “God is able to deliver us; but if he deliver us not, for
our sin’s sake He will not deliver us;” wonder not at it. For
they would have seemed to the barbarians to be sheltering the
weakness of God under the pretext of their own sins. Wherefore
His power only is what they speak of: the reason they allege
not. And besides, they were well disciplined not to be
over-curious about the judgments of God.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xix-p37">With these words then, they entered into the
fire; and they neither cast insult upon the king, nor overturned
the statue<note place="end" n="87" id="iv.xix-p37.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xix-p38">
This may be a covert allusion to the outrage on the statues of
Theodosius, which had brought Antioch into so great trouble in the
second year of S. Chrysostom’s ministry there.</p></note>. For such
should the courageous man be, temperate and mild; and that
especially in dangers; that he may not seem to go forth to such
contests in wrath and vain-glory; but with fortitude and
self-possession. For whoso deals insolently undergoes the
suspicion of those faults: but he that endures, and is forced
into the struggle, and goes through the trial with meekness, is not
only admired as brave, but his self-possession also and
consideration cause him to be no less extolled. And this is what
they did at that time; shewing forth all fortitude and gentleness,
and doing nothing for reward nor for recompense or return.  
“‘Though He be not willing ‘so it stands’ to deliver us, we
will not serve thy gods:’ for we have already our recompense in
that we are counted worthy to be kept from all impiety, and for
that end to give our bodies to be burned.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xix-p39">We then also having already our recompense, (for
indeed we have it in that we have been vouchsafed the full
knowledge of Him, vouch-safed to be made members of Christ,) let us
take care that we make them not members of an harlot. For with
this most tremendous saying we must conclude our discourse, in
order that having the fear of the threat in full efficacy, we may
remain purer than gold, this fear helping to make us so. For so
shall we be able, delivered from all fornication, to see Christ.
Whom God grant us all to behold with boldness at that day, through
the grace and loving-kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ; to Whom be
the glory, for evermore. Amen.</p>

<p class="c27" id="iv.xx-p3">Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote to me: 
it is good for a man not to touch a woman. But because of
fornications, let each man have his own wife; and let each woman
have her own husband.</p>

<p class="c24" id="iv.xx-p4"><span class="c18" id="iv.xx-p4.1">Having</span> corrected the three
heaviest things laid to their charge, one, the distraction of the
Church, another, about the fornicator, a third, about the covetous
person, he thenceforth uses a milder sort of speech. And he
interposes some exhortation and advice about marriage and
virginity, giving the hearers some respite from more unpleasant
subjects. But in the second Epistle he does the contrary; he
begins from the milder topics, and ends with the more
distressing. And here also, after he has finished his discourse
about virginity, he again launches forth into matter more akin to
reproof; not setting all down in regular order, but varying his
discourse in either kind, as the occasion required and the exigency
of the matters in hand.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xx-p5">Wherefore he says, “Now concerning the things
whereof ye wrote unto me.” For they had written to him,
“Whether it was right to abstain from one’s wife, or not:”
and writing back in answer to this and giving rules about marriage,
he introduces also the discourse concerning virginity: “It is
good for a man not to touch a woman.” “For if,” says he,
“thou enquire what is the excellent and greatly superior course,
it is better not to have any connection whatever with a woman: 
but if you ask what is safe and helpful to thine own infirmity, be
connected by marriage.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xx-p6">But since it was likely, as also happens now, that
the husband might be willing but the wife not, or perhaps the
reverse, mark how he discusses each case. Some indeed say that
this discourse was addressed by him to priests. But I, judging
from what follows, could not affirm that it was so: since he
would not have given his advice in general terms. For if he were
writing these things only for the priests, he would have said,
“It is good for the teacher not to touch a woman.” But now he
has made it of universal application, saying, “It is good for a
man;” not for priest only. And again, “Art thou loosed from a
wife? Seek not a wife.” He said not, “You who are a priest
and teacher,” but indefinitely. And the whole of his speech
goes on entirely in the same tones. And in saying, “Because of
fornications, let every man have his own wife” by the very cause
alleged for the concession he guides men to continence.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xx-p7">[2.] <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 7.3" id="iv.xx-p7.1" parsed="|1Cor|7|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.7.3">Ver. 3</scripRef>. “Let the husband
pay the wife the honor<note place="end" n="88" id="iv.xx-p7.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xx-p8">
<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xx-p8.1">τιμὴν</span>: rec. text. <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xx-p8.2"> εὐνοίαν</span>. [The latest editors adopt the reading <span class="Greek" id="iv.xx-p8.3">̓ὀφειλην</span>. C.]</p></note>
due to her: in like manner the wife the husband.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xx-p9">Now what is the meaning of “the due honor? The
wife hath not power over her own body;” but is both the slave and
the mistress of the husband. And if you decline the service which
is due, you have offended God. But if thou wish to withdraw
thyself, it must be with the husband’s permission, though it be
but a for short time. For this is why he calls the matter a debt,
to shew that no one is master of himself but that they are servants
to each other.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xx-p10">When therefore thou seest an harlot tempting thee,
say, “My body is not mine, but my wife’s.” The same also
let the woman say to those who would undermine her chastity, “My
body is not mine, but my husband’s.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xx-p11">Now if neither husband nor wife hath power even over
their own body, much less have they over their property. Hear ye,
all that have husbands and all that have wives: that if you must
not count your body your own, much less your money.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xx-p12">Elsewhere I grant He gives to the husband abundant
precedence, both in the New Testament, and the Old saying, (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xx-p12.1">ἡ ἀποστρόφή σου</span>, LXX. <scripRef version="LXX" passage="Gen. iii. 16" id="iv.xx-p12.2" parsed="lxx|Gen|3|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible.lxx:Gen.3.16">Gen. iii. 16</scripRef>.) “Thy turning shall be
towards thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.” Paul doth so
too by making a distinction thus, and writing, (<scripRef passage="Ephes. v. 25, 33" id="iv.xx-p12.3" parsed="|Eph|5|25|0|0;|Eph|5|33|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Eph.5.25 Bible:Eph.5.33">Ephes. v. 25, 33</scripRef>.) “Husbands, love your
wives; and let the wife see that she reverence her husband.”
But in this place we hear no more of greater and less, but it is
one and the same right. Now why is this? Because his speech was
about chastity. “In all other things,” says he, “let the
husband have the prerogative; but not so where the question is
about chastity.” “The husband hath no power over his own
body, neither the wife.” There is great equality of honor, and
no prerogative.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xx-p13"><pb n="106" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_106.html" id="iv.xx-Page_106" />[3.] <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 7.5" id="iv.xx-p13.1" parsed="|1Cor|7|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.7.5">Ver. 5</scripRef>. “Defraud ye not one the
other, except it be by consent.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xx-p14">What then can this mean? “Let not the wife,”
says he, “exercise continence, if the husband be unwilling; nor
yet the husband without the wife’s consent.” Why so? 
Because great evils spring from this sort of continence. For
adulteries and fornications and the ruin of families have often
arisen from hence. For if when men have their own wives they
commit fornication, much more if you defraud them of this
consolation. And well says he, “Defraud not; fraud” here, and
“debt” above, that he might shew the strictness of the right of
dominion in question. For that one should practice continence
against the will of the other is “defrauding;” but not so, with
the other’s consent: any more than I count myself defrauded, if
after persuading me you take away any thing of mine. Since only
he defrauds who takes against another’s will and by force. A
thing which many women do, working sin rather than righteousness,
and thereby becoming accountable for the husband’s uncleanness,
and rending all asunder. Whereas they should value concord above
all things, since this is more important than all beside.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xx-p15">We will, if you please, consider it with a view to
actual cases. Thus, suppose a wife and husband, and let the wife
be continent, without consent of her husband; well then, if
hereupon he commit fornication, or though abstaining from
fornication fret and grow restless and be heated and quarrel and
give all kind of trouble to his wife; where is all the gain of the
fasting and the continence, a breach being made in love? There is
none. For what strange reproaches, how much trouble, how great a
war must of course arise! since when in an house man and wife are
at variance, the house will be no better off than a ship in a storm
when the master is upon ill terms with the man at the head.
Wherefore he saith, “Defraud not one another, unless it be by
consent for a season, that ye may give yourselves unto prayer.”
It is prayer with unusual earnestness which he here means. For if
he is forbidding those who have intercourse with one another to
pray, how could “pray without ceasing” have any place? It is
possible then to live with a wife and yet give heed unto prayer.
But by continence prayer is made more perfect. For he did not say
merely, “That ye may pray;” but, “That ye may give yourselves
unto it;” as though what he speaks of might cause not uncleanness
but much occupation.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xx-p16">“And may be together again, that Satan tempt you
not.” Thus lest it should seem to be a matter of express
enactment, he adds the reason. And what is it? “That Satan
tempt you not.” And that you may understand that it is not the
devil only who causeth this crime, I mean adultery, he adds,
“because of your incontinency.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xx-p17">“But this I say by way of permission, not of
commandment. For I would that all men were even as I myself; in a
state of continence.” This he doth in many places when he is
advising about difficult matters; he brings forward himself, and
says, “Be ye imitators of me.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xx-p18">“Howbeit each man hath his own gift from God, one
after this manner, and another after that.” Thus since he had
heavily charged them saying, “for your incontinence,” he again
comforteth them by the words, “each one hath his own gift of
God;” not declaring that towards that virtue there is no need of
zeal on our part, but, as I was saying before, to comfort them.
For if it be a “gift,” and man contributes nothing thereunto,
how sayest thou, “But (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. 7.8" id="iv.xx-p18.1" parsed="|1Cor|7|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.7.8">v. 8</scripRef>.) I say to the unmarried and
to widows, it is good for them if they abide even as I: (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. 7.9" id="iv.xx-p18.2" parsed="|1Cor|7|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.7.9">v. 9</scripRef>.) but if they have not
continency let them marry?” Do you see the strong sense of Paul
how he both signifies that continence is better, and yet puts no
force on the person who cannot attain to it; fearing lest some
offence arise?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xx-p19">“For it is better to marry than to burn.” He
indicates how great is the tyranny of concupiscence. What he
means is something like this: “If you have to endure much
violence and burning desire, withdraw yourself from your pains and
toils, lest haply you be subverted.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xx-p20">[4.] <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 7.10" id="iv.xx-p20.1" parsed="|1Cor|7|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.7.10">Ver. 10</scripRef>. “But to the married I
give charge, yet not I, but the Lord.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xx-p21">Because it is a law expressly appointed by Christ
which he is about to read to them about the “not putting away a
wife without fornication; “(S. <scripRef passage="Matt. 5.32; 19.9; Mark 10.11; Luke 16.18" id="iv.xx-p21.1" parsed="|Matt|5|32|0|0;|Matt|19|9|0|0;|Mark|10|11|0|0;|Luke|16|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.32 Bible:Matt.19.9 Bible:Mark.10.11 Bible:Luke.16.18">Matt.
v. 32., xix. 9; S. Mark x. 11; S. Luke xvi. 18</scripRef>.) therefore he says, “Not
I.” True it is what was before spoken though it were not
expressly stated, yet it also is His decree. But this, you see,
He had delivered in express words. So that the words “I and not
I” have this difference of meaning. For that you might not
imagine even his own words to be human, therefore he added, “For
I think that I also have the Spirit of God.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xx-p22">Now what is that which “to the married the Lord
commanded? That the wife depart not from her husband: (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. 7.11" id="iv.xx-p22.1" parsed="|1Cor|7|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.7.11">v. 11</scripRef>.) but if she depart, let her
remain unmarried, or be reconciled unto her husband.” Here,
seeing that both on the score of continence and other pretexts, and
because of infirmities of temper, (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xx-p22.2">μικροψυχίας</span>.) it fell out that separations took
place: it were <pb n="107" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_107.html" id="iv.xx-Page_107" />better, he
says, that such things should not be at all; but however if they
take place, let the wife remain with her husband, if not to cohabit
with him, yet so as not to introduce any other to be her
husband.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xx-p23"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 7.12" id="iv.xx-p23.1" parsed="|1Cor|7|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.7.12">Ver. 12</scripRef>. “But to the rest speak I,
not the Lord. If any brother have a wife that believeth not, and
she is content to dwell with him, let him not leave her. And if
any woman hath an husband that believeth not, and he is content to
dwell with her, let her not leave him.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xx-p24">For as when discoursing about separating from
fornicators, he made the matter easy by the correction which he
applied to his words, saying, “Howbeit, not altogether with the
fornicators of this world;” so also in this case he provideth for
the abundant easiness of the duty, saying, “If any wife have a
husband, or husband a wife, that believeth not, let him not leave
her.” What sayest thou? “If he be an unbeliever, let him
remain with the wife, but not if he be a fornicator? And yet
fornication is a less sin than unbelief.” I grant, fornication
is a less sin: but God spares thine infirmities extremely. And
this is what He doth about the sacrifice, saying, (S. <scripRef passage="Matt. v. 24" id="iv.xx-p24.1" parsed="|Matt|5|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.24">Matt. v. 24</scripRef>.) “Leave the sacrifice, and
be reconciled to thy brother.” This also in the case of the man
who owed ten thousand talents. For him too He did not punish for
owing him ten thousand talents, but for demanding back a hundred
pence from his fellow-servant He took vengeance on him.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xx-p25">Then lest the woman might fear, as though she became
unclean because of intercourse with her husband, he says, “For
the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife, and the
unbelieving wife is sanctified in the husband.” And yet, if
“he that is joined to an harlot is one body,” it is quite clear
that the woman also who is joined to an idolater is one body.
Well: it is one body; nevertheless she becomes not unclean, but
the cleanness of the wife overcomes the uncleanness of the husband;
and again, the cleanness of the believing husband overcomes the
uncleanness of the unbelieving wife.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xx-p26">How then in this case is the uncleanness overcome,
and therefore the intercourse allowed; while in the woman who
prostitutes herself, the husband is not condemned in casting her
out? Because here there is hope that the lost member may be saved
through the marriage; but in the other case the marriage has
already been dissolved; and there again both are corrupted; but
here the fault is in one only of the two. I mean something like
this: she that has been guilty of fornication is utterly
abominable: if then “he that is joined to an harlot is one
body,” he also becomes abominable by having connection with an
harlot; wherefore all the purity flits away. But in the case
before us it is not so. But how? The idolater is unclean but
the woman is not unclean. For if indeed she were a partner with
him in that wherein he is unclean, I mean his impiety, she herself
would also become unclean. But now the idolater is unclean in one
way, and the wife holds communion with him in another wherein he is
not unclean. For marriage and mixture of bodies is that wherein
the communion consists.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xx-p27">Again, there is a hope that this man may be
reclaimed by his wife for she is made completely his own: but for
the other it is not very easy. For how will she who dishonored
him in former times and became another’s and destroyed the rights
of marriage, have power to reclaim him whom she had wronged; him,
moreover, who still remains to her as an alien?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xx-p28">Again in that case, after the fornication the
husband is not a husband: but here, although the wife be an
idolatress, the husband’s rights are not destroyed.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xx-p29">However, he doth not simply recommend cohabitation
with the unbeliever, but with the qualification that he wills it.
Wherefore he said, “And he himself be content to dwell with
her.” For, tell me, what harm is there when the duties of piety
remain unimpaired and there are good hopes about the unbeliever,
that those already joined should so abide and not bring in
occasions of unnecessary warfare? For the question now is not
about those who have never yet come together, but about those who
are already joined. He did not say, If any one wish to take an
unbelieving wife, but, “If any one hath an unbelieving wife.”
Which means, If any after marrying or being married have received
the word of godliness, and then the other party which had continued
in unbelief still yearn for them to dwell together, let not the
marriage be broken off. “For,” saith he, “the unbelieving
husband is sanctified in the wife.” So great is the
superabundance of thy purity.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xx-p30">What then, is the Greek holy? Certainly not: for
he said not, He is holy; but, “He is sanctified in his wife.”
And this he said, not to signify that he is holy, but to deliver
the woman as completely as possible from her fear and lead the man
to desire the truth. For the uncleanness is not in the bodies
wherein there is communion, but in the mind and the thoughts. And
here follows the proof; namely, that if thou continuing unclean
have offspring, the child, not being of thee alone, is of course
unclean or half clean. But now it is not unclean. To which
effect he adds, “else were your children unclean; but now are
they holy;” <pb n="108" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_108.html" id="iv.xx-Page_108" />that is, not
unclean. But the Apostle calls them, “holy,” by the intensity
of the expression again casting out the dread arising from that
sort of suspicion.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xx-p31"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 7.15" id="iv.xx-p31.1" parsed="|1Cor|7|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.7.15">Ver. 15</scripRef>. “Yet if the unbelieving
departeth, let him depart,” for in this case the matter is no
longer fornication. But what is the meaning of, “if the
unbelieving departeth?” For instance, if he bid thee sacrifice
and take part in his ungodliness on account of thy marriage, or
else part company; it were better the marriage were annulled, and
no breach made in godliness. Wherefore he adds, “A brother is
not under bondage, nor yet a sister, in such cases.” If day by
day he buffet thee and keep up combats on this account, it is
better to separate. For this is what he glances at, saying,
“But God hath called us in peace.” For it is the other party
who furnished the ground of separation, even as he did who
committed uncleanness.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xx-p32"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 7.16" id="iv.xx-p32.1" parsed="|1Cor|7|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.7.16">Ver. 16</scripRef>. “For how knowest thou, O
wife, whether thou shalt save thine husband?” This again refers
to that expression, “let her not leave him.” That is, “if
he makes no disturbance, remain,” saith he, “for there is even
profit in this; remain and advise and give counsel and
persuade.” For no teacher will have such power to prevail (Reg.
<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xx-p32.2">πεῖσαι</span>. Bened. <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xx-p32.3">ἰσχὺσαι</span>.<note place="end" n="89" id="iv.xx-p32.4"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xx-p33">
[The latter is adopted by Field.]</p></note>) as a wife. And neither, on one
hand, doth he lay any necessity upon her and absolutely demand the
point of her, that he may not again do what would be too painful;
nor, on the other, doth he tell her to despair: but he leaves the
matter in suspense through the uncertainty of the future, saying,
“For how knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy
husband? or how knowest thou, O husband whether thou shalt save thy
wife?”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xx-p34">[5.] And again, <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 7.17" id="iv.xx-p34.1" parsed="|1Cor|7|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.7.17">ver. 17</scripRef>. “Only as God hath
distributed to each man, as the Lord hath called each, so let him
walk. Was any one called being circumcised? let him not become
uncircumcised. Was any called in uncircumcision? let him not be
circumcised. Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is
nothing; but the keeping of the commandments of God. Let each man
abide in that calling wherein he was called. Wast thou called,
being a slave? Care not for it.” These things contribute
nothing unto faith, saith he. Be not then contentious neither be
troubled; for the faith hath cast out all these things.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xx-p35">“Let each man abide in that calling wherein he was
called. Hast thou been called, having an unbelieving wife? 
Continue to have her. Cast not out thy wife for the faith’s
sake. Hast thou been called, being a slave? Care not for it.
Continue to be a slave. Hast thou been called, being in
uncircumcision? Remain uncircumcised. Being circumcised, didst
thou become a believer? Continue circumcised. For this is the
meaning of, “As God hath distributed unto each man.” For
these are no hindrances to piety. Thou art called, being a slave;
another, with an unbelieving wife; another, being circumcised.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xx-p36">Astonishing! where has he put slavery? As
circumcision profits not: and uncircumcision does no harm; so
neither doth slavery, nor yet liberty. And that he might point
out this with surpassing clearness, he says, “But even (<span class="Greek" id="iv.xx-p36.1">Αλλ' εὶ καὶ</span> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xx-p36.2"> δυνάσαι</span>) if thou canst become free, use it rather:”
that is, rather continue a slave. Now upon what possible ground
does he tell the person who might be set free to remain a slave? 
He means to point out that slavery is no harm but rather an
advantage.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xx-p37">Now we are not ignorant that some say, the
words, “use it rather,” are spoken with regard to liberty: 
interpreting it, “if thou canst become free, become free.”<note place="end" n="90" id="iv.xx-p37.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xx-p38">
[This is the view of Calvin, Neander, Hoffmann, etc., but Bengel,
De Wette, Meyer, Alford, Stanley, Principal Edwards agree with
Chrysostom. The question is a very nice one. C.]</p></note>  But the expression would be very
contrary to Paul’s manner if he intended this. For he would
not, when consoling the slave and signifying that he was in no
respect injured, have told him to get free. Since perhaps some
one might say, “What then, if I am not able? I am an injured
and degraded person.” This then is not what he says: but as I
said, meaning to point out that a man gets nothing by being made
free, he says, “Though thou hast it in thy power to be made free,
remain rather in slavery.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xx-p39">Next he adds also the cause; “For he that was
called in the Lord being a bondservant, is the Lord’s free man: 
likewise he that was called, being free, is Christ’s
bondservant.” “For,” saith he, “in the things that relate
to Christ, both are equal: and like as thou art the slave of
Christ, so also is thy master. How then is the slave a free
man? Because He has freed thee not only from sin, but also from
outward slavery while continuing a slave. For he suffers not the
slave to be a slave, not even though he be a man abiding in
slavery: and this is the great wonder.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xx-p40">But how is the slave a free man while continuing a
slave? When he is freed from passions and the diseases of the
mind: when he looks down upon riches and wrath and all other the
like passions.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xx-p41"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 7.23" id="iv.xx-p41.1" parsed="|1Cor|7|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.7.23">Ver. 23</scripRef>. “Ye were bought with a
price: become not bondservants of men.” This saying is
addressed not to slaves only but also to free men. For it is
possible for one who is a slave not to be a slave; and for one who
is a freeman to be <pb n="109" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_109.html" id="iv.xx-Page_109" />a slave.
“And how can one be a slave and not a slave?” When he doeth
all for God: when he feigns nothing, and doeth nothing out of
eye-service towards men: that is how one that is a slave to men
can be free. Or again, how doth one that is free become a
slave? When he serves men in any evil service, either for
gluttony or desire of wealth or for office’ sake. For such an
one, though he be free, is more of a slave than any man.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xx-p42">And consider both these points. Joseph was a slave
but not a slave to men: wherefore even in slavery he was freer
than all that are free. For instance, he yielded not to his
mistress; yielded not to the purposes which she who possessed him
desired. Again she was free; yet none ever so like a slave,
courting and beseeching her own servant. But she prevailed not on
him, who was free, to do what he would not. This then was not
slavery; but it was liberty of the most exalted kind. For what
impediment to virtue had he from his slavery? Let men hear, both
slaves and free. Which was the slave? He that was entreated or
she that did entreat? She that besought or he that despised her
supplication?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xx-p43">In fact, there are limits set to slaves by God
Himself; and up to what point one ought to keep them, has also been
determined, and to transgress them is wrong. Namely, when your
master commands nothing which is unpleasing to God, it is right to
follow and to obey; but no farther. For thus the slave becomes
free. But if you go further, even though you are free you are
become a slave. At least he intimates this, saying, “Be not ye
the servants of men.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xx-p44">But if this be not the meaning, if he bade them
forsake their masters and strive contentiously to become free, in
what sense did he exhort them, saying, “Let each one remain in
the calling in which he is called?” And in another place,
(<scripRef passage="1 Tim. vi. 1, 2" id="iv.xx-p44.1" parsed="|1Tim|6|1|6|2" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.6.1-1Tim.6.2">1 Tim. vi. 1, 2</scripRef>.) “As many servants as are
under the yoke, let them count their own masters worthy of all
honor; and those that have believing masters, let them not despise
them, because they are brethren who partake of the benefit.”
And writing to the Ephesians also and to the Colossians, he ordains
and exacts the same rules. Whence it is plain that it is not this
slavery which he annuls, but that which caused as it is by vice
befalls free men also: and this is the worst kind of slavery,
though he be a free man who is in bondage to it. For what profit
had Joseph’s brethren of their freedom? Were they not more
servile than all slaves; both speaking lies to their father, and to
the merchants using false pretences, as well as to their brother? 
But not such was the free man: rather every where and in all
things he was true. And nothing had power to enslave him, neither
chain nor bondage nor the love of his mistress nor his being in a
strange land. But he abode free every where. For this is
liberty in the truest sense when even in bondage it shines
through.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xx-p45">[6.] Such a thing is Christianity; in slavery it
bestows freedom. And as that which is by nature an invulnerable
body then shews itself to be invulnerable when having received a
dart it suffers no harm; so also he that is strictly free then
shows himself, when even under masters he is not enslaved. For
this cause his bidding is, “remain a slave.” But if it is
impossible for one who is a slave to be a Christian such as he
ought to be, the Greeks will condemn true religion of great
weakness: whereas if they can be taught that slavery in no way
impairs godliness, they will admire our doctrine. For if death
hurt us not, nor scourges, nor chains, much less slavery. Fire
and iron and tyrannies innumerable and diseases and poverty and
wild beasts and countless things more dreadful than these, have not
been able to injure the faithful; nay, they have made them even
mightier. And how shall slavery be able to hurt? It is not
slavery itself, beloved, that hurts; but the real slavery is that
of sin. And if thou be not a slave in this sense, be bold and
rejoice. No one shall have power to do thee any wrong, having the
temper which cannot be enslaved. But if thou be a slave to sin,
even though thou be ten thousand times free thou hast no good of
thy freedom.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xx-p46">For, tell me, what profit is it when, though not in
bondage to a man, thou liest down in subjection to thy passions? 
Since men indeed often know how to spare; but those masters are
never satiated with thy destruction. Art thou in bondage to a
man? Why, thy master also is slave to thee, in arranging about
thy food, in taking care of thy health and in looking after thy
shoes and all the other things. And thou dost not fear so much
less thou shouldest offend thy master, as he fears lest any of
those necessaries should fail thee. “But he sits down, while
thou standest.” And what of that? Since this may be said of
thee as well as of him. Often, at least, when thou art lying down
and sleeping sweetly, he is not only standing, but undergoing
endless discomforts in the market-place; and he lies awake more
painfully than thou.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xx-p47">For instance; what did Joseph suffer from his
mistress to be compared with what she suffered from her evil
desire? For he indeed did not the things which she wished to put
upon him; but she performed every thing which her mistress ordered
her, I mean her spirit of unchastity: which left not off until it
had put her to open shame. What master com<pb n="110" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_110.html" id="iv.xx-Page_110" />mands such things? what savage
tyrant? “Intreat thy slave,” that is the word: “flatter
the person bought with thy money, supplicate the captive; even if
he reject thee with disgust, again besiege him: even if thou
speakest to him oftentimes, and he consent not, watch for his being
alone, and force him, and become an object of derision.” What
can be more dishonorable, what more shameful, than these words? 
“And if even by these means you make no progress, why, accuse him
falsely and deceive your husband.” Mark how mean, how shameful
are the commands, how unmerciful and savage and frantic. What
command does the master ever lay on his slave, such as those which
her wantonness then laid upon that royal woman? And yet she dare
not disobey. But Joseph underwent nothing of this sort, but every
thing on the contrary which brought glory and honor.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xx-p48">Would you like to see yet another man under severe
orders from a hard mistress, and without spirit to disobey any of
them? Consider Cain, what commands were laid on him by his
envy. She ordered him to slay his brother, to lie unto God, to
grieve his father, to cast off shame; and he did it all, and in
nothing refused to obey. And why marvel that over a single person
so great should be the power of this mistress? She hath often
destroyed entire nations. For instance, the Midianitish women
took the Jews, and all but bound them in captivity; their own
beauty kindling desire, was the means of their vanquishing that
whole nation. Paul then to cast out this sort of slavery, said,
“Become not servants of men;” that is, “Obey not men
commanding unreasonable things: nay, obey not yourselves.”
Then having raised up their mind and made it mount on high, he
says,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xx-p49">[7.] <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 7.25" id="iv.xx-p49.1" parsed="|1Cor|7|25|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.7.25">Ver. 25</scripRef>. “Now concerning
virgins. I have no commandment of the Lord; but I give my
judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be
faithful.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xx-p50">Advancing on his way in regular order, he proceeds
next to speak concerning virginity. For after that he had
exercised and trained them, in his words concerning continence, he
goes forth towards what is greater, saying, “I have no
commandment, but I esteem it to be good.” For what reason? 
For the self-same reason as he had mentioned respecting
continence.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xx-p51"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 7.27" id="iv.xx-p51.1" parsed="|1Cor|7|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.7.27">Ver. 27</scripRef>. “Art thou bound unto a
wife? Seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? 
Seek not a wife.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xx-p52">These words carry no contradiction to what had been
said before but rather the most entire agreement with them. For
he says in that place also, “Except it be by consent:” as
here he says, “Art thou bound unto a wife? Seek not
separation.” This is no contradiction. For its being against
consent makes a dissolution: but if with consent both live
continently, it is no dissolution.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xx-p53">Then, lest this should seem to be laying down a law,
he subjoins, (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. 7.28" id="iv.xx-p53.1" parsed="|1Cor|7|28|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.7.28">v. 28</scripRef>.)
“but if thou marry, thou hast not sinned.” He next alleges
the existing state of things, “the present distress, the
shortness of the time,” and “the affliction.” For marriage
draws along with it many things, which indeed he hath glanced at,
as well here as also in the discourse about continence: there, by
saying, “the wife hath not power over herself;” and here, by
the expression, “Thou art bound.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xx-p54">“But if and thou marry, thou hast not
sinned.” He is not speaking about her who hath made choice of
virginity, for if it comes to that, she hath sinned. Since if the
widows<note place="end" n="91" id="iv.xx-p54.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xx-p55">
i.e. the widows whom St. Paul mentions, 
<scripRef passage="1 Tim. v. 11, 12" id="iv.xx-p55.1" parsed="|1Tim|5|11|5|12" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.5.11-1Tim.5.12">1 Tim. v. 11, 12</scripRef>.</p></note> are condemned
for having to do with second marriages after they have once chosen
widowhood, much more the virgins.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xx-p56"> “But such shall have trouble in the flesh.”
“And pleasure too,” you will say: but observe how he curtails
this by the shortness of the time, saying, (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. 7.28" id="iv.xx-p56.1" parsed="|1Cor|7|28|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.7.28">v. 28</scripRef>.) “the time is shortened;”
that is, “we are exhorted to depart now and go forth, but thou
art running further in.” And yet even although marriage had no
troubles, even so we ought to press on towards things to come.
But when it hath affliction too, what need to draw on one’s self
an additional burden. What occasion to take up such a load, when
even after taking it you must use it as having it not? For
“those even that have wives must be,” he saith, “as though
they had none.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xx-p57">Then, having interposed something about the future,
he brings back his speech to the present. For some of his topics
are spiritual; as that, “the one careth about the things which be
her husband’s, the other about those which be God’s.”
Others relate to this present life; as, “I would have you to be
free from cares.” But still with all this he leaves it to their
own choice: inasmuch as he who after proving what is best goes
back to compulsion, seems as if he did not trust his own
statements. Wherefore he rather attracts them by concession, and
checks them as follows:</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xx-p58"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 7.35" id="iv.xx-p58.1" parsed="|1Cor|7|35|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.7.35">Ver. 35</scripRef>. “And this I say for your
own profit, not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that
which is seemly, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without
distraction. Let the virgins hear that not by that one point is
virginity defined; for she that is careful about the things of the
world cannot be a virgin, nor seemly. Thus, when he said,
“There is difference between a wife and a virgin,” he added
this as the difference, and that wherein they are distinguished
from each other. And laying down 
<pb n="111" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_111.html" id="iv.xx-Page_111" />the definition of a virgin and her that is not a
virgin, he names, not marriage nor continence but leisure from
engagements and multiplicity of engagements. For the evil is not
in the cohabitation, but in the impediment to the strictness of
life.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xx-p59"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 7.36" id="iv.xx-p59.1" parsed="|1Cor|7|36|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.7.36">Ver. 36</scripRef>. “But if any man think
that he behaveth himself unseemly toward his virgin.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xx-p60">Here he seems to be talking about marriage; but all
that he says relates to virginity; for he allows even a second
marriage, saying, “only in the Lord.” Now what means, “in
the Lord?” With chastity, with honor: for this is needed
every where, and must be pursued for else we cannot see God.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xx-p61">Now if we have passed lightly by what he says of
virginity, let no one accuse us of negligence; for indeed an entire
book hath been composed by us upon this topic and as we have there
with all the accuracy which we could, gone through every branch of
the subject, we considered it a waste of words to introduce it
again here. Wherefore, referring the hearer to that work as
concerns these things, we will say this one thing here: We must
follow after continence. For, saith he, “follow after peace,
and the sanctification without which no one shall see the
Lord.” Therefore that we may be accounted worthy to see Him,
whether we be in virginity or in the first marriage or the second,
let us follow after this that we may obtain the kingdom of heaven,
through the grace and loving-kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ; to
Whom with the Father and the Holy Spirit, be glory, power, honor,
now, henceforth, and for everlasting ages. Amen.</p>

<p class="c27" id="iv.xxi-p3">Now concerning things sacrificed to idols: we know

edifieth.</p>

<p class="c24" id="iv.xxi-p4"><span class="c18" id="iv.xxi-p4.1">It</span> is necessary first to
say what the meaning of this passage is: for so shall we readily
comprehend the Apostle’s discourse. For he that sees a charge
brought against any one, except he first perceive the nature of the
offence will not understand what is said. What then is it of
which he was then accusing the Corinthians? A heavy charge and
the cause of many evils. Well, what is it? Many among them,
having learnt that (St. 
<scripRef passage="Matt. xv. 11" id="iv.xxi-p4.2" parsed="|Matt|15|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.15.11">Matt. xv. 11</scripRef>.) “not the things which
enter in defile the man, but the things which proceed out,” and
that idols of wood and stone, and demons, have no power to hurt or
help, had made an immoderate use of their perfect knowledge of this
to the harm both of others and of themselves. They had both gone
in where idols were and had partaken of the tables there, and were
producing thereby great and ruinous evil. For, on the one hand,
those who still retained the fear of idols and knew not how to
contemn them, took part in those meals, because they saw the more
perfect sort doing this; and hence they got the greatest injury: 
since they did not touch what was set before them with the same
mind as the others, but as things offered in sacrifice to idols;
and the thing was becoming a way to idolatry. On the other hand,
these very persons who pretended to be more perfect were injured in
no common way, partaking in the tables of demons.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxi-p5">This then was the subject of complaint. Now this
blessed man being about to correct it, did not immediately begin to
speak vehemently; for that which was done came more of folly than
of wickedness: wherefore in the first instance there was need
rather of exhortation than of severe rebuke and wrath. Now herein
observe his good sense, how he immediately begins to admonish.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxi-p6"> “Now concerning things sacrificed to idols, we
know that we all have knowledge.” Leaving alone the weak, which
he always doth, he discourses with the strong first. And this is
what he did also in the Epistle to the Romans, saying, (<scripRef passage="Rom. xiv. 10" id="iv.xxi-p6.1" parsed="|Rom|14|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.14.10">Rom. xiv. 10</scripRef>.) “But thou, why dost thou
judge thy brother?” for this is the sort of person that is able
to receive rebuke also with readiness. Exactly the same then he
doth here also.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxi-p7">And first he makes void their conceit by declaring
that this very thing which they considered as peculiar to
themselves, the having perfect knowledge, was common to all.
Thus, “we know,” saith he, “that we all have knowledge.”
For if allowing them to have high thoughts, he had first pointed
out how hurtful the thing was to others, he would not have done
them so much good as harm. For the ambitious soul when it plumes
itself upon any thing, <pb n="112" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_112.html" id="iv.xxi-Page_112" />even
though the same do harm to others, yet strongly adheres to it
because of the tyranny of vain-glory. Wherefore Paul first
examines the matter itself by itself: just as he had done before
in the case of the wisdom from without, demolishing it with a high
hand. But in that case he did it as we might have expected: for
the whole thing was altogether blameworthy and his task was very
easy. Wherefore he signifies it to be not only useless, but even
contrary to the Gospel. But in the present case it was not
possible to do this. For what was done was of knowledge, and
perfect knowledge. Nor was it safe to overthrow it, and yet in no
other way was it possible to cast out the conceit which had
resulted from it. What then doeth he? First, by signifying that
it was common, he curbs that swelling pride of theirs. For they
who possess something great and excellent are more elated, when
they alone have it; but if it be made out that they possess it in
common with others, they no longer have so much of this feeling.
First then he makes it common property, because they considered it
to belong to themselves alone.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxi-p8">Next, having made it common, he does not make
himself singly a sharer in it with them; for in this way too he
would have rather set them up; for as to be the only possessor
elates, so to have one partner or two perhaps among leading persons
has this effect just as much. For this reason he does not mention
himself but all: he said not, “I too have knowledge,” but,
“we know that we all have knowledge.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxi-p9">[2.] This then is one way, and the first, by which
he cast down their pride; the next hath greater force. What then
is this? In that he shews that not even this thing itself was in
all points complete, but imperfect, and extremely so. And not
only imperfect, but also injurious, unless there were another thing
joined together with it. For having said that “we have
knowledge,” he added, “Knowledge puffeth up, but love
edifieth:” so that when it is without love, it lifts men up to
absolute arrogance.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxi-p10">“And yet not even love,” you will say,
“without knowledge hath any advantage.” Well: this he did
not say; but omitting it as a thing allowed by all, he signifies
that knowledge stands in extreme need of love. For he who loves,
inasmuch as he fulfils the commandment which is most absolute of
all, even though he have some defects, will quickly be blest with
knowledge because of his love; as Cornelius and many others. But
he that hath knowledge but hath not love, not only shall gain
nothing more, but shall also be cast out of that which he hath, in
many cases falling into arrogance. It seems then that knowledge
is not productive of love, but on the contrary debars from it him
that is not on his guard, puffing him up and elating him. For
arrogance is wont to cause divisions: but love both draws
together and leads to knowledge. And to make this plain he saith,
“But if any man loveth God, the same is known of Him.” So
that “I forbid not this,” saith he, “namely, your having
perfect knowledge; but your having it with love, that I enjoin;
else is it no gain, but rather loss.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxi-p11">Do you see how he already sounds the first note of
his discourse concerning love? For since all these evils were
springing from the following root, i.e., not from perfect
knowledge, but from their not greatly loving nor sparing their
neighbors; whence ensued both their variance and their
self-satisfaction, and all the rest which he had charged them with;
both before this and after he is continually providing for love; so
correcting the fountain of all good things. “Now why,” saith
he, “are ye puffed up about knowledge? For if ye have not love,
ye shall even be injured thereby. For what is worse than
boasting? But if the other be added, the first also will be in
safety. For although you may know something more than your
neighbor, if you love him you will not set yourself up but lead him
also to the same.” Wherefore also having said, “Knowledge
puffeth up,” he added, “but love edifieth.” He did not say,
“Behaveth itself modestly,” but what is much more, and more
gainful. For their knowledge was not only puffing them up but
also distracting them. On this account he opposes the one to the
other.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxi-p12">[3.] And then he adds a third consideration, which
was of force to set them down. What then is this? that although
charity be joined with it, yet not even in that case is this our
knowledge perfect. And therefore he adds,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxi-p13"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 8.2" id="iv.xxi-p13.1" parsed="|1Cor|8|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.8.2">Ver. 2</scripRef>.
“But if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth
nothing yet as he ought to know.” This is a mortal blow. “I
dwell not,” saith he, “on the knowledge being common to all.
I say not that by hating your neighbor and by arrogance, you injure
yourself most. But even though you have it by yourself alone,
though you be modest, though you love your brother, even in this
case you are imperfect in regard of knowledge. “For as yet thou
knowest nothing as thou oughtest to know,” Now if we possess as
yet exact knowledge of nothing, how is it that some have rushed on
to such a pitch of frenzy as to say that they know God with all
exactness? Whereas, though we had an exact knowledge of all other
things, not even so were it possible to possess this knowledge to
such an extent. For how far He is apart from all things, it is
impossible even to say.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxi-p14">And mark how he pulls down their swelling pride: 
for he said not, “of the matters before 
<pb n="113" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_113.html" id="iv.xxi-Page_113" />us ye have not the proper knowledge,” but,
“about every thing.” And he did not say, “ye,” but, “no
one whatever,” be it Peter, be it Paul, be it any one else. For
by this he both soothed them and carefully kept them under.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxi-p15"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 8.3" id="iv.xxi-p15.1" parsed="|1Cor|8|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.8.3">Ver. 3</scripRef>. “But if any man
love God, the same,” he doth not say, “knoweth Him,” but,
“is known of Him.” For we have not known Him, but He hath
known us. And therefore did Christ say, “Ye have not chosen Me,
but I have chosen you.” And Paul elsewhere, “Then shall I
know fully,<note place="end" n="92" id="iv.xxi-p15.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxi-p16">
<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxi-p16.1">ἐ</span><span class="Greek" id="iv.xxi-p16.2">πιγνώσομαι</span>.</p></note> even as also I
have been known.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxi-p17">Observe now, I pray, by what means he brings down
their high-mindedness. First, he points out that not they alone
knew the things which they knew; for “we all,” he saith,”
have knowledge.” Next, that the thing itself was hurtful so
long as it was without love; for “knowledge,” saith he,
“puffeth up.” Thirdly, that even joined with love it is not
complete nor perfect. “For if any man thinketh that he knoweth
any thing, he knoweth nothing as yet as he ought to know,” so he
speaks. In addition to this, that they have not even this from
themselves, but by gift from God. For he said not, “hath known
God,” but, “is known of Him.” Again, that this very thing
comes of love which they have not as they ought. For, “if any
man,” saith he, “love God, the same is known of Him.”
Having then so much at large allayed their irritation, he begins to
speak doctrinally, saying thus.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxi-p18">[4.] <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 8.4" id="iv.xxi-p18.1" parsed="|1Cor|8|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.8.4">Ver. 4</scripRef>. “Concerning
therefore the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that no
idol is anything in the world, and that there is no God but
one.” Look what a strait he hath fallen into!  For indeed his
mind is to prove both; that one ought to abstain from this kind of
banquet, and that it hath no power to hurt those who partake of
it: things which were not greatly in agreement with each other.
For when they were told that they had no harm in them, they would
naturally run to them as indifferent things. But when forbidden
to touch them, they would suspect, on the contrary, that their
having power to do hurt occasioned the prohibition. Wherefore,
you see, he puts down their opinion about idols, and then states as
a first reason for their abstaining the scandals which they place
in the way of their brethren; in these words: “Now concerning
the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that no idol is
anything in the world.” Again he makes it common property and
doth not allow this to be theirs alone, but extends the knowledge
all over the world. For “not among you alone,” says he,
“but every where on earth this doctrine prevails.” What then
is it? “That no idol is anything in the world; that there is no
God but one.” What then? are there no idols? no statues? 
Indeed there are; but they have no power: neither are they gods,
but stones and demons. For he is now setting himself against both
parties; both the grosser sort among them, and those who were
accounted lovers of wisdom. Thus, seeing that the former know of
no more than the mere stones, the others assert that certain powers
reside in them<note place="end" n="93" id="iv.xxi-p18.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxi-p19">
Olympius the Sophist, of Alexandria, A.D. 389, thus comforted the
people when their idols were destroyed: “Shapes and
counterfeits they were, fashioned of matter subject unto
corruption, therefore to grind them to dust was easy: but those
celestial powers which dwelt and resided in them are ascended to
Heaven.” Sozom. vii. 15, quoted by Hooker, E. P. v. 65. 15.</p></note>, which they
also call gods; to the former accordingly he says, that “no idol
is anything in the world,” to the other, that “there is no God
but one.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxi-p20">Do you mark how he writes these things, not simply
as laying down doctrine, but in opposition to those without? A
thing indeed which we must at all times narrowly observe, whether
he says anything abstractedly, or whether he is opposing any
persons. For this contributes in no ordinary way to the accuracy
of our doctrinal views, and to the exact understanding of his
expressions.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxi-p21">[5.] <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 8.5" id="iv.xxi-p21.1" parsed="|1Cor|8|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.8.5">Ver. 5</scripRef>. “For though there be that
are called gods, whether in heaven or on earth, as there are gods
many and lords many; yet to us there is one God, the Father, of
Whom are all things, and we unto Him; and one Lord Jesus Christ,
through Whom are all things, and we through Him.” Since he had
said, that “an idol is nothing” and that “there is no other
God;” and yet there were idols and there were those that were
called gods; that he might not seem to be contradicting plain
facts, he goes on to say, “For though there be that are called
gods, as indeed there are;” not absolutely, “there are;” but,
“called,” not in reality having this but in name: “be it in
heaven or on earth:—in heaven,” meaning the sun and the moon
and the remainder of the choir of stars; for these too the Greeks
worshipped: but upon the earth demons, and all those who had been
made gods of men:—“yet to us there is One God, the Father.”
In the first instance having expressed it without the word
“Father,” and said, “there is no God but one,” he now adds
this also, when he had utterly cast out the others.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxi-p22">Next, he adduces what indeed is the greatest token
of divinity; “of Whom are all things.” For this implies also
that those others are not gods. For it is said (<scripRef passage="Jer. x. 11" id="iv.xxi-p22.1" parsed="|Jer|10|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Jer.10.11">Jer. x. 11</scripRef>.), “Let the gods who made
not the heaven and the earth perish.” Then he subjoins what is
not less than this, “and we unto Him.” For when he saith,
“of Whom are all things,” he means the creation and the
bringing of things out of nothing into existence. But when he
saith, “and we unto Him,” he speaks of the word of faith and
mutual <pb n="114" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_114.html" id="iv.xxi-Page_114" />appropriation (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxi-p22.2">οἰκειώσεως</span>), as also he said before
(<scripRef passage="1 Cor. i. 30" id="iv.xxi-p22.3" parsed="|1Cor|1|30|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.1.30">1 Cor. i. 30</scripRef>.), “but of Him are ye also
in Christ Jesus.” In two ways we are of Him, by being made when
we were not, and by being made believers. For this also is a
creation: a thing which he also declares elsewhere; (<scripRef passage="Ephes. ii. 15" id="iv.xxi-p22.4" parsed="|Eph|2|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Eph.2.15">Ephes. ii. 15</scripRef>.) “that He might create in
Himself of the twain one new man.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxi-p23">“And there is one Lord, Jesus Christ, through Whom
are all things, and we through Him.” And in regard to Christ
again, we must conceive of this in like manner. For through Him
the race of men was both produced out of nothing into existence,
and returned from error to truth. So that as to the phrase “of
Whom,” it is not to be understood apart from Christ. For of
Him, through Christ, were we created.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxi-p24">[6.] Nor yet, if you observe, hath he distributed
the names as if belonging exclusively, assigning to the Son the
name Lord, and to the Father, God. For the Scripture useth also
often to interchange them; as when it saith, (<scripRef passage="Ps. cx. 1" id="iv.xxi-p24.1" parsed="|Ps|110|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.110.1">Ps. cx. 1</scripRef>.) “The Lord saith unto My
Lord;” and again, (<scripRef passage="Ps. lxv. 8" id="iv.xxi-p24.2" parsed="|Ps|65|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.65.8">Ps.
lxv. 8</scripRef>.) “Wherefore God
Thy God hath appointed Thee;” and, (<scripRef passage="Rom. ix. 5" id="iv.xxi-p24.3" parsed="|Rom|9|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.9.5">Rom. ix. 5</scripRef>.) “Of Whom is Christ
according to the flesh, Who is God over all.” And in many
instances you may see these names changing their places. Besides,
if they were allotted to each nature severally, and if the Son were
not God, and God as the Father, yet continuing a Son: after
saying, “but to us there is but One God,” it would have been
superfluous, his adding the word “Father,” with a view to
declare the Unbegotten. For the word of God was sufficient to
explain this, if it were such as to denote Him only.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxi-p25">And this is not all, but there is another remark to
make: that if you say, “Because it is said ‘One God,’
therefore the word God doth not apply to the Son;” observe that
the same holds of the Son also. For the Son also is called “One
Lord,” yet we do not maintain that therefore the term Lord
applies to Him alone. So then, the same force which the
expression “One” has, applied to the Son, it has also, applied
to the Father. And as the Father is not thrust out from being the
Lord, in the same sense as the Son is the Lord, because He, the
Son, is spoken of as one Lord; so neither does it cast out the Son
from being God, in the same sense as the Father is God, because the
Father is styled One God.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxi-p26">[7.] Now if any were to say, “Why did he make no
mention of the Spirit?” our answer might be this: His argument
was with idolaters, and the contention was about “gods many and
lords many.” And this is why, having called the Father, God, he
calls the Son, Lord. If now he ventured not to call the Father
Lord together with the Son, lest they might suspect him to be
speaking of two Lords; nor yet the Son, God, with the Father, lest
he might be supposed to speak of two Gods: why marvel at his not
having mentioned the Spirit? His contest was, so far, with the
Gentiles: his point, to signify that with us there is no
plurality of Gods. Wherefore he keeps hold continually of this
word, “One;” saying, “There is no God but One; and, to us
there is One God, and One Lord.” From which it is plain, that
to spare the weakness of the hearers he used this mode of
explanation, and for this reason made no mention at all of the
Spirit. For if it be not this, neither ought he to make mention
of the Spirit elsewhere, nor to join Him with the Father and the
Son. For if He be rejected from the Father and Son, much more
ought He not to be put in the same rank with them in the matter of
Baptism; where most especially the dignity of the Godhead appears
and gifts are bestowed which pertain to God alone to afford. Thus
then I have assigned the cause why in this place He is passed over
in silence. Now do thou if this be not the true reason, tell me,
why He is ranked with Them in Baptism? But thou canst not give
any other reason but His being of equal honor. At any rate, when
he has no such constraint upon him, he puts Him in the same rank,
saying thus: (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. xiii. 14" id="iv.xxi-p26.1" parsed="|2Cor|13|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.13.14">2 Cor.

(ch. <scripRef passage="xii. 4" id="iv.xxi-p27.2" parsed="|2Cor|12|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.12.4">xii. 4</scripRef>.) “There are diversities of
gifts, but the same Spirit: and there are diversities of
administrations, but the same Lord; and there are diversities of
workings but the same God.” But because now his speech was with
Greeks and the weaker sort of the converts from among Greeks, for
this reason he husbands it (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxi-p27.3">ταμιεύεται</span>) so far. And this is what the
prophets do in regard of the Son; no where making mention of Him
plainly because of the infirmity of the hearers.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxi-p28"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 8.7" id="iv.xxi-p28.1" parsed="|1Cor|8|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.8.7">Ver. 7</scripRef>.
“But not in all is knowledge,” saith he. What knowledge doth
he mean? about God, or about things offered in sacrifice to
idols? For either he here glances at the Greeks who say that
there are many gods and lords, and who know not Him that is truly
God; or at the converts from among Greeks who were still rather
infirm, such as did not yet know clearly that they ought not to
fear idols and that “an idol is nothing in the world.” But in
saying this, he gently soothes and encourages the latter. For
there was no need of mentioning all he had to reprove, particularly
as he intended to visit them again with more severity.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxi-p29">[8.] “But some being used to the idol eat as of
a thing sacrificed to an idol, and their con<pb n="115" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_115.html" id="iv.xxi-Page_115" />science being weak is
defiled.” They still tremble at idols, he saith. For tell me
not of the present establishment, and that you have received the
true religion from your ancestors. But carry back your thoughts
to those times, and consider when the Gospel was just set on foot,
and impiety was still at its height, and altars burning, and
sacrifices and libations offering up, and the greater part of men
were Gentiles; think, I say, of those who from their ancestors had
received impiety, and who were the descendants of fathers and
grandfathers and great-grandfathers like themselves, and who had
suffered great miseries from the demons. How must they have felt
after their sudden change!  How would they face and tremble at the
assaults of the demons!  For their sake also he employs some
reserve, saying, “But some with conscience of the things
sacrificed to an idol.<note place="end" n="95" id="iv.xxi-p29.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxi-p30">
<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxi-p30.1">τοῦ εἰδωλοθύτου</span>. rec. text. <span class="Greek" id="iv.xxi-p30.2">εἰδώλου</span>.</p></note>” Thus he neither exposed them
openly, not to strike them hard; nor doth he pass by them
altogether: but makes mention of them in a vague manner, saying,
“Now some with conscience of the idol even until now eat as of a
thing sacrificed to an idol; that is, with the same thoughts as
they did in former times: ‘and their conscience being weak is
defiled;’” not yet being able to despise and once for all laugh
them to scorn, but still in some doubt. Just as if a man were to
think that by touching a dead body he should pollute himself
according to the Jewish custom, and then seeing others touching it
with a clear conscience, but not with the same mind touching it
himself, would be polluted. This was their state of feeling at
that time. “For some,” saith he, “with conscience of the
idol do it even until now.” Not without cause did he add,
“even until now;” but to signify that they gained no ground by
their refusing to condescend. For this was not the way to bring
them in, but in some other way persuading them by word and by
teaching.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxi-p31">“And their conscience being weak is defiled.”
No where as yet doth he state his argument about the nature of the
thing, but turns himself this way and that as concerning the
conscience of the person partaking. For he was afraid lest in his
wish to correct the weak person, he should inflict a heavy blow
upon the strong one, and make him also weak. On which account he
spares the one no less than the other. Nor doth he allow the
thing itself to be thought of any consequence, but makes his
argument very full to prevent any suspicion of the kind.</p>

commend us to God. For neither if we eat are we the better, nor
if we eat not are we the worse.” Do you see how again he takes
down their high spirit? in that, after saying that “not only they
but all of us have knowledge,” and that “no one knoweth any
thing as he ought to know,” and that “knowledge puffeth up;”
then having soothed them, and said that “this knowledge is not in
all,” and that “weakness is the cause of these being
defiled,” in order that they might not say, “And what is it to
us, if knowledge be not in all? Why then has not such an one
knowledge? Why is he weak?”—I say, in order that they might
not rejoin in these terms, he did not proceed immediately to point
out clearly that for fear of the other’s harm one ought to
abstain: but having first made but a sort of skirmish upon
mention of him, he points out what is more than this. What then
is this? That although no one were injured nor any perversion of
another ensued, not even in this case were it right so to do. For
the former topic by itself is laboring in vain. Since he that
hears of another being hurt while himself has the gain, is not very
apt to abstain; but then rather he doth so, when he finds out that
he himself is no way advantaged by the thing. Wherefore he sets
this down first, saying, “But meat commendeth us not to God.”
See how cheap he holds that which was accounted to spring from
perfect knowledge!  “For neither if we eat are we the better,”
(that is, stand higher in God’s estimation, as if we had done any
thing good or great:)  “nor if we eat not are we the worse,”
that is, fall in any way short of others. So far then he hath
signified that the thing itself is superfluous, and as nothing.
For that which being done profits not, and which being left undone
injures not, must be superfluous.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxi-p33">[10.] But as he goes on, he discloses all the harm
which was likely to arise from the matter. For the present,
however, that which befel the brethren is his subject.</p>

knowledge,” which would have sounded more like praise; nor
“this your perfectness;” but, “your liberty;” a thing which
seemed to savor more of rashness and obstinacy and arrogance.
Neither said he, “To the brethren,” but, “To those of the
brethren who are weak;” enhancing his accusation from their not
even sparing the weak, and those too their brethren. For let it
be so that you correct them not, nor arouse them: yet why trip
them up, <pb n="116" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_116.html" id="iv.xxi-Page_116" />and make them to

“weakness,” that the mischief may not be thought to arise from
the nature of the thing, nor demons appear formidable. As thus: 
“At present,” saith he, “a man is on the point of withdrawing
himself entirely from all idols; but when he sees you fond of
loitering about them, he takes the circumstance for a
recommendation and abides there himself also. So that not only
his weakness, but also your ill-timed behavior, helps to further
the plot against him; for it is you who make him weaker.”</p>

weak perisheth, the brother for whose sake Christ
died.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxi-p41">For there are two things which deprive you of excuse
in this mischief; one, that he is weak, the other, that he is thy
brother: rather, I should say, there is a third also, and one
more terrible than all. What then is this? That whereas Christ
refused not even to die for him, thou canst not bear even to
accommodate thyself to him. By these means, you see, he reminds
the perfect man also, what he too was before, and that for him He
died. And he said not, “For whom even to die was thy duty;”
but what is much stronger, that even Christ died for his sake.
“Did thy Lord then not refuse to die for him, and dost thou so
make him of none account as not even to abstain from a polluted
table for his sake? Yea, dost thou permit him to perish, after
the salvation so wrought, and, what is still more grievous, ‘for
a morsel of meat?’ “For he said not, “for thy
perfectness,” nor “for thy knowledge,” but “for thy
meat.” So that the charges are four, and these extremely
heavy: that it was a brother, that he was weak, and one of whom
Christ made so much account as even to die for him, and that after
all this for a “morsel of meat” he is destroyed.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxi-p42"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 8.12" id="iv.xxi-p42.1" parsed="|1Cor|8|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.8.12">Ver. 12</scripRef>. “And thus sinning against
the brethren, and wounding their weak conscience, ye sin against
Christ.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxi-p43">Do you observe how quietly and gradually he hath
brought their offence up to the very summit of iniquity? And
again, he makes mention of the infirmity of the other sort: and
so, the very thing which these considered to make for them, that he
every where turns round upon their own head. And he said not,
“Putting stumbling-blocks in their way,” but, “wounding;”
so as by the force of his expression to indicate their cruelty.
For what can be more savage than a man who wounds the sick? and yet
no wound is so grievous as making a man to stumble. Often, in
fact, is this also the cause of death.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxi-p44">But how do they “sin against Christ?” In one
way, because He considers the concerns of His servants as His own;
in another, because those who are wounded go to make up His Body
and that which is part of Him: in a third way, because that work
of His which He built up by His own blood, these are destroying for
their ambition’s sake.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxi-p45">[11.] <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 8.13" id="iv.xxi-p45.1" parsed="|1Cor|8|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.8.13">Ver. 13</scripRef>. “Wherefore, if meat make
my brother to stumble, I will eat no flesh for ever.” This is
like the best of teachers, to teach in his own person the things
which he speaks. Nor did he say whether justly or unjustly; but
in any case. “I say not,” (such is his tone,) “meat offered
in sacrifice to an idol, which is already prohibited for another
reason; but if any even of those things which are within license
and are permitted causes stumbling, from these also will I
abstain: and not one or two days, but all the time of my
life.” For he saith, “I will eat no flesh for ever.” And
he said not, “Lest I destroy my brother,” but simply, “That I
make not my brother to stumble.” For indeed it comes of folly
in the extreme that what things are greatly cared for by Christ,
and such as He should have even chosen to die for them, these we
should esteem so entirely beneath our notice as not even to abstain
from meats on their account.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxi-p46">Now these things might be seasonably spoken not to
them only, but also to us, apt as we are to esteem lightly the
salvation of our neighbors and to utter those satanical words. I
say, satanical: for the expression, “What care I, though such
an one stumble, and such another perish?” savors of his cruelty
and inhuman mind. And yet in that instance, the infirmity also of
those who were offended had some share in the result: but in our
case it is not so, sinning as we do in such a way as to offend even
the strong. For when we smite, and raven, and overreach, and use
the free as if they were slaves, whom is not this enough to
offend? Tell me not of such a man’s being a shoemaker, another
a dyer, another a brazier: but bear in mind that he is a believer
and a brother. Why these are they whose disciples we are; the
fishermen, <pb n="117" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_117.html" id="iv.xxi-Page_117" />the publicans, the
tent-makers, of Him who was brought up in the house of a carpenter;
and who deigned to have the carpenter’s betrothed wife for a
mother; and who was laid, after His swaddling clothes, in a manger;
and who had not where to lay His head;—of Him whose journeys were
so long that His very journeying was enough to tire Him down; of
Him who was supported by others.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxi-p47">[12.] Think on these things, and esteem the pride
of man to be nothing. But count the tent-maker as well as thy
brother, as him that is borne upon a chariot and hath innumerable
servants and struts in the market-place: nay, rather the former
than the latter; since the term brother would more naturally be
used where there is the greater resemblance. Which then resembles
the fisherman? He who is supported by daily labor and hath
neither servant nor dwelling, but is quite beset with privations;
or that other who is surrounded with such vast pomp, and who acts
contrary to the laws of God? Despise not then him that is more of
the two thy brother, for he comes nearer to the Apostolic
pattern.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxi-p48">“Not however,” say you, “of his own accord,
but by compulsion; for he doeth not this of his own mind.” How
comes this? Hast thou not heard, “Judge not, that ye be not
judged?” But, to convince thyself that he doeth it not against
his inclination, approach and give him ten thousand talents of
gold, and thou shalt see him putting it away from him. And thus,
even though he have received no wealth by inheritance from his
ancestors, yet when it is in his power to take it, and he lets it
not come near him neither adds to his goods, he exhibits a mighty
proof of his contempt of wealth. For so John was the son of
Zebedee that extremely poor man: yet I suppose we are not
therefore to say that his poverty was forced upon him.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxi-p49">Whensoever then thou seest one driving nails,
smiting with a hammer, covered with soot, do not therefore hold him
cheap, but rather for that reason admire him. Since even Peter
girded himself, and handled the dragnet, and went a fishing after
the Resurrection of the Lord.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxi-p50">And why say I Peter? For this same Paul himself,
after his incessant runnings to and fro and all those vast
miracles, standing in a tent-maker’s shop, sewed hides
together: while angels were reverencing him and demons
trembling. And he was not ashamed to say, (<scripRef passage="Acts xx. 34" id="iv.xxi-p50.1" parsed="|Acts|20|34|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.20.34">Acts xx. 34</scripRef>.) “Unto my necessities, and
to those who were with me, these hands ministered.” What say I,
that he was not ashamed? Yea, he gloried in this very thing.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxi-p51">But you will say, “Who is there now to be compared
with the virtue of Paul?” I too am aware that there is no one,
yet not on this account are those who live now to be despised: 
for if for Christ’s sake thou give honor, though one be last of
all, yet if he be a believer he shall justly be honored. For
suppose a general and a common soldier both present themselves
before you, being friends of the king, and you open your house to
both: in which of their persons would you seem to pay most honor
to the king? Plainly in that of a soldier. For there were in
the general, beside his loyalty to the king, many other things apt
to win such a mark of respect from you: but the soldier had
nothing else but his loyalty to the king.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxi-p52">Wherefore God bade us call to our suppers and
our feasts the lame, and the maimed, and those who cannot repay us;
for these are most of all properly called good deeds which are done
for God’s sake. Whereas if thou entertain some great and
distinguished man, it is not such pure mercy, what thou doest: 
but some portion many times is assigned to thyself also,<note place="end" n="98" id="iv.xxi-p52.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxi-p53">
<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxi-p53.1">μερίζεταί τι πρὸς σε</span>.</p></note> both by vain-glory, and by the
return of the favor, and by thy rising in many men’s estimation
on account of thy guest. At any rate, I think I could point out
many who with this view pay court to the more distinguished among
the saints, namely, that by their means they may enjoy a greater
intimacy with rulers, and that they may find them thenceforth more
useful in their own affairs and to their families. And many such
favors do they ask in recompense from those saints; a thing which
mars the repayment of their hospitality, they seeking it with such
a mind.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxi-p54">And why need I say this about the saints? Since he
who seeks, even from God, the reward of his labors in the present
life and follows after virtue for this world’s good, is sure to
diminish his recompense. But he that asks for all his crowns
wholly there, is found far more admirable; like that Lazarus, who
even now is “receiving” (St. 
<scripRef passage="Luke xvi. 25" id="iv.xxi-p54.1" parsed="|Luke|16|25|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.16.25">Luke xvi. 25</scripRef>.) there all “his good
things;” like those Three Children, who when they were on the
point of being thrown into the furnace said, (<scripRef passage="Dan. xvii. 17, 18" id="iv.xxi-p54.2" parsed="|Dan|17|17|17|18" osisRef="Bible:Dan.17.17-Dan.17.18">Dan. xvii. 17, 18</scripRef>.) “There is a God in
heaven able to deliver us; and if not, be it known unto thee, O
king, that we serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image
which thou hast set up:” like Abraham, who even offered<note place="end" n="99" id="iv.xxi-p54.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxi-p55">
<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxi-p55.1">ἀνήγαγε</span>.</p></note> his son and slew him; and this he
did, not for any reward, but esteeming this one thing the greatest
recompense, to obey the Lord.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxi-p56">These let us also imitate. For so shall we be
visited with a return of all our good deeds and that abundantly,
because we do all with such a mind as this: so shall we obtain
also the <pb n="118" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_118.html" id="iv.xxi-Page_118" />brighter crowns. And
God grant that we may all obtain them, through the grace and
loving-kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, with Whom, to the Father
and the Holy Spirit, be glory, power, honor, now, henceforth, and
for everlasting ages. Amen.</p>

<p class="c27" id="iv.xxii-p3">Am I not an Apostle? am I not free? have I not seen
Jesus Christ our Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord?</p>

<p class="c24" id="iv.xxii-p4"><span class="c18" id="iv.xxii-p4.1">Inasmuch</span> as he had said,
“If meat make my brother to stumble I will eat no flesh
forever;” a thing which he had not yet done, but professed he
would do if need require: lest any man should say, “Thou
vauntest thyself at random, and art severe in discourse, and
utterest words of promise, a thing easy to me or to any body; but
if these sayings come from thy heart, shew by deeds something which
thou hast slighted in order to avoid making thy brother
stumble:” for this cause, I say, in what follows he is
compelled to enter on the proof of this also, and to point out how
he was used to forego even things permitted that he might not give
offence, although without any law to enforce his doing so.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxii-p5">And we are not yet come to the admirable part
of the matter: though it be admirable that he abstain even from
things lawful to avoid offence: but it is his habit of doing so
at the cost of so much trouble and danger<note place="end" n="100" id="iv.xxii-p5.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxii-p6"> The reading here adopted is Savile’s.</p></note>. “For why,” saith he,
“speak of the idol sacrifices? Since although Christ had
enjoined that those who preach the Gospel should live at the charge
of their disciples, I did not so, but chose, if need were, to end
my life with famine and die the most grievous of deaths, so I might
avoid receiving of those whom I instruct.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxii-p7">Not because they would otherwise be made to
stumble, but because his not receiving would edify them<note place="end" n="101" id="iv.xxii-p7.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxii-p8"> A slight transposition has been made here: the
sense seeming to require it.</p></note>: a much
greater thing for him to do. And to witness this he summons
themselves, among whom he was used to live in toil and in hunger,
nourished by others, and put to straits, in order not to offend
them. And yet there was no ground for their taking offence, for
it would but have been a law which he was fulfilling. But for all
this, by a sort of supererogation<note place="end" n="102" id="iv.xxii-p8.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxii-p9"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxii-p9.1">ἐκ
περιουσίας</span>.</p></note> he used to spare them.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxii-p10">Now if he did more than was enacted lest they should
take offence, and abstained from permitted things to edify others;
what must they deserve who abstain not from idol sacrifices? and
that, when many perish thereby? a thing which even apart from all
scandal one ought to shrink from, as being “the table of
demons.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxii-p11">The sum therefore of this whole topic is this which
he works out in many verses. But we must resume it and make a
fresh entrance on what he hath alleged. For neither hath he set
it down thus expressly as I have worded it; nor doth he leap at
once upon it; but begins from another topic, thus speaking;</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxii-p12">[2.] “Am I not an Apostle?” For
besides all that hath been said, this also makes no small
difference that Paul himself is the person thus conducting
himself. As thus: To prevent their alleging, “You may taste
of the sacrifices, sealing<note place="end" n="103" id="iv.xxii-p12.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxii-p13"> i.e. making the sign of the Cross: <span class="Greek" id="iv.xxii-p13.1">σφραγίζοντι</span>.</p></note> at the same time:” for a while
he withstands not that statement, but argues, “Though it were
lawful, your brethren’s harm should keep you from doing so;”
and afterwards he proves that it is not even lawful. In this
particular place, however, he establishes the former point from
circumstances relating to himself. And intending presently to say
that he had received nothing from them, he sets it not down at
once, but his own dignity is what he first affirms: “Am I not
an Apostle? am I not free?”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxii-p14">Thus, to hinder their saying, “True; thou didst
not receive, but the reason thou didst not was its not being
lawful;” he sets down therefore first the causes why he might
reasonably have received, had he been willing to do so.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxii-p15">Further: that there might not seem to be any thing
invidious in regard of Peter and such as Peter, in his saying these
things, (for they did not use to decline receiving;) he first shows
that they had authority to receive, and then that no one might say,
“Peter had authority to receive but thou hadst not,” he
possesses the hearer beforehand with these encomiums of himself.
And perceiving that he must praise 
<pb n="119" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_119.html" id="iv.xxii-Page_119" />himself, (for that was the way to correct the
Corinthians,) yet disliking to say any great thing of himself, see
how he hath tempered both feelings as the occasion required: 
limiting his own panegyric, not by what he knew of himself, but by
what the subject of necessity required. For he might have said,
“I most of all had a right to receive, even more than they,
because ‘I labored more abundantly than they.’”  But this he
omits, being a point wherein he surpassed them; and those points
wherein they were great and which were just grounds for their
receiving, those only he sets down: as follows:</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxii-p16">“Am I not an Apostle? am I not free?” i.e.
“have I not authority over myself? am I under any, to overrule me
and forbid my receiving?”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxii-p17">“But they have an advantage over you, in having
been with Christ.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxii-p18">“Nay, neither is this denied me.” With a view
to which he saith,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxii-p19">“Have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord?” For
“last of all,” (c. <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 15.8" id="iv.xxii-p19.1" parsed="|1Cor|15|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.15.8">xv. 8</scripRef>.) saith he, “as unto one
born out of due time, He appeared unto me also.” Now this
likewise was no small dignity: since “many Prophets,” (S.
<scripRef passage="Matt. xiii. 17" id="iv.xxii-p19.2" parsed="|Matt|13|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.13.17">Matt. xiii. 17</scripRef>.) saith He, “and righteous
men have desired to see the things which ye see, and have not seen
them:” and, “Days will come when ye shall desire to see one
of these days.” (S. <scripRef passage="Luke xvii. 22" id="iv.xxii-p19.3" parsed="|Luke|17|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.17.22">Luke
xvii. 22</scripRef>.)</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxii-p20">“What then, though thou be ‘an Apostle,’ and
‘free,’ and hast ‘seen Christ,’ if thou hast not exhibited
any work of an Apostle; how then can it be right for thee to
receive?” Wherefore after this he adds,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxii-p21">“Are not ye my work in the Lord?” For this is
the great thing; and those others avail nothing, apart from this.
Even Judas himself was “an Apostle,” and “free,” and “saw
Christ;” but because he had not “the work of an Apostle,” all
those things profited him not. You see then why he adds this
also, and calls themselves to be witnesses of it.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxii-p22">Moreover, because it was a great thing which he had
uttered, see how he chastens it, adding, “In the Lord:” i.e.,
“the work is God’s, not mine.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxii-p23"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 9.2" id="iv.xxii-p23.1" parsed="|1Cor|9|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.9.2">Ver. 2</scripRef>.
“If to others I am not an Apostle, yet at least I am to
you.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxii-p24">Do you see how far he is from enlarging here without
necessity? And yet he had the whole world to speak of, and
barbarous nations, and sea and land. However, he mentions none of
these things, but carries his point by concession, and even
granting more than he need. As if he had said, “Why need I
dwell on things over and above, since these even alone are enough
for my present purpose? I speak not, you will observe, of my
achievements in other quarters, but of those which have you for
witnesses. Upon which it follows that if from no other quarter,
yet from you I have a right to receive. Nevertheless, from whom I
had most right to receive, even you whose teacher I was, from those
I received not.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxii-p25">“If to others I am not an Apostle, yet at least I
am to you.” Again, he states his point by concession. For the
whole world had him for its Apostle. “However,” saith he,
“I say not that, I am not contending nor disputing, but what
concerns you I lay down. ‘For the seal of mine Apostleship are
ye:’” i.e., its proof. “Should any one, moreover, desire
to learn whence I am an Apostle, you are the persons whom I bring
forward: for all the signs of an Apostle have I exhibited among
you, and not one have I failed in.” As also he speaks in the
Second Epistle, saying, (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. xii. 12" id="iv.xxii-p25.1" parsed="|2Cor|12|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.12.12">2
Cor. xii. 12</scripRef>.) “Though
I am nothing, truly the signs of an Apostle were wrought among you
in all patience, by signs and wonders and mighty works. For what
is there wherein ye were made inferior to the rest of the
Churches?” Wherefore he saith, “The seal of mine Apostleship
are ye.” “For I both exhibited miracles, and taught by word,
and underwent dangers, and shewed forth a blameless life.” And
these topics you may see fully set forth by these two Epistles, how
he lays before them the demonstration of each with all
exactness.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxii-p26">[3.] <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 9.3" id="iv.xxii-p26.1" parsed="|1Cor|9|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.9.3">Ver. 3</scripRef>. “My defence to them that
examine me is this.” What is, “My defence to them that
examine me is this?” “To those who seek to know whereby I am
proved to be an Apostle, or who accuse me as receiving money, or
inquire the cause of my not receiving, or would fain shew that I am
not an Apostle: to all such, my instruction given to you and
these things which I am about to say, may stand for a full
explanation and defence.” What then are these?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxii-p27"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 9.4,5" id="iv.xxii-p27.1" parsed="|1Cor|9|4|9|5" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.9.4-1Cor.9.5">Ver. 4, 5</scripRef>. “Have we no right to eat
and to drink? Have we no right to lead about a wife that is a
believer?” Why, how are these sayings a defence? “Because,
when it appears that I abstain even from things which are allowed,
it cannot be just to look suspiciously on me as a deceiver or one
acting for gain.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxii-p28">Wherefore, from what was before alleged and from my
having instructed you and from this which I have now said, I have
matter sufficient to make my defence to you: and all who examine
me I meet upon this ground, alleging both what has gone before and
this which follows: “Have we no right to eat and to drink? have
we no right to lead about a wife that is a believer? “Yet for
all this, having it I abstain?”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxii-p29">What then? did he not use to eat or to drink? 
<pb n="120" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_120.html" id="iv.xxii-Page_120" />It were most true to say that
in many places he really did not eat nor drink: for (c. <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 5.11" id="iv.xxii-p29.1" parsed="|1Cor|5|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.5.11">iv.
11</scripRef>.) “in hunger,”
saith he, “and in thirst, and in nakedness” we were
abiding.” Here, however, this is not his meaning; but what? 
“We eat not nor drink, receiving of those whom we instruct,
though we have a right so to receive.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxii-p30">“Have we no right to lead about a wife that is a
believer, even as the rest of the Apostles, and the brethren of the
Lord, and Cephas?” Observe his skilfulness. The leader of the
choir stands last in his arrangement: since that is the time for
laying down the strongest of all one’s topics. Nor was it so
wonderful for one to be able to point out examples of this conduct
in the rest, as in the foremost champion and in him who was
entrusted with the keys of heaven. But neither does he mention
Peter alone, but all of them: as if he had said, Whether you seek
the inferior sort or the more eminent, in all you find patterns of
this sort.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxii-p31">For the brethren too of the Lord, being freed from
their first unbelief (vid. S. 
<scripRef passage="John vii. 5" id="iv.xxii-p31.1" parsed="|John|7|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.7.5">John vii. 5</scripRef>.), had come to be among those
who were approved, although they attained not to the Apostles.
And accordingly the middle place is that which he hath assigned to
them, setting down those who were in the extremes before and
after.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxii-p32"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 9.6" id="iv.xxii-p32.1" parsed="|1Cor|9|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.9.6">Ver. 6</scripRef>.
“Or I only and Barnabas, have we not a right to forbear
working?”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxii-p33">(See his humility of mind and his soul pure from
envy, how he takes care not to conceal him whom he knew to be a
partaker with himself in this perfection.) For if the other
things be common, how is not this common? Both they and we are
apostles and are free, and have seen Christ, and have exhibited the
works of Apostles. Therefore we likewise have a right both to
live without working and to be supported by our disciples.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxii-p34">[4.] <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 9.7" id="iv.xxii-p34.1" parsed="|1Cor|9|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.9.7">Ver. 7</scripRef>. “What soldier ever
serveth at his own charges?” For since, which was the strongest
point, he had proved from the Apostles that it is lawful to do so,
he next comes to examples and to the common practice; as he uses to
do: “What soldier serveth at his own charges?” saith he.
But do thou consider, I pray, how very suitable are the examples to
his proposed subject, and how he mentions first that which is
accompanied with danger; viz. soldiership and arms and wars. For
such a kind of thing was the Apostolate, nay rather much more
hazardous than these. For not with men alone was their warfare,
but with demons also, and against the prince of those beings was
their battle array. What he saith therefore is this: “Not
even do heathen governors, cruel and unjust as they are, require
their soldiers to endure service and peril and live on their own
means. How then could Christ ever have required this?”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxii-p35">Nor is he satisfied with one example. For to him
who is rather simple and dull, this also is wont to come as a great
refreshment, viz. their seeing the common custom also going along
with the laws of God. Wherefore he proceeds to another topic also
and says, “Who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit
thereof?” For as by the former he indicated his dangers, so by
this his labor and abundant travail and care.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxii-p36">He adds likewise a third example, saying, “Who
feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk thereof?” He is
exhibiting the great concern which it becomes a teacher to show for
those who are under his rule. For, in fact, the Apostles were
both soldiers and husbandmen and shepherds, not of the earth nor of
irrational animals, nor in such wars as are perceptible by sense;
but of reasonable souls and in battle array with the demons.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxii-p37">It also must be remarked how every where he
preserves moderation, seeking the useful only, not the
extraordinary. For he said not, “What soldier serveth and is
not enriched?” but, “What soldier ever serveth at his own
charges?” Neither did he say, “Who planteth a vineyard, and
gathereth not gold, or spareth to collect the whole fruit?” but,
“Who eateth not of the fruit thereof?” Neither did he say,
“Who feedeth a flock, and maketh not merchandize of the
lambs?” But what? “And eateth not of the milk thereof?”
Not of the lambs, but of the milk; signifying, that a little relief
should be enough for the teacher, even his necessary food alone.
(This refers to those who would devour all and gather the whole of
the fruit.) “So likewise the Lord ordained,” saying, “The
laborer is worthy of his food.” (St. 
<scripRef passage="Matt. x. 10" id="iv.xxii-p37.1" parsed="|Matt|10|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.10.10">Matt. x. 10</scripRef>.)</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxii-p38">And not this only doth he establish by his
illustrations, but he shows also what kind of man a priest ought to
be. For he ought to possess both the courage of a soldier and the
diligence of a husbandman and the carefulness of a shepherd, and
after all these, to seek nothing more than necessaries.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxii-p39">[5.] Having shewn, as you see, both from the
Apostles, that it is not forbidden the teacher to receive, and from
illustrations found in common life, he proceeds also to a third
head, thus saying,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxii-p40"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 9.8" id="iv.xxii-p40.1" parsed="|1Cor|9|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.9.8">Ver. 8</scripRef>.
“Do I speak these things after the manner of men? or saith not
the law also the same?”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxii-p41">For since he had hitherto alleged nothing out of the
Scriptures, but put forward the common custom; “think not,”
saith he, “that I am confident in these alone, nor that I go to
the opinions of men for the ground of these enactments. For I can
shew that these things are <pb n="121" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_121.html" id="iv.xxii-Page_121" />also
well-pleasing to God, and I read an ancient law enjoining
them.” Wherefore also he carries on his discourse in the form
of a question, which is apt to be done in things fully
acknowledged; thus saying, “Say I these things after the manner
of men?” i.e. “do I strengthen myself only by human
examples?” “or saith not the law also the same?”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxii-p42"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 9.9" id="iv.xxii-p42.1" parsed="|1Cor|9|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.9.9">Ver. 9</scripRef>.
“For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the
ox when he treadeth out the corn.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxii-p43">And on what account hath he mentioned this, having
the example of the priests? Wishing to establish it far beyond
what the case required. Further, lest any should say, “And what
have we to do with the saying about the oxen?” he works it out
more exactly, saying, “Is it for the oxen that God careth;”
Doth God then, tell me, take no care for oxen? Well, He doth take
care of them, but not so as to make a law concerning such a thing
as this. So that had he not been hinting at something important,
training the Jews to mercy in the case of the brutes, and through
these, discoursing with them of the teachers also; he would not
have taken so much interest as even to make a law to forbid the
muzzling of oxen.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxii-p44">Wherein he points out another thing likewise, that
the labor of teachers both is and ought to be great.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxii-p45">And again another thing. What then is
this? That whatever is said by the Old Testament respecting care
for brutes, in its principal meaning bears on the instruction of
human beings: as in fact do all the rest: the precepts, for
example, concerning various garments; and those concerning
vineyards and seeds and not making the ground bear divers crops,<note place="end" n="104" id="iv.xxii-p45.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxii-p46"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxii-p46.1">διάφορον ποιεῖν τὴν
γῆν</span>. See <scripRef passage="Deut. xxii. 9" id="iv.xxii-p46.2" parsed="|Deut|22|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Deut.22.9">Deut.
xxii. 9</scripRef>. LXX.</p></note> and those
concerning leprosy; and, in a word, all the rest: for they being
of a duller sort He was discoursing with them from these topics,
advancing them by little and little.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxii-p47">And see how in what follows he doth not even confirm
it, as being clear and self-evident. For having said, “Is it
for the oxen that God careth?” he added, “or saith he it
altogether for our sake?” Not adding even the “altogether”
at random, but that he might not leave the hearer any thing
whatever to reply.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxii-p48">And he dwells upon the metaphor, saying and
declaring, “Yea for our sakes it was written, because he who
ploweth ought to plow in hope;” i.e., the teacher ought to enjoy
the returns of his labors; “and he that thresheth ought to thresh
in hope of partaking.” And observe his wisdom in that from the
seed he transferred the matter to the threshing floor; herein also
again manifesting the many toils of the teachers, that they in
their own persons both plough and tread the floor. And of the
ploughing, because there was nothing to reap, but labor only, he
used the word, “hope;” but of treading the floor he presently
allows the fruit, saying, “He that thresheth is a partaker of his
hope.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxii-p49">Further, lest any should say, “Is this then the
return for so many toils,” he adds, “in hope,” i.e., “which
is to come.” No other thing therefore doth the mouth of this
animal being unmuzzled declare than this; that the teachers who
labor ought also to enjoy some return.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxii-p50">[6.] <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 9.11" id="iv.xxii-p50.1" parsed="|1Cor|9|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.9.11">Ver. 11</scripRef>. “If we sowed unto you
spiritual things, is it a great matter if we shall reap your carnal
things?”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxii-p51">Lo, he adds also a fourth argument for the duty of
yielding support. For since he had said, “What soldier ever
serveth at his own charges?” and, “who planteth a vineyard?”
and, “who feedeth a flock?” and introduced the ox that treadeth
the corn; he points out likewise another most reasonable cause on
account of which they might justly receive; viz. having bestowed
much greater gifts, no more as having labored only. What is it
then? “if we sowed unto you spiritual things, is it a great
matter if we shall reap your carnal things?” Seest thou a most
just allegation and fuller of reason than all the former? for “in
those instances,” says he, “carnal is the seed, carnal also is
the fruit; but here not so, but the seed is spiritual, the return
carnal.” Thus, to prevent high thoughts in those who contribute
to their teachers, he signified that they receive more than they
give. As if he had said, “Husbandmen, whatsoever they sow, this
also do they receive; but we, sowing in your souls spiritual
things, do reap carnal.” For such is the kind of support given
by them. Further, and still more to put them to the blush.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxii-p52"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 9.12" id="iv.xxii-p52.1" parsed="|1Cor|9|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.9.12">Ver. 12</scripRef>. “If others partake of
this right over you, do not we yet more?”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxii-p53">See also again another argument, and this too from
examples though not of the same kind. For it is not Peter whom he
mentions here nor the Apostles, but certain other spurious ones,
with whom he afterwards enters into combat, and concerning whom he
says, (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. xi. 20" id="iv.xxii-p53.1" parsed="|2Cor|11|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.11.20">2 Cor. xi. 20</scripRef>.) “If a man devour
you, if he take you captive, if he exalt himself, if he smite you
on the face,” and already he is sounding the prelude<note place="end" n="105" id="iv.xxii-p53.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxii-p54"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxii-p54.1">προανακρούεται</span>.</p></note> to the fight
with them. Wherefore neither did he say, “If others take of
you,” but pointing out their insolence and tyranny and
trafficking, he says, “if others partake of this right over
you,” i.e., “rule you, exercise authority, use you as servants,
not taking you captive only, but with much authority.”
Wherefore he added “do not we yet more?” which he would not
have said if <pb n="122" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_122.html" id="iv.xxii-Page_122" />the
discourse were concerning the Apostles. But it is evident that he
hints at certain pestilent men, and deceivers of them. “So that
besides the law of Moses even ye yourselves have made a law in
behalf of the duty of contribution.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxii-p55">And having said, “do not we yet more?” he does
not prove why yet more, but leaves it to their consciences to
convince them of that, wishing at the same time both to alarm and
to abash them more thoroughly.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxii-p56">[7.] Nevertheless, we did not use this right;”
i.e., “did not receive.” Do you see, when he had by so many
reasons before proved that receiving is not unlawful, how he next
says, “we receive not,” that he might not seem to abstain as
from a thing forbidden? “For not because it is unlawful,”
saith he, “do I not receive; for it is lawful and this we have
many ways shown: from the Apostles; from the affairs of life, the
soldier, the husbandman, and the shepherd; from the law of Moses;
from the very nature of the case, in that we have sown unto you
spiritual things; from what yourselves have done to others.”
But as he had laid down these things, lest he should seem to put to
shame the Apostles who were in the habit of receiving; abashing
them and signifying that not as from a forbidden thing doth he
abstain from it: so again, lest by his large store of proof and
the examples and reasonings by which he had pointed out the
propriety of receiving, he should seem to be anxious to receive
himself and therefore to say these things; he now corrects it.
And afterwards he laid it down more clearly where he says, “And I
wrote not these things, that it may be so done in my case;” but
here his words are, “we did not use this right.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxii-p57">And what is a still greater thing, neither could any
have this to say, that being in abundance we declined using it;
rather, when necessity pressed upon us we would not yield to the
necessity. Which also in the second Epistle he says; “I robbed
other Churches, taking wages of them that I might minister unto
you; and when I was present with you, and was in want, I was not a
burden on any man.” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. xi. 8, 9" id="iv.xxii-p57.1" parsed="|2Cor|11|8|11|9" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.11.8-2Cor.11.9">2
Cor. xi. 8, 9</scripRef>.) And in
this Epistle again, “We both hunger, and thirst, and are naked,
and are buffeted.” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. iv. 11" id="iv.xxii-p57.2" parsed="|1Cor|4|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.4.11">1
Cor. iv. 11</scripRef>.) And
here again he hints the same thing, saying, “But we bear all
things.” For by saying, “we bear all things,” he intimates
both hunger and great straits and all the other things. “But
not even thus have we been compelled,” saith he, “to break the
law which we laid down for ourselves. Wherefore? “that we may
cause no hinderance to the Gospel of Christ.” For since the
Corinthians were rather weak-minded, “lest we should wound
you,” saith he “by receiving, we chose to do even more than was
commanded rather than hinder the Gospel,” i.e., your
instruction. Now if we in a matter left free to us, and when we
were both enduring much hardship and having Apostles for our
pattern, used abstinence lest we should give hindrance, (and he did
not say, “subversion,” but “hindrance;” nor simply
“hindrance,” but “any” hindrance,) that we might not, so to
speak, cause so much as the slightest suspense and delay to the
course of the Word: “If now,” saith he, “we used so great
care, how much more ought you to abstain, who both come far short
of the Apostles and have no law to mention, giving you
permission: but contrariwise are both putting your hand to things
forbidden and things which tend to the great injury of the Gospel,
not to its hindrance only<note place="end" n="106" id="iv.xxii-p57.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxii-p58"> The reading seems imperfect, and unintelligible: 
it is rendered as if it were, <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxii-p58.1">οὐκ ἐπὶ τῷ
ἐγκοπὴν μόνον δοῦναι</span>.</p></note>; and not even having any pressing
necessity in view.” For all this discussion he had moved on
account of these Corinthians, who were making their weaker brethren
to stumble by eating of things sacrificed to idols.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxii-p59">[8.] These things also let us listen to, beloved;
that we may not despise those who are offended, nor, “cause any
hindrance to the Gospel of Christ;” that we may not betray our
own salvation. And say not thou to me when thy brother is
offended, “this or that, whereby he is offended, hath not been
forbidden; it is permitted.” For I have something greater to
say to thee: “although Christ Himself have permitted it, yet if
thou seest any injured, stop and do not use the permission.”
For this also did Paul; when he might have received, Christ having
granted permission, he received not. Thus hath our Lord in His
mercy mingled much gentleness with His precepts that it might not
be all merely of commandment, but that we might do much also of our
own mind. Since it was in His power, had He not been so minded,
to extend the commandments further and to say, “he who fasts not
continually, let him be chastised; he who keeps not his virginity,
let him be punished; he that doth not strip himself of all that he
hath, let him suffer the severest penalty.” But he did not so,
giving thee occasion, if thou wilt, to be forward in doing more.
Wherefore both when He was discoursing about virginity, He said,
“He that is able to receive, let him receive it:” and in the
case of the rich man, some things He commanded, but some He left to
the determination of his mind. For He said not, “Sell what thou
hast,” but, “If thou wilt be perfect, sell.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxii-p60">But we are not only not forward to do more, and to
go beyond the precepts, but we fall very short even of the measure
of things commanded. <pb n="123" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_123.html" id="iv.xxii-Page_123" />And
whereas Paul suffered hunger that he might not hinder the Gospel;
we have not the heart even to touch what is in our own stores,
though we see innumerable souls overthrown. “Yea” saith one,
“let the moth eat, and let not the poor eat; let the worm devour,
and let not the naked be clothed; let all be wasted away with time,
and let not Christ be fed; and this when He hungereth.” “Why,
who said this?” it will be asked. Nay, this is the very
grievance, that not in words but in deeds these things are said: 
for it were less grievous uttered in words than done in deeds.
For is not this the cry, day by day, of the inhuman and cruel
tyrant, Covetousness, to those who are led captive by her? “Let
your goods be set before informers and robbers and traitors for
luxury, and not before the hungry and needy for their
sustenance.” Is it not ye then who make robbers? Is it not ye
who minister fuel to the fire of the envious? Is it not ye who
make vagabonds and traitors, putting your wealth before them for a
bait? What madness is this? (for a madness it is, and plain
distraction,) to fill your chests with apparel, and overlook him
that is made after God’s image and similitude, naked and
trembling with cold, and with difficulty keeping himself
upright.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxii-p61">“But he pretends,” saith one, “this tremor and
weakness.” And dost thou not fear lest a thunderbolt from
heaven, kindled by this word, should fall upon thee? (For I am
bursting with wrath: bear with me.) Thou, I say, pampering and
fattening thyself and extending thy potations to the dead of night
and comforting thyself in soft coverlets, dost not deem thyself
liable to judgment, so lawlessly using the gifts of God: (for
wine was not made that we should be drunken; nor food, that we
should pamper our appetites; nor meats, that we should distend the
belly.) But from the poor, the wretched, from him that is as good
as dead, from him demandest thou strict accounts, and dost thou not
fear Christ’s tribunal, so full of all awfulness and terror? 
Why, if he do play the hypocrite, he doth it of necessity and want,
because of thy cruelty and inhumanity, requiring the use of such
masks and refusing all inclination to mercy. For who is so
wretched and miserable as without urgent necessity, for one loaf of
bread, to submit to such disgrace, and to bewail himself and endure
so severe a punishment? So that this hypocrisy of his goeth
about, the herald of thine inhumanity. For since by supplicating
and beseeching and uttering piteous expressions and lamenting and
weeping and going about all day, he doth not obtain even necessary
food, he devised perhaps even this contrivance also, the disgrace
and blame whereof falls not so much on himself as on thee: for he
indeed is meet to be pitied because he hath fallen into so great
necessity; but we are worthy of innumerable punishments because we
compel the poor to suffer such things. For if we would easily
give way, never would he have chosen to endure such things.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxii-p62">And why speak I of nakedness and trembling? For I
will tell a thing yet more to be shuddered at, that some have been
compelled even to deprive their children of sight at an early age
in order that they might touch our insensibility. For since when
they could see and went about naked, neither by their age nor by
their misfortunes could they win favor of the unpitying, they added
to so great evils another yet sterner tragedy, that they might
remove their hunger; thinking it to be a lighter thing to be
deprived of this common light and that sunshine which is given to
all, than to struggle with continual famine and endure the most
miserable of deaths. Thus, since you have not learned to pity
poverty, but delight yourselves in misfortunes, they satisfy your
insatiable desire, and both for themselves and for us kindle a
fiercer flame in hell.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxii-p63">[9.] And to convince you that this is the reason
why these and such like things are done, I will tell you of an
acknowledged proof which no man can gainsay. There are other poor
men, of light and unsteady minds and not knowing how to bear
hunger, but rather enduring every thing than it. These having
often tried to deal with us by piteous gestures and words and
finding that they availed nothing, have left off those
supplications and henceforward our very wonder-workers are
surpassed by them, some chewing the skins of worn-out shoes, and
some fixing sharp nails into their heads, others lying about in
frozen pools with naked stomachs, and others enduring different
things yet more horrid than these, that they may draw around them
the ungodly spectators. And thou, while these things are going
on, standest laughing and wondering the while and making a fine
show of other men’s miseries, our common nature disgracing
itself. And what could a fierce demon do more? Next, you give
him money in abundance that he may do these things more promptly.
And to him that prays and calls on God and approaches with modesty,
you vouchsafe neither an answer nor a look: rather you utter to
him, continually teazing you, those disgusting expressions,
“Ought this fellow to live? or at all to breathe and see this
sun?” whereas to the other sort you are both cheerful and
liberal, as though you were appointed to dispense the prize of that
ridiculous and Satanic unseemliness. Wherefore with more
propriety to those who appoint these sports and bestow nothing till
they see others punishing themselves, might these words be
addressed, “Ought <pb n="124" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_124.html" id="iv.xxii-Page_124" />these men
to live, to breathe at all, or see the sun, who transgress against
our common nature, who insult God?” For whereas God saith,
“Give alms, and I give thee the kingdom of heaven,” thou
hearest not: but when the Devil shews thee a head pierced with
nails, on a sudden thou hast become liberal. And the contrivance
of the evil spirit pregnant with so much mischief, hath wrought
upon thee more than the promise of God bringing innumerable
blessings. If gold were to be laid down to prevent the doing of
these things or the looking upon them when done, there is nothing
which thou oughtest not to practise and endure, to get rid of so
excessive madness; but ye contrive every thing to have them done,
and look on the doing of them. Still askest thou then, tell me,
to what end is hell-fire? Nay, ask not that any more, but how is
there one hell only? For of how many punishments are not they
worthy, who get up this cruel and merciless spectacle and laugh at
what both they and yourselves ought to weep over; yea, rather of
the two, ye who compel them to such unseemly doings.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxii-p64">“But I do not compel them,” say you. What else
but compelling is it, I should like to know? Those who are more
modest and shed tears and invoke God, thou art impatient even of
listening to; but for these thou both findest silver in abundance
and bringest around thee many to admire them.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxii-p65">“Well, let us leave off,” say you,
“pitying them. And dost thou too enjoin this?” Nay, it is
not pity, O man, to demand so severe a punishment for a few pence,
to order men to maim themselves for necessary food and cut into
many pieces the skin of their head so mercilessly and pitifully.
“Gently,” say you, “for it is not we who pierce those
heads.” Would it were thou, and the horror would not be so
horrible. For he that slays a man does a much more grievous<note place="end" n="107" id="iv.xxii-p65.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxii-p66"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxii-p66.1">χαλεπώτερον</span>; the
sense seems to require “<i>less</i> grievous:” perhaps the
negative has slipped out of the text.</p></note> thing than
he who bids him slay himself, which indeed happens in the case of
these persons. For they endure more bitter pains when they are
bidden to be themselves the executors of these wicked
commands.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxii-p67">And all this in Antioch, where men were first called
Christians, wherein are bred the most civilized of mankind, where
in old time the fruit of charity flourished so abundantly. For
not only to those at hand but also to those very far off, they used
to send, and this when famine was expected.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxii-p68">[10.] What then ought we to do? say you. To
cease from this savage practice: and to convince all that are in
need that by doing these things they will gain nothing, but if they
modestly approach they shall find your liberality great. Let them
be once aware of this, even though they be of all men most
miserable, they will never choose to punish themselves so severely,
I pledge myself; nay, they will even give you thanks for delivering
them both from the mockery and the pain of that way of life. But
as it is, for charioteers you would let out even your own children,
and for dancers you would throw away your very souls, while for
Christ an hungered you spare not the smallest portion of your
substance. But if you give a little silver, you think as much of
it as if you had laid out all you have, not knowing that not the
giving but the giving liberally, this is true almsgiving.
Wherefore also it is not those simply who give whom the prophet
proclaims and calls happy, but those who bestow liberally. For he
doth not say simply, He hath given, but what? (<scripRef passage="Ps. cxii. 8" id="iv.xxii-p68.1" parsed="|Ps|112|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.112.8">Ps. cxii. 8</scripRef>.) “he hath dispersed abroad,
he hath given to the poor.” For what profit is it, when out of
it thou givest as it were a glass of water out of the sea, and even
a widow’s magnanimity is beyond thy emulation? And how wilt
thou say, “Pity me, O Lord, according to thy great pity, and
according to the multitude of thy mercies blot out my
transgression,” thyself not pitying according to any great pity,
nay, haply not according to any little. For I am greatly ashamed,
I own, when I see many of the rich riding upon their golden-bitted
chargers with a train of domestics clad in gold, and having couches
of silver and other and more pomp, and yet when there is need to
give to a poor man, becoming more beggarly than the very
poorest.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxii-p69">[11.] But what is their constant talk? “He
hath,” they say, “the common church-allowance.” And what is
that to thee? For thou wilt not be saved because I give; nor if
the Church bestow hast thou blotted out thine own sins. For this
cause givest thou not, because the Church ought to give to the
needy? Because the priests pray, wilt thou never pray thyself? 
And because others fast, wilt thou be continually drunken? 
Knowest thou not that God enacted not almsgiving so much for the
sake of the poor as for the sake of the persons themselves who
bestow?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxii-p70">But dost thou suspect the priest? Why this thing
itself, to begin with, is a grievous sin. However, I will not
examine the matter too nicely. Do thou it all in thine own
person, and so shalt thou reap a double reward. Since in fact,
what we say in behalf of almsgiving, we say not, that thou
shouldest offer to us, but that thou shouldest thyself minister by
thine own hands. For if thou bringest thine alms to me, perhaps
thou mayest even be led captive by vain-glory, and oftentimes
likewise thou shalt go away offended through suspicion of something
<pb n="125" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_125.html" id="iv.xxii-Page_125" />evil: but if ye do all things
by yourselves, ye shall both be rid of offences and of unreasonable
suspicion, and greater is your reward. Not therefore to compel
you to bring your money hither, do I say these things; nor from
indignation on account of the priests being ill-reported of. For
if one must be indignant and grieve, for you should be our grief,
who say this ill. Since to them who are spoken ill of falsely and
vainly the reward is greater, but to the speakers the condemnation
and punishment is heavier. I say not these things therefore in
their behalf, but in solicitude and care for you. For what marvel
is it if some in our generation are suspected, when in the case of
those holy men who imitated the angels, who possessed nothing of
their own, I mean the Apostles, there was a murmuring in the
ministration to the widows (<scripRef passage="Acts vi. 1" id="iv.xxii-p70.1" parsed="|Acts|6|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.6.1">Acts vi. 1</scripRef>.) that the poor were
overlooked? when “not one said that aught of the things he
possessed was his own, but they had all things common?” (<scripRef passage="Acts iv. 32" id="iv.xxii-p70.2" parsed="|Acts|4|32|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.4.32">Acts iv. 32</scripRef>.)</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxii-p71">Let us not then put forward these pretexts, nor
account it an excuse that the Church is wealthy. But when you see
the greatness of her substance, bear in mind also the crowds of
poor who are on her list, the multitudes of her sick, her occasions
of endless expenses. Investigate, scrutinize, there is none to
forbid, nay, they are even ready to give you an account. But I
wish to go much farther. Namely, when we have given in our
accounts and proved that our expenditure is no less than our
income, nay, sometimes more, I would gladly ask you this further
question: When we depart hence and shall hear Christ saying,
“Ye saw me hungry, and gave me no meat; naked, and ye clothed me
not;” what shall we say? what apology shall we make? Shall we
bring forward such and such a person who disobeyed these commands?
or some of the priests who were suspected? “Nay, what is this
to thee? for I accuse thee,” saith He, “of those things wherein
thou hast thyself sinned. And the apology for these would be, to
have washed away thine own offences, not to point to others whose
errors have been the same as thine.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxii-p72">In fact, the Church through your meanness is
compelled to have such property as it has now. Since, if men did
all things according to the apostolical laws, its revenue should
have been your good will, which were both a secure chest and an
inexhaustible treasury. But now when ye lay up for yourselves
treasures upon the earth and shut up all things in your own stores,
while the Church is compelled to be at charges with bands of
widows, choirs of virgins, sojournings of strangers, distresses of
foreigners, the misfortunes of prisoners, the necessities of the
sick and maimed, and other such like causes, what must be done? 
Turn away from all these, and block up so many ports? Who then
could endure the shipwrecks that would ensue; the weepings, the
lamentations, the wailings which would reach us from every
quarter?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxii-p73">Let us not then speak at random what comes into our
mind. For now, as I have just said, we are really prepared to
render up our accounts to you. But even if it were the reverse,
and ye had corrupt teachers plundering and grasping at every thing,
not even so were their wickedness an apology for you. For the
Lover of mankind and All-wise, the Only-Begotten Son of God, seeing
all things, and knowing the chance that in so great length of time
and in so vast a world there would be many corrupt priests; lest
the carelessness of those under their rule should increase through
their neglect, removing every excuse for indifference; “In
Moses’ seat,” saith He, “sit the Scribes and the Pharisees;
all things, therefore, whatsoever they bid you, these do ye, but do
not ye after their works:” implying, that even if thou hast a
bad teacher, this will not avail thee, shouldest thou not attend to
the things which are spoken. For not from what thy teacher hath
done but from what thou hast heard and disobeyed, from that, I say,
doth God pass his sentence upon thee. So that if thou doest the
things commanded, thou shalt then stand with much boldness: but
if thou disobey the things spoken, even though thou shouldest show
ten thousand corrupt priests, this will not plead for thee at
all. Since Judas also was an apostle, but nevertheless this shall
never be any apology for the sacrilegious and covetous. Nor will
any be able when accused to say, “Why the Apostle was a thief and
sacrilegious, and a traitor;” yea, this very thing shall most of
all be our punishment and condemnation that not even by the evils
of others were we corrected. For this cause also these things
were written that we might shun all emulation of such things.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxii-p74">Wherefore, leaving this person and that, let us take
heed to ourselves. For “each of us shall give account of
himself to God.” In order therefore that we may render up this
account with a good defence, let us well order our own lives and
stretch out a liberal hand to the needy, knowing that this only is
our defence, the showing ourselves to have rightly done the things
commanded; there is no other whatever. And if we be able to
produce this, we shall escape those intolerable pains of hell, and
obtain the good things to come; unto which may we all attain, by
the grace and mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ, with Whom, to the
Father and the Holy Ghost, be glory, power, and honor, now and
ever, and world without end. Amen.</p>

<p class="c27" id="iv.xxiii-p3">Know ye not that they which minister about sacred
things eat of the temple? and they which wait upon the altar have
their portion with the altar? Even so did the Lord ordain that
they which proclaim the Gospel should live of the Gospel.</p>

<p class="c24" id="iv.xxiii-p4"><span class="c18" id="iv.xxiii-p4.1">He</span> takes great care to show
that the receiving was not forbidden. Whereupon having said so
much before, he was not content but proceeds also to the Law,
furnishing an example closer to the point than the former. For it
was not the same thing to bring forward the oxen and to adduce the
law expressly given concerning priests.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiii-p5">But consider, I pray, in this also the wisdom of
Paul, how he mentions the matter in a way to give it dignity. For
he did not say, “They which minister about sacred things receive
of those who offer them.” But what? “They eat of the
temple:” so that neither they who receive may be blamed nor
they who give may be lifted up. Wherefore also what follows he
hath set down in the same way.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiii-p6">For neither did he say, “They which wait upon the
altar receive of them which sacrifice,” but, “have their
portion with the altar.” For the things offered now no longer
belonged to those who offered them, but to the temple and the
altar. And he said not, “They receive the holy things,” but,
they “eat of the temple,” indicating again their moderation,
and that it behoves them not to make money nor to be rich. And
though he say that they have their portion “with the altar,” he
doth not speak of equal distribution but of relief given them as
their due. And yet the case of the Apostles was much stronger.
For in the former instance the priesthood was an honor, but in the
latter it was dangers and slaughters and violent deaths.
Wherefore all the other examples together did not come up to the
saying, “If we sowed unto you spiritual things:” since in
saying, “we sowed,” he points out the storms, the danger, the
snares, the unspeakable evils, which they endured in preaching.
Nevertheless, though the superiority was so great, he was unwilling
either to abase the things of the old law or to exalt the things
which belong to himself: nay he even contracts his own, reckoning
the superiority not from the dangers, but from the greatness of the
gift. For he said not, “if we have jeoparded ourselves” or
“exposed ourselves to snares” but “if we sowed unto you
spiritual things.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiii-p7">And the part of the priests, as far as possible, he
exalts, saying, “They which minister about sacred things,” and
“they that wait upon the altar,” thereby intending to point out
their continual servitude and patience. Again, as he had spoken
of the priests among the Jews, viz. both the Levites and the Chief
Priests, so he hath expressed each of the orders, both the inferior
and the superior; the one by saying, “they which minister about
sacred things,” and the other by saying, “they which wait upon
the altar.” For not to all was one work commanded; but some
were entrusted with the coarser, others with the more exalted
offices. Comprehending therefore all these, lest any should say,
“why talk to us of the old law? knowest thou not that ours is the
time of more perfect commandments?” after all those topics he
placed that which is strongest of all, saying,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiii-p8"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 9.14" id="iv.xxiii-p8.1" parsed="|1Cor|9|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.9.14">Ver. 14</scripRef>. “Even so did the Lord
ordain that they who proclaim the Gospel should live of the
Gospel.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiii-p9">Nor doth he even here say that they are supported by
men, but as in the case of the priests, of “the temple” and
“of the altar,” so likewise here, “of the Gospel;” and as
there he saith, “eat,” so here, “live,” not make
merchandize nor lay up treasures. “For the laborer,” saith
He, “is worthy of his hire.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiii-p10">[2.] <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 9.15" id="iv.xxiii-p10.1" parsed="|1Cor|9|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.9.15">Ver. 15</scripRef>. “But I have used none of
these things:”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiii-p11">What then if thou hast not used them now, saith one,
but intendest to use them at a future time, and on this account
sayest these things. Far from it; for he speedily corrected the
notion, thus saying;</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiii-p12">“And I write not these things that it may be so
done in my case.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiii-p13">And see with what vehemence he disavows and repels
the thing:</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiii-p14">“For it were good for me rather to die, than that
any man should make my glorying void.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiii-p15">And not once nor twice, but many times he uses this
expression. For above he said, “We 
<pb n="127" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_127.html" id="iv.xxiii-Page_127" />did not use this right:” and after this
again, “that I abuse not my right:” and here, “but I have
used none of these things.” “These things;” what things? 
The many examples.<note place="end" n="108" id="iv.xxiii-p15.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxiii-p16"> [Better, “None of these preogatives,”
such as freedom from restrictions as to food, freedom to marry, and
authority to claim maintenance from the churches. Edwards <i>in
lo</i>. C.]</p></note>  That is to say, many things
giving me license; the soldier, the husbandman, the shepherd, the
Apostles, the law, the things done by us unto you, the things done
by you unto the others, the priests, the ordinance of Christ; by
none of these have I been induced to abolish my own law, and to
receive. And speak not to me of the past: (although I could
say, that I have endured much even in past times on this account,)
nevertheless I do not rest on it alone, but likewise concerning the
future I pledge myself, that I would choose rather to die of hunger
than be deprived of these crowns.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiii-p17">“For it were good for me rather to die,” saith
he, “than that any man should make my glorying void.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiii-p18">He said not, “that any man should abolish my
law,” but, “my glorying.” For lest any should say, “he
doth it indeed but not cheerfully, but with lamentation and
grief,” willing to show the excess of his joy and the abundance
of his zeal, he even calls the matter “glorying.” So far was
he from vexing himself that he even glories, and chooses rather to
die than to fall from this “glorying.” So much dearer to him
even than life itself was that proceeding of his.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiii-p19">[3.] Next, he exalts it from another consideration
also, and signifies that it was a great thing, not that he might
show himself famous, (for far was he from that disposition,) but to
signify that he rejoices, and with a view more abundantly to take
away all suspicion. For on this account, as I before said, he
also called it a glorying: and what saith he?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiii-p20"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 9.16-18" id="iv.xxiii-p20.1" parsed="|1Cor|9|16|9|18" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.9.16-1Cor.9.18">Ver. 16, 17, 18</scripRef>. “For if I preach the
Gospel, I have nothing to glory of; for necessity is laid upon me;
for woe is unto me, if I preach not the Gospel!  For if I do this
of mine own will, I have a reward: but if not of mine own will, I
have a stewardship entrusted to me. What then is my reward? 
That when I preach the Gospel, I may make the Gospel of Christ
without charge, so as not to use to the full my right in the
Gospel.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiii-p21">What sayest thou? tell me. “If thou preach the
Gospel, it is nothing for thee to glory of, but it is, if thou make
the Gospel of Christ without charge?” Is this therefore greater
than that? By no means; but in another point of view it hath some
advantage, inasmuch as the one is a command, but the other is a
good deed of my own free-will: for what things are done beyond
the commandment, have a great reward in this respect: but such as
are in pursuance of a commandment, not so great: and so in this
respect he says, the one is more than the other; not in the very
nature of the thing. For what is equal to preaching; since it
maketh men vie even with the angels themselves. Nevertheless
since the one is a commandment and a debt, the other a forwardness
of free-will, in this respect this is more than that. Wherefore
he saith, explaining the same, what I just now mentioned:</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiii-p22">“For if I do this of mine own will, I have a
reward, but if not of mine own will, a stewardship is entrusted to
me;” taking the words of mine own “will” and “not of mine
own will,” of its being committed or not committed to him. And
thus we must understand the expression, “for necessity is laid
upon me;” not as though he did aught of these things against his
will, God forbid, but as though he were bound by the things
commanded, and for contradistinction to the liberty in receiving
before mentioned. Wherefore also Christ said to the disciples,
(St. <scripRef passage="Luke xvii. 10" id="iv.xxiii-p22.1" parsed="|Luke|17|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.17.10">Luke xvii. 10</scripRef>.) “When ye have done all,
say, We are unprofitable servants; for we have done that which was
our duty to do.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiii-p23">“What then is my reward? That when I preach the
Gospel, I may make the Gospel without charge.” What then, tell
me, hath Peter no reward? Nay, who can ever have so great an one
as he? And what shall we say of the other Apostles? How then
said he, “If I do this of mine own will I have a reward, but if
not of mine own will, a stewardship is entrusted to me?” Seest
thou here also his wisdom? For he said not, “But if not of mine
own will,” I have no reward, but, “a stewardship is committed
unto me:” implying that even thus he hath a reward, but such as
he obtains who hath performed what was commanded, not such as
belongs to him who hath of his own resources been generous and
exceeded the commandment.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiii-p24">“What then is the reward? That, when I
preach the Gospel,” saith he, “I may make the Gospel without
charge, so as not to use to the full my right in the Gospel.”
See how throughout he uses the term “right,” intimating this,
as I have often observed; that neither are they who receive worthy
of blame. But he added, “in the Gospel,” partly to show the
reasonableness of it, partly also to forbid our carrying the matter
out into every case. For the teacher ought to receive, but not
the mere drone also.<note place="end" n="109" id="iv.xxiii-p24.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxiii-p25"> [Chrysostom’s view of this difficult passage
appears to be: “If my preaching the Gospel is an optional
thing, I have a reward; if on the other hand it is not optional but
obligatory, then reward is out of the question (<scripRef passage="Luke xvii. 10" id="iv.xxiii-p25.1" parsed="|Luke|17|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.17.10">Luke xvii. 10</scripRef>). But it is obligatory in my
case, and yet I have a reward, viz. the privilege of preaching
gratuitously.” This is one of Paul’s felicitous paradoxes.
“The consciousness of preaching freely a free Gospel was his pay
for declining to be paid.” C.]</p></note></p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiii-p26"><pb n="128" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_128.html" id="iv.xxiii-Page_128" />[4.] <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 9.19" id="iv.xxiii-p26.1" parsed="|1Cor|9|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.9.19">Ver.
19</scripRef>. “For though I was
free from all men, I brought myself under bondage to all, that I
might gain the more.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiii-p27">Here again he introduces another high step in
advance. For a great thing it is even not to receive, but this
which he is about to mention is much more than that. What then is
it that he says? “Not only have I not received,” saith he,”
not only have I not used this right, but I have even made myself a
slave, and in a slavery manifold and universal. For not in money
alone, but, which was much more than money, in employments many and
various have I made good this same rule: and I have made myself a
slave when I was subject to none, having no necessity in any
respect, (for this is the meaning of, “though I was free from all
men;”) and not to any single person have I been a slave, but to
the whole world.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiii-p28">Wherefore also he subjoined, “I brought myself
under bondage to all.” That is, “To preach the Gospel I was
commanded, and to proclaim the things committed to my trust; but
the contriving and devising numberless things beside, all that was
of my own zeal. For I was only under obligation to invest the
money, whereas I did every thing in order to get a return for it,
attempting more than was commanded.” Thus doing as he did all
things of free choice and zeal and love to Christ, he had an
insatiable desire for the salvation of mankind. Wherefore also he
used to overpass by a very great deal the lines marked out, in
every way springing higher than the very heaven.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiii-p29">[5.] Next, having mentioned his servitude, he
describes in what follows the various modes of it. And what are
these?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiii-p30"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 9.20" id="iv.xxiii-p30.1" parsed="|1Cor|9|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.9.20">Ver. 20</scripRef>. “And I became,” says
he, “to the Jews as a Jew, that I might gain Jews.” And how
did this take place? When he circumcised that he might abolish
circumcision. Wherefore he said not, “a Jew,” but, “as a
Jew,” which was a wise arrangement. What sayest thou? The
herald of the world and he who touched the very heavens and shone
so bright in grace, doth he all at once descend so low? Yea.
For this is to ascend. For you are not to look to the fact only
of his descending, but also to his raising up him that was bowed
down and bringing him up to himself.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiii-p31">“To them that are under the law, as under the law,
not being myself under the law, that I might gain them that are
under the law.” Either it is the explanation of what went
before, or he hints at some other thing besides the former: 
calling those Jews, who were such originally and from the first: 
but “under the law,” the proselytes, or those who became
believers and yet adhered to the law. For they were no longer as
Jews, yet ‘under the law.’ And when was he under the law? 
When he shaved his head; when he offered sacrifice.  Now these
things were done, not because his mind changed, (since such conduct
would have been wickedness,) but because his love condescended.
For that he might bring over to this faith those who were really
Jews, he became such himself not really, showing himself such only,
but not such in fact nor doing these things from a mind so
disposed. Indeed, how could he, zealous as he was to convert
others also, and doing these things only in order that he might
free others who did them from that degradation?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiii-p32"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 9.21" id="iv.xxiii-p32.1" parsed="|1Cor|9|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.9.21">Ver. 21</scripRef>. “To them that are without
law, as without law.” These were neither Jews, nor Christians,
nor Greeks; but ‘outside of the Law,’ as was Cornelius, and if
there were any others like him. For among these also making his
appearance, he used to assume many of their ways. But some say
that he hints at his discourse with the Athenians from the
inscription on the altar, and that so he saith, “to them that are
without law, as without law.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiii-p33">Then, lest any should think that the matter was a
change of mind, he added, “not being without law to God, but
under law to Christ;” i.e., “so far from being without law, I
am not simply under the Law, but I have that law which is much more
exalted than the older one, viz. that of the Spirit and of
grace.” Wherefore also he adds, “to Christ.” Then again,
having made them confident of his judgment, he states also the gain
of such condescension, saying, “that I might gain them that are
without law.” And every where he brings forward the cause of
his condescension, and stops not even here, but says,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiii-p34"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 9.22" id="iv.xxiii-p34.1" parsed="|1Cor|9|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.9.22">Ver. 22</scripRef>. “To the weak became I
weak, that I might gain the weak:” in this part coming to their
case, with a view to which also all these things have been
spoken. However, those were much greater things, but this more to
the purpose; whence also he hath placed it after them. Indeed he
did the same thing likewise in his Epistle to the Romans, when he
was finding fault about meats; and so in many other places.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiii-p35">Next, not to waste time by naming all severally, he
saith, “I am become all things to all men, that I may by all
means save some.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiii-p36">Seest thou how far it is carried? “I am
become all things to all men,” not expecting, however, to save
all, but that I may save though it be but a few. And so great
care and service have I undergone, as one naturally would who was
about saving all, far however from hoping to gain all: which was
truly magnanimous<note place="end" n="110" id="iv.xxiii-p36.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxiii-p37"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxiii-p37.1">πολὺ μέγα</span>.</p></note> <pb n="129" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_129.html" id="iv.xxiii-Page_129" />and a proof of burning zeal. Since
likewise the sower sowed every where, and saved not all the seed,
notwithstanding he did his part. And having mentioned the fewness
of those who are saved, again, adding, “by all means,” he
consoled those to whom this was a grief. For though it be not
possible that all the seed should be saved, nevertheless it cannot
be that all should perish. Wherefore he said, “by all means,”
because one so ardently zealous must certainly have some
success.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiii-p38"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 9.23" id="iv.xxiii-p38.1" parsed="|1Cor|9|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.9.23">Ver. 23</scripRef>. “And I do all things for
the Gospel’s sake, that I may be a joint partaker thereof.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiii-p39">“That is, that I may seem also myself to have
added some contribution of mine own, and may partake of the crowns
laid up for the faithful. For as he spake of “living of the
Gospel,” i.e., of the believers; so also here, “that I may be a
joint partaker in the Gospel, that I may be able to partake with
them that have believed in the Gospel.” Do you perceive his
humility, how in the recompense of rewards he places himself as one
of the many, though he had exceeded all in his labors? whence it is
evident that he would in his reward also. Nevertheless, he claims
not to enjoy the first prize, but is content if so be he may
partake with the others in the crowns laid up for them. But these
things he said, not because he did this for any reward, but that
hereby at least he might draw them on, and by these hopes might
induce them to do all things for their brethren’s sake. Seest
thou his wisdom!  Seest thou the excellency of his perfection? how
he wrought beyond the things commanded, not receiving when it was
lawful to receive. Seest thou the exceeding greatness of his
condescension? how he that was “under law to Christ,” and kept
that highest law, “to them that were without law,” was “as
one without law,” to the Jews, as a Jew, in either kind showing
himself preeminent, and surpassing all.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiii-p40">[6.] This also do thou, and think not being
eminent, that thou lowerest thyself, when for thy brother’s sake
thou submittest to some abasement. For this is not to fall, but
to descend. For he who falls, lies prostrate, hardly to be raised
up again; but he who descends shall also rise again with much
advantage. As also Paul descended indeed alone, but ascended with
the whole world: not acting a part, for he would not have sought
the gain of them that are saved had he been acting. Since the
hypocrite seeks men’s perdition, and feigns, that he may receive,
not that he may give. But the apostle not so: as a physician
rather, as a teacher, as a father, the one to the sick, the other
to the disciple, the third to the son, condescends for his
correction, not for his hurt; so likewise did he.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiii-p41">To show that the things which have been stated were
not pretence; in a case where he is not compelled to do or say any
such thing but means to express his affection and his confidence;
hear him saying, (<scripRef passage="Rom. viii. 39" id="iv.xxiii-p41.1" parsed="|Rom|8|39|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.8.39">Rom.
viii. 39</scripRef>.) “neither
life, nor death, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor
things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any
other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God
which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.” Seest thou a love more
ardent than fire? So let us also love Christ. For indeed it is
easy, if we will. For neither was the Apostle such by nature.
On this account, you see, his former life was recorded, so contrary
to this, that we may learn that the work is one of choice, and that
to the willing all things are easy.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiii-p42">Let us not then despair, but even though thou be a
reviler, or covetous, or whatsoever thou art, consider that Paul
was (<scripRef passage="1 Tim. 13, 16" id="iv.xxiii-p42.1" parsed="|1Tim|13|0|0|0;|1Tim|16|0|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.13 Bible:1Tim.16">1 Tim. 13, 16</scripRef>.) “a blasphemer, and
persecutor, and injurious, and the chief of sinners,” and
suddenly rose to the very summit of virtue, and his former life
proved no hindrance to him. And yet none with so great frenzy
clings to vice as he did to the war against the Church. For at
that time he put his very life into it; and because he had not ten
thousand hands that he might stone Stephen with all of them, he was
vexed. Notwithstanding, even thus he found how he might stone him
with more hands, to wit, those of the false witnesses whose clothes
he kept. And again, when he entered into houses like a wild beast
and no otherwise did he rush in, haling, tearing men and women,
filling all things with tumult and confusion and innumerable
conflicts. For instance, so terrible was he that the Apostles,
(<scripRef passage="Acts ix. 26" id="iv.xxiii-p42.2" parsed="|Acts|9|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.9.26">Acts ix. 26</scripRef>.) even after his most glorious
change, did not yet venture to join themselves to him.
Nevertheless, after all those things he became such as he was: 
for I need not say more.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiii-p43">[7.] Where now are they who build up the necessity
of fate against the freedom of the will? Let them hear these
things, and let their mouths be stopped. For there is nothing to
hinder him that willeth to become good, even though before he
should be one of the vilest. And in fact we are more aptly
disposed that way, inasmuch as virtue is agreeable to our nature,
and vice contrary to it, even as sickness and health. For God
hath given us eyes, not that we may look wantonly, but that,
admiring his handi-work, we may worship the Creator. And that
this is the use of our eyes is evident from the things which are
seen. For the lustre of the sun and of the sky we see from an
immeasurable distance, but a woman’s beauty one cannot discern so
far off. Seest thou that for this end our eye was chiefly
given? Again, he made the ear that 
<pb n="130" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_130.html" id="iv.xxiii-Page_130" />we should entertain not blasphemous words, but
saving doctrines. Wherefore you see, when it receives any thing
dissonant, both our soul shudders and our very body also.
“For,” saith one, (<scripRef passage="Ecclesiasticus 27.5" id="iv.xxiii-p43.1" parsed="|Sir|27|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Sir.27.5">Ecclus. xxvii. 5</scripRef>.) “the talk of him that
sweareth much maketh the hair stand upright.” And if we hear
any thing cruel or merciless, again our flesh creeps; but if any
thing decorous and kind, we even exult and rejoice. Again, if our
mouth utter base words, it causes us to be ashamed and hide
ourselves, but if grave words, it utters them with ease and all
freedom. Now for those things which are according to nature no
one would blush, but for those which are against nature. And the
hands when they steal hide themselves, and seek excuses; but if
they give alms, they even glory. So that if we will, we have from
every side a great inclination towards virtue. But if thou talk
to me of the pleasure which arises from vice, consider that this
also is a thing which we reap more of from virtue. For to have a
good conscience and to be looked up to by all and to entertain good
hopes, is of all things most pleasant to him that hath seen into
the nature of pleasure, even as the reverse is of all things the
most grievous to him that knows the nature of pain; such as to be
reproached by all, to be accused by our own conscience, to tremble
and fear both at the future and the present.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiii-p44">And that what I say may become more evident, let us
suppose for argument’s sake one man having a wife, yet defiling
the marriage-bed of his neighbor and taking pleasure in this wicked
robbery, enjoying his paramour. Then let us again oppose to him
another who loves his own spouse. And that the victory may be
greater and more evident, let the man who enjoys his own wife only,
have a fancy also for the other, the adulteress, but restrain his
passion and do nothing evil: (although neither is this pure
chastity.) However, granting more than is necessary, that you may
convince yourself how great is the pleasure of virtue, for this
cause have we so framed our story.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiii-p45">Now then, having brought them together, let us ask
them accordingly, whose is the pleasanter life: and you will hear
the one glorying and exulting in the conquest over his lust: but
the other—or rather, there is no need to wait to be informed of
any thing by him. For thou shalt see him, though he deny it times
without number, more wretched than men in a prison. For he fears
and suspects all, both his own wife and the husband of the
adulteress and the adulteress herself, and domestics, and friends,
and kinsmen, and walls, and shadows, and himself, and what is worst
of all, he hath his conscience crying out against him, barking
aloud every day. But if he should also bring to mind the
judgment-seat of God, he will not be able even to stand. And the
pleasure is short: but the pain from it unceasing. For both at
even, and in the night, in the desert and the city and every where,
the accuser haunts him, pointing to a sharpened sword and the
intolerable punishment, and with that terror consuming and wasting
him. But the other, the chaste person, is free from all these
things, and is at liberty, and with comfort looks upon his wife,
his children, his friends, and meets all with unembarrassed eyes.
Now if he that is enamored but is master of himself enjoy so great
pleasure, he that indulges no such passion but is truly chaste,
what harbor, what calm will be so sweet and serene as the mind
which he will attain? And on this account you may see few
adulterers but many chaste persons. But if the former were the
pleasanter, it would be preferred by the greater number. And tell
me not of the terror of the laws. For this is not that which
restrains them, but the excessive unreasonableness, and the fact
that the pains of it are more than the pleasures, and the sentence
of conscience.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiii-p46">[8.] Such then is the adulterer. Now, if you
please, let us bring before you the covetous, laying bare again
another lawless passion. For him too we shall see afraid of the
same things and unable to enjoy real pleasure: in that calling to
mind both those whom he hath wronged, and those who sympathize with
them, and the public sentence of all concerning himself, he hath
ten thousand agitations.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiii-p47">And this is not his only vexation, but not even his
beloved object can he enjoy. For such is the way of the covetous;
not that they may enjoy do they possess, but that they may not
enjoy. But if this seem to thee a riddle, hear next what is yet
worse than this and more perplexing; that not in this way only are
they deprived of the pleasure of their goods, by their not
venturing to use them as they would, but also by their never being
filled with them but living in a continual thirst: than which
what can be more grievous? But the just man is not so, but is
delivered both from trembling and hatred and fear and this
incurable thirst: and as all men curse the one, even so do all
men conspire to bless the other: and as the one hath no friend,
so hath the other no enemy.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiii-p48">What now, these things being so acknowledged, can be
more unpleasing than vice or more pleasant than virtue? Nay,
rather, though we should speak for ever, no one shall be able to
represent in discourse either the pain of this, or the pleasure of
the other, until we shall experience it. For then shall we find
vice more bitter than gall, when we shall have fully tasted the
honey of virtue. Not but vice is even now unpleasant, and
disgusting, and burdensome, <pb n="131" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_131.html" id="iv.xxiii-Page_131" />and
this not even her very votaries gainsay; but when we withdraw from
her, then do we more clearly discern the bitterness of her
commands. But if the multitude run to her, it is no marvel; since
children also oftentimes, choosing things less pleasant, despise
those which are more delightful and the sick for a momentary
gratification lose the perpetual and more certain joy. But this
comes of the weakness and folly of those who are possessed with any
fondness, not of the nature of the things. For it is the virtuous
man who lives in pleasure; he who is rich indeed and free
indeed.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiii-p49">But if any one would grant the rest to
virtue,—liberty, security, freedom from cares, the fearing no
man, the suspecting no man,—but would not grant it pleasure; to
laugh, and that heartily, occurs to me, I confess, as the only
course to be taken. For what else is pleasure, but freedom from
care and fear and despondency, and the not being under the power of
any? And who is in pleasure, tell me, the man in frenzy and
convulsion, who is goaded by divers lusts, and is not even himself;
or he who is freed from all these waves, and is settled in the love
of wisdom, as it were in a harbor? Is it not evident, the
latter? But this would seem to be a thing peculiar to virtue.
So that vice hath merely the name of pleasure, but of the substance
it is destitute. And before the enjoyment, it is madness, not
pleasure: but after the enjoyment, straightway this also is
extinguished. Now then if neither at the beginning nor afterwards
can one discern the pleasure of it, when will it appear, and
where?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiii-p50">And that thou mayest more clearly understand what I
say, let us try the force of the argument in an example. Now
consider. One is enamored of a fair and lovely woman: this man
as long as he cannot obtain his desire is like unto men beside
themselves and frantic; but after that he hath obtained it, he hath
quenched his appetite. If therefore neither at the beginning doth
he feel pleasure, (for the affair is madness,) nor in the end, (for
by the indulgence of his lust he cools down his wild fancy,) where
after all are we to find it? But our doings are not such, but
both at the beginning they are freed from all disturbance, and to
the end the pleasure remains in its bloom: nay rather there is no
end of our pleasure, nor have our good things a limit, nor is this
pleasure ever done away.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiii-p51">Upon all these considerations, then, if we love
pleasure, let us lay hold on virtue that we may win good things
both now and hereafter: unto which may we all attain, through the
grace and mercy, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="c27" id="iv.xxiv-p3">Know ye not that they which run in a race run all,
but one receiveth the prize?</p>

<p class="c24" id="iv.xxiv-p4"><span class="c18" id="iv.xxiv-p4.1">Having</span> pointed out the
manifold usefulness of condescension and that this is the highest
perfectness, and that he himself having risen higher than all
towards perfection, or rather having gone beyond it by declining to
receive, descended lower than all again; and having made known to
us the times for each of these, both for the perfectness and for
the condescension; he touches them more sharply in what follows,
covertly intimating that this which was done by them and which was
counted a mark of perfectness, is a kind of superfluous and useless
labor. And he saith it not thus out clearly, lest they should
become insolent; but the methods of proof employed by him makes
this evident.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiv-p5">And having said that they sin against Christ and
destroy the brethren, and are nothing profited by this perfect
knowledge, except charity be added; he again proceeds to a common
example, and saith,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiv-p6">“Know ye not that they which run in a race run
all, but one receiveth the prize?” Now this he saith, not as
though here also one only out of many would be saved; far from it;
but to set forth the exceeding diligence which it is our duty to
use. For as there, though many descend into the course not many
are crowned, but this befalls one only; and it is not enough to
descend into the contest, nor to anoint one’s self and wrestle: 
so likewise here it is not sufficient to believe, and to contend in
any way; but unless we have so run as unto the end to show
ourselves unblameable, and to come near the prize, it will profit
us nothing. For even though thou consider thyself to be perfect
according to knowledge, thou hast not yet attained the whole; which
hinting at, he said, <pb n="132" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_132.html" id="iv.xxiv-Page_132" />“so run,
that ye may obtain.” They had not then yet, as it seems,
attained. And having said thus, he teaches them also the
manner.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiv-p7"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 9.25" id="iv.xxiv-p7.1" parsed="|1Cor|9|25|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.9.25">Ver. 25</scripRef>. “And every man that
striveth in the games is temperate in all things.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiv-p8">What is, “all things?” He doth not abstain
from one and err in another, but he masters entirely gluttony and
lasciviousness and drunkenness and all his passions. “For
this,” saith he, “takes place even in the heathen games. For
neither is excess of wine permitted to those who contend at the
time of the contest, nor wantonness, lest they should weaken their
vigor, nor yet so much as to be busied about any thing else, but
separating themselves altogether from all things they apply
themselves to their exercise only.” Now if there these things
be so where the crown falls to one, much more here, where the
incitement in emulation is more abundant. For here neither is one
to be crowned alone, and the rewards also far surpass the labors.
Wherefore also he puts it so as to shame them, saying, “Now they
do it receive to a corruptible crown, but we an
incorruptible.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiv-p9">[2.] <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 9.26" id="iv.xxiv-p9.1" parsed="|1Cor|9|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.9.26">Ver. 26</scripRef>. “I therefore so run, as
not uncertainly.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiv-p10">Thus having shamed them from those that are without,
he next brings forward himself also, which kind of thing is a most
excellent method of teaching: and accordingly we find him every
where doing so.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiv-p11">But what is, “not uncertainly?” “Looking to
some mark,” saith he, “not at random and in vain, as ye do.
For what profit have ye of entering into idol-temples, and
exhibiting for-sooth that perfectness? None. But not such am I,
but all things whatsoever I do, I do for the salvation of my
neighbor. Whether I show forth perfectness, it is for their sake;
or condescension, for their sake again: whether I surpass Peter
in declining to receive [compensation], it is that they may not be
offended; or descend lower than all, being circumcised and shaving
my head, it is that they may not be subverted. This is, “not
uncertainly.” But thou, why dost thou eat in idol-temples, tell
me? Nay, thou canst not assign any reasonable cause. For
“meat commendeth thee not to God; neither if thou eat art thou
the better, nor if thou eat not art thou the worse.” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. viii. 8" id="iv.xxiv-p11.1" parsed="|1Cor|8|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.8.8">1 Cor. viii. 8</scripRef>.) Plainly then thou runnest
at random: for this is, “uncertainly.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiv-p12">“So fight I, as not beating the air.” This he
saith, again intimating that he acted not at random nor in vain.
“For I have one at whom I may strike, i.e., the devil. But thou
dost not strike him, but simply throwest away thy strength.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiv-p13">Now so far then, altogether bearing with them, he
thus speaks. For since he had dealt somewhat vehemently with them
in the preceding part, he now on the contrary keeps back his
rebuke, reserving for the end of the discourse the deep wound of
all. Since here he says that they act at random and in vain; but
afterwards signifies that it is at the risk of no less than utter
ruin to their own soul, and that even apart from all injury to
their brethren, neither are they themselves guiltless in daring so
to act.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiv-p14"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 9.27" id="iv.xxiv-p14.1" parsed="|1Cor|9|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.9.27">Ver. 27</scripRef>. “But I buffet my body,
and bring it into bondage lest by any means, after that I have
preached to others, I myself should be rejected.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiv-p15">Here he implies that they are subject to the lust of
the belly and give up the reins to it, and under a pretence of
perfection fulfil their own greediness; a thought which before also
he was travailing to express, when he said, “meats for the belly,
and the belly for meats.” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. vi. 13" id="iv.xxiv-p15.1" parsed="|1Cor|6|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.6.13">1 Cor. vi. 13</scripRef>.) For since both fornication
is caused by luxury, and it also brought forth idolatry, he
naturally oftentimes inveighs against this disease; and pointing
out how great things he suffered for the Gospel, he sets this also
down among them. “As I went,” saith he, “beyond the
commands, and this when it was no light matter for me:” (“for
we endure all things,” it is said,) “so also here I submit to
much labor in order to live soberly. Stubborn as appetite is and
the tyranny of the belly, nevertheless I bridle it and give not
myself up to the passion, but endure all labor not to be drawn
aside by it.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiv-p16">“For do not, I pray you, suppose that by
taking things easily I arrive at this desirable result. For it is
a race and a manifold struggle,<note place="end" n="111" id="iv.xxiv-p16.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxiv-p17"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxiv-p17.1">παγκράτιον</span>.</p></note> and a tyrannical nature continually
rising up against me and seeking to free itself. But I bear not
with it but keep it down, and bring it into subjection with many
struggles.” Now this he saith that none may despairingly
withdraw from the conflicts in behalf of virtue because the
undertaking is laborious. Wherefore he saith, “I buffet and
bring into bondage.” He said not, “I kill:” nor, “I
punish” for the flesh is not to be hated, but, “I buffet and
bring into bondage;” which is the part of a master not of an
enemy, of a teacher not of a foe, of a gymnastic master not of an
adversary.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiv-p18">“Lest by any means, having preached to others, I
myself should be a rejected.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiv-p19">Now if Paul feared this who had taught so many, and
feared it after his preaching and becoming an angel and undertaking
the leadership of the whole world; what can we say?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiv-p20">For, “think not,” saith he, “because ye have
believed, that this is sufficient for your salvation: since if to
me neither preaching nor 
<pb n="133" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_133.html" id="iv.xxiv-Page_133" />teaching nor bringing over innumerable persons,
is enough for salvation unless I exhibit my own conduct also
unblameable, much less to you.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiv-p21">[3.] Then he comes to other illustrations again.
And as above he alleged the examples of the Apostles and those of
common custom and those of the priests, and his own, so also here
having set forth those of the Olympic games and those of his own
course, he again proceeds to the histories of the Old Testament.
And because what he has to say will be somewhat unpleasing he makes
his exhortation general, and discourses not only concerning the
subject before him, but also generally concerning all the evils
among the Corinthians. And in the case of the heathen games,
“Know ye not?” saith he: but here,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiv-p22"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 10.1" id="iv.xxiv-p22.1" parsed="|1Cor|10|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.10.1">Chap. x. ver. 1</scripRef>. “For I would not,
brethren, have you ignorant.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiv-p23">Now this he said, implying that they were not very
well instructed in these things. And what is this which thou
wouldest not have us ignorant of?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiv-p24"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 10.1-5" id="iv.xxiv-p24.1" parsed="|1Cor|10|1|10|5" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.10.1-1Cor.10.5">Ver. 1</scripRef>–5. “That our fathers,” saith he,
“were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea; and
were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea; and did
all eat the same spiritual meat; and did all drink the same
spiritual drink; for they drank of a spiritual Rock that followed
them: and the Rock was Christ. Howbeit with most of them God
was not well pleased.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiv-p25">And wherefore saith he these things? To point out
that as they were nothing profited by the enjoyment of so great a
gift, so neither these by obtaining Baptism and partaking of
spiritual Mysteries, except they go on and show forth a life worthy
of this grace. Wherefore also he introduces the types both of
Baptism and of the Mysteries.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiv-p26">But what is, “They were baptized into Moses?”
Like as we, on our belief in Christ and His resurrection, are
baptized, as being destined in our own persons to partake in the
same mysteries; for, “we are baptized,” saith he, “for the
dead,” i.e., for our own bodies; even so they putting confidence
in Moses, i.e., having seen him cross first, ventured also
themselves into the waters. But because he wishes to bring the
Type near the Truth; he speaks it not thus, but uses the terms of
the Truth even concerning the Type.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiv-p27">Further: this was a symbol of the Font, and that
which follows, of the Holy Table. For as thou eatest the Lord’s
Body, so they the manna: and as thou drinkest the Blood, so they
water from a rock. For though they were things of sense which
were produced, yet were they spiritually exhibited, not according
to the order of nature, but according to the gracious intention of
the gift, and together with the body nourished also the soul,
leading it unto faith. On this account, you see, touching the
food he made no remark, for it was entirely different, not in mode
only but in nature also; (for it was manna;) but respecting the
drink, since the manner only of the supply was extraordinary and
required proof, therefore having said that “they drank the same
spiritual drink,” he added, “for they drank of a spiritual Rock
that followed them,” and he subjoined, “and the Rock was
Christ.” For it was not the nature of the rock which sent forth
the water, (such is his meaning,) else would it as well have gushed
out before this time: but another sort of Rock, a spiritual One,
performed the whole, even Christ who was every where with them and
wrought all the wonders. For on this account he said, “that
followed them.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiv-p28">Perceivest thou the wisdom of Paul, how in both
cases he points cut Him as the Giver, and thereby brings the Type
nigh to the Truth? “For He who set those things before them,”
saith he, “the same also hath prepared this our Table: and the
same Person both brought them through the sea and thee through
Baptism; and before them set manna, but before thee His Body and
Blood.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiv-p29">[4.] As touching His gift then, such is the
case: now let us observe also what follows, and consider, whether
when they showed themselves unworthy of the gift, He spared them.
Nay, this thou canst not say. Wherefore also he added, “Howbeit
with most of them God was not well-pleased;” although He had
honored them with so great honor. Yea, it profited them nothing,
but most of them perished. The truth is, they all perished, but
that he might not seem to prophesy total destruction to these also,
therefore he said, “most of them.” And yet they were
innumerable, but their number profited them nothing: and these
were all so many tokens of love; but not even did this profit them,
inasmuch as they did not themselves show forth the fruits of
love.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiv-p30">Thus, since most men disbelieve the things said of
hell, as not being present nor in sight; he alleges the things
heretofore done as a proof that God doth punish all who sin, even
though He have bestowed innumerable benefits upon them: “for if
ye disbelieve the things to come,” so he speaks, “yet surely
the things that are past ye will not disbelieve.” Consider, for
example, how great benefits He bestowed on them: from Egypt and
the slavery there He set them free, the sea He made their path,
from heaven he brought down manna, from beneath He sent forth
strange and marvellous fountains of waters; He was with them every
where, <pb n="134" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_134.html" id="iv.xxiv-Page_134" />doing wonders and
fencing them in on every side: nevertheless since they showed
forth nothing worthy of this gift, He spared them not, but
destroyed them all.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiv-p31"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 10.5" id="iv.xxiv-p31.1" parsed="|1Cor|10|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.10.5">Ver. 5</scripRef>.
“For they were overthrown,” saith he, “in the
wilderness.” Declaring by this word both the sweeping
destruction, and the punishments and the vengeance inflicted by
God, and that they did not so much as attain to the rewards
proposed to them.  Neither were they in the land of promise when
He did these things unto them, but without and afar somewhere, and
wide of that country; He thus visiting them with a double
vengeance, both by not permitting them to see the land, and this
too though promised unto them, and also by actual severe
punishment.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiv-p32">And what are these things to us? say you. To thee
surely they belong. Wherefore also he adds,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiv-p33"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 10.6" id="iv.xxiv-p33.1" parsed="|1Cor|10|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.10.6">Ver. 6</scripRef>. “Now these things
were figures of us<note place="end" n="112" id="iv.xxiv-p33.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxiv-p34"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxiv-p34.1">τύποι ἡμῶν</span>, rec.
vers. <i>our examples</i>.</p></note>.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiv-p35">For as the gifts are figures, even so are the
punishments figures: and as Baptism and the Table were sketched
out prophetically, so also by what ensued, the certainty of
punishment coming on those who are unworthy of this gift was
proclaimed beforehand for our sake that we by these examples might
learn soberness. Wherefore also he adds,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiv-p36">“To the intent we should not lust after evil
things, as they also lusted.” For as in the benefits the types
went before and the substance followed, such shall be the order
also in the punishments. Seest thou how he signifies not only the
fact that these shall be punished, but also the degree, more
severely than those ancients? For if the one be type, and the
other substance, it must needs be that the punishments should as
far exceed as the gifts.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiv-p37">And see whom he handles first: those who eat in
the idol-temples. For having said, “that we should not lust
after evil things,” which was general, he subjoins that which is
particular, implying that each of their sins arose from evil
lusting. And first he said this,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiv-p38"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 10.7" id="iv.xxiv-p38.1" parsed="|1Cor|10|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.10.7">Ver. 7</scripRef>.
“Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written,
‘the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to
play.’”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiv-p39">Do you hear how he even calls them “idolaters?”
here indeed making the declaration, but afterwards bringing the
proof. And he assigned the cause too wherefore they ran to those
tables; and this was gluttony. Wherefore having said, “to the
intent that we should not lust after evil things,” and having
added, nor “be idolaters,” he names the cause of such
transgression; and this was gluttony. “For the people sat
down,” saith he, “to eat and to drink,” and he adds the end
thereof, “they rose up to play.” “For even as they,”
saith he, “from sensuality passed into idolatry; so there is a
fear lest ye also may fall from the one into the other.” Do you
see how he signifies that these, perfect men forsooth, were more
imperfect than the others whom they censured? Not in this respect
only, their not bearing with their brethren throughout, but also in
that the one sin from ignorance, but the others from gluttony.
And from the ruin of the former he reckons the punishment to these,
but allows not these to lay upon another the cause of their own sin
but pronounces them responsible both for their injury, and for
their own.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiv-p40">“Neither let us commit fornication, as some of
them committed.” Wherefore doth he here make mention of
fornication again, having so largely discoursed concerning it
before? It is ever Paul’s custom when he brings a charge of
many sins, both to set them forth in order and separately to
proceed with his proposed topics, and again in his discourses
concerning other things to make mention also of the former: which
thing God also used to do in the Old Testament, in reference to
each several transgression, reminding the Jews of the calf and
bringing that sin before them. This then Paul also does here, at
the same time both reminding them of that sin, and teaching that
the parent of this evil also was luxury and gluttony. Wherefore
also he adds, “Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them
committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiv-p41">And wherefore names he not likewise the punishment
for their idolatry? Either because it was clear and more
notorious, or because the plague was not so great at that time, as
in the matter of Balaam, when they joined themselves to Baalpeor,
the Midianitish women appearing in the camp and alluring them to
wantonness according to the counsel of Balaam. For that this evil
counsel was Balaam’s Moses sheweth after this, in the following
statement at the end of the Book of Numbers. (<scripRef passage="Numb. xxxi. 8, 11, 15, 16" id="iv.xxiv-p41.1" parsed="|Num|31|8|0|0;|Num|31|11|0|0;|Num|31|15|0|0;|Num|31|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Num.31.8 Bible:Num.31.11 Bible:Num.31.15 Bible:Num.31.16">Numb. xxxi. 8, 11, 15, 16</scripRef>. in our translation.)
“Balaam also the son of Beor they slew in the war of Midian with
the sword and they brought the spoils.... And Moses was wroth, and
said, Wherefore have ye saved all the women alive? For these were
to the children of Israel for a stumbling-block, according to the
word of Balaam, to cause them to depart from and despise the word
of the Lord for Peor’s sake.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiv-p42"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 10.9" id="iv.xxiv-p42.1" parsed="|1Cor|10|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.10.9">Ver. 9</scripRef>.
“Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and
perished by serpents.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiv-p43">By this he again hints at another charge which he
likewise states at the end, blaming them because they contended
about signs. And indeed <pb n="135" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_135.html" id="iv.xxiv-Page_135" />they
were destroyed on account of trials, saying, “when will the good
things come? when the rewards?” Wherefore also he adds, on this
account correcting and alarming them,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiv-p44"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 10.10" id="iv.xxiv-p44.1" parsed="|1Cor|10|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.10.10">Ver. 10</scripRef>. “Neither murmur ye, as
some of them murmured, and perished by the destroyer.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiv-p45">For what is required is not only to suffer for
Christ, but also nobly to bear the things that come on us, and with
all gladness: since this is the nature of every crown. Yea, and
unless this be so, punishment rather will attend men who take
calamity with a bad grace. Wherefore, both the Apostles when they
were beaten rejoiced, and Paul gloried in his sufferings.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiv-p46">[5.] <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 10.11" id="iv.xxiv-p46.1" parsed="|1Cor|10|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.10.11">Ver. 11</scripRef>. “Now all these things
happened unto them by way of example; and they were written for our
admonition, upon whom the ends of the ages are come.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiv-p47">Again he terrifies them speaking of the “ends,”
and prepares them to expect things greater than had already taken
place. “For that we shall suffer punishment is manifest,”
saith he, “from what hath been said, even to those who disbelieve
the statements concerning hell-fire; but that the punishment also
will be most severe, is evident, from the more numerous blessings
which we have enjoyed, and from the things of which those were but
figures. Since, if in the gifts one go beyond the other, it is
most evident that so it will be in the punishment likewise.”
For this cause he both called them types, and said that they were
“written for us” and made mention of an “end” that he might
remind them of the consummation of all things. For not such will
be the penalties then as to admit of a termination and be done
away, but the punishment will be eternal; for even as the
punishments in this world are ended with the present life, so those
in the next continually remain. But when he said, “the ends of
the ages,” he means nothing else than that the fearful judgment
is henceforth nigh at hand.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiv-p48"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 10.12" id="iv.xxiv-p48.1" parsed="|1Cor|10|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.10.12">Ver. 12</scripRef>. “Wherefore let him that
thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiv-p49">Again, he casts down their pride who thought
highly of their knowledge. For if they who had so great
privileges suffered such things; and some for murmuring alone were
visited with such punishment, and others for tempting, and neither
their multitude moved God to repent<note place="end" n="113" id="iv.xxiv-p49.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxiv-p50"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxiv-p50.1">ἐ</span><span class="Greek" id="iv.xxiv-p50.2">δυσώπησε</span>.</p></note>, nor their having attained to such
things; much more shall it be so in our case, except we be sober.
And well said he, “he that thinketh he standeth:” for this is
not even standing as one ought to stand, to rely on yourself: for
quickly will such an one fall: since they too, had they not been
high-minded and self-confident, but of a subdued frame of mind,
would not have suffered these things. Whence it is evident, that
chiefly pride, and carelessness from which comes gluttony also, are
the sources of these evils. Wherefore even though thou stand, yet
take heed lest thou fall. For our standing here is not secure
standing, no not until we be delivered out of the waves of this
present life and have sailed into the tranquil haven. Be not
therefore high-minded at thy standing, but guard against thy
falling; for if Paul feared who was firmer than all, much more
ought we to fear.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiv-p51">[6.] Now the Apostle’s word, as we have seen,
was, “Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest
he fall;” but we cannot say even this; all of us, so to speak,
having fallen, and lying prostrate on the ground. For to whom am
I to say this? To him that committeth extortion every day? Nay,
he lies prostrate with a mighty fall. To the fornicator? He too
is cast down to the ground. To the drunkard? He also is fallen,
and knoweth not even that he is fallen. So that it is not the
season for this word, but for that saying of the prophet which he
spake even to the Jews, (<scripRef passage="Jer. viii. 4" id="iv.xxiv-p51.1" parsed="|Jer|8|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Jer.8.4">Jer. viii. 4</scripRef>.)—“He that falleth, doth
he not rise again?” For all are fallen, and to rise again they
have no mind. So that our exhortation is not concerning the not
falling, but concerning the ability of them that are fallen to
arise. Let us rise again then, late though it be, beloved, let us
rise again, and let us stand nobly. How long do we lie
prostrate? How long are we drunken, besotted with the excessive
desire of the things of this life? It is a meet opportunity now
to say, (<scripRef passage="Jer. vi. 10" id="iv.xxiv-p51.2" parsed="|Jer|6|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Jer.6.10">Jer. vi. 10</scripRef>.) “To whom shall I speak and
testify?” So deaf are all men become even to the very
instruction of virtue, and thence filled with abundance of evils.
And were it possible to discern their souls naked; as in armies
when the battle is ended one may behold some dead, and some
wounded, so also in the Church we might see. Wherefore I beseech
and implore you, let us stretch out a hand to each other and
thoroughly raise ourselves up. For I myself am of them that are
smitten, and require one to apply some remedies.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiv-p52">Do not however despair on this account. For what
if the wounds be severe? yet are they not incurable; such is our
physician: only let us feel our wounds. Although we be arrived
at the very extreme of wickedness, many are the ways of safety
which He strikes out for us. Thus, if thou forbear to be angry
with thy neighbor, thine own sins shall be forgiven. “For if ye
forgive men,” saith He, “your heavenly Father will also forgive
you.” (<scripRef passage="Matt. vi. 14" id="iv.xxiv-p52.1" parsed="|Matt|6|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.6.14">Matt. vi. 14</scripRef>.) And if thou give alms, He
will remit thee thy sins; for, “break off thy sins,” saith He,
“by alms.” (<scripRef passage="Dan. iv. 24" id="iv.xxiv-p52.2" parsed="|Dan|4|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Dan.4.24">Dan. iv.
24</scripRef>.) And if thou <pb n="136" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_136.html" id="iv.xxiv-Page_136" />pray earnestly, thou shalt enjoy
forgiveness: and this the widow signifieth who prevailed upon
that cruel judge by the importunity of her prayer. And if thou
accuse thine own sins, thou hast relief: for “declare thou
thine iniquities first, that thou mayest be justified:” (<scripRef passage="Is. xlvii. 26" id="iv.xxiv-p52.3" parsed="|Isa|47|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.47.26">Is. xlvii. 26</scripRef>.) and if thou art sorrowful on
account of these things, this too will be to thee a powerful
remedy: “for I saw,” saith He, “that he was grieved and
went sorrowful, and I healed his ways.” (<scripRef passage="Is. lvii. 17" id="iv.xxiv-p52.4" parsed="|Isa|57|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.57.17">Is. lvii. 17</scripRef>.) And if, when thou
sufferest any evil, thou bear it nobly, thou hast put away the
whole. For this also did Abraham say to the rich man, that
“Lazarus received his evil things, and here he is comforted.”
And if thou hast pity on the widow, thy sins are washed away.
For, “Judge,” saith He, “the orphan, and plead for the widow,
and come and let us reason together, saith the Lord. And if your
sins be as scarlet, I will make them white as snow; and if they be
as crimson, I will make them white as wool.” (<scripRef passage="Is. i. 17" id="iv.xxiv-p52.5" parsed="|Isa|1|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.1.17">Is. i. 17</scripRef>.) For not even a single scar
of the wounds doth He suffer to appear. Yea, and though we be
come to that depth of misery into which he fell, who devoured his
father’s substance and fed upon husks, and should repent, we are
undoubtedly saved. And though we owe ten thousand talents, if we
fall down before God and bear no malice, all things are forgiven
us. Although we have wandered away to that place whither the
sheep strayed from his keeper, even thence He recovers us again: 
only let us be willing, beloved. For God is merciful. Wherefore
both in the case of him that owed ten thousand talents, He was
content with His falling down before Him; and in the case of him
who had devoured his father’s goods, with his return only; and in
the case of the sheep, with its willingness to be borne.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiv-p53">[7.] Considering therefore the greatness of His
mercy, let us here make Him propitious unto us, and “let us come
before His face by a full confession,” (<scripRef passage="Ps. xcv. 2" id="iv.xxiv-p53.1" parsed="|Ps|95|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.95.2">Ps. xcv. 2</scripRef>. LXX.) that we may not depart
hence without excuse, and have to endure the extreme punishment.
For if in the present life we exhibit even an ordinary diligence,
we shall gain the greatest rewards: but if we depart having
become nothing better here, even though we repent ever so earnestly
there it will do us no good. For it was our duty to strive while
yet remaining within the lists, not after the assembly was broken
up idly to lament and weep: as that rich man did, bewailing and
deploring himself, but to no purpose and in vain, since he
overlooked the time in which he ought to have done these things.
And not he alone, but many others there are like him now among the
rich; not willing to despise wealth, but despising their own souls
for wealth’s sake: at whom I cannot but wonder, when I see men
continually interceding with God for mercy, whilst they are doing
themselves incurable harm, and unsparing of their very soul as if
it were an enemy. Let us not then trifle, beloved, let us not
trifle nor delude ourselves, beseeching God to have mercy upon us,
whilst we ourselves prefer both money and luxury, and, in fact, all
things to this mercy. For neither, if any one brought before thee
a case and said in accusation of such an one, that being to suffer
ten thousand deaths and having it in his power to rid himself of
the sentence by a little money, he chose rather to die than to give
up any of his property, would you say that he was worthy of any
mercy or compassion. Now in this same way do thou also reason
touching thyself. For we too act in this way, and making light of
our own salvation, we are sparing of our money. How then dost
thou beseech God to spare thee, when thou thyself art so unsparing
of thyself, and honorest money above thy soul?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiv-p54">Wherefore also I am greatly astonished to see,
how great witchery lies hid in wealth, or rather not in wealth, but
in the souls of those that are beguiled. For there are, there are
those that utterly derided this sorcery<note place="end" n="114" id="iv.xxiv-p54.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxiv-p55"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxiv-p55.1">μαγγανείας</span>.</p></note>. For which among the things

unworthy of trust? is it not full of fears and? dangers? nay, of
murders and conspiracy? of enmity and hatred? of carelessness and
much vice? is it not dust and ashes? what madness have we here?
what disease?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiv-p56">“But,” say you, “we ought not merely to bring
such accusations against those that are so diseased, but also to
destroy the passion.” And in what other way shall we destroy
it, except by pointing out its baseness and how full it is of
innumerable evils?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiv-p57">But of this it is not easy to persuade a lover
concerning the objects of his love. Well then, we must set before
him another sort of beauty. But incorporeal beauty he sees not,
being yet in his disease. Well then, let us show him some beauty
of a corporeal kind, and say to him, Consider the meadows and the
flowers therein, which are more sparkling than any gold, and more
elegant and transparent than all kinds of precious stones.
Consider the limpid streams from their fountains, the rivers which
like oil flow noiselessly out of the earth. Ascend to heaven and
behold the lustre of the sun, the beauty of the moon, the stars
that cluster like flowers<note place="end" n="115" id="iv.xxiv-p57.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxiv-p58"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxiv-p58.1">τῶν ἀστρῶν ὰ

you, “since we do not, I suppose, make use of them as of
wealth?” Nay, we use them more than 
<pb n="137" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_137.html" id="iv.xxiv-Page_137" />wealth, inasmuch as the use thereof is more
needful, the enjoyment more secure. For thou hast no fear, lest,
like money, any one should take them and go off: but you may be
ever confident of having them, and that without anxiety or care.
But if thou grieve because thou enjoyest them in common with
others, and dost not possess them alone like money; it is not
money, but mere covetousness, which thou seemest to me to be in
love with: nor would even the money be an object of thy desire,
if it had been placed within reach of all in common.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiv-p59">[8.] Therefore, since we have found the beloved
object, I mean Covetousness, come let me show thee how she hates
and abhors thee, how many swords she sharpens against thee, how
many pits she digs, how many nooses she ties, how many precipices
she prepares; that thus at any rate thou mayest do away with the
charm. Whence then are we to obtain this knowledge? From the
highways, from the wars, from the sea, from the courts of
justice. For she hath both filled the sea with blood, and the
swords of the judges she often reddens contrary to law, and arms
those who on the highway lie in wait day and night, and persuades
men to forget nature, and makes parricides and matricides, and
introduces all sorts of evils into man’s life.  Which is the
reason why Paul entitles her “a root of these things.” (<scripRef passage="1 Tim. vi. 10" id="iv.xxiv-p59.1" parsed="|1Tim|6|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.6.10">1 Tim. vi. 10</scripRef>.) She suffers not her lovers
to be in any better condition than those who work in the mines.
For as they, perpetually shut up in darkness and in chains, labor
unprofitably; so also these buried in the caves of avarice, no one
using any force with them, voluntarily draw on their punishment,
binding on themselves fetters that cannot be broken. And those
condemned to the mines at least when even comes on, are released
from their toils; but these both by day and night are digging in
these wretched mines. And to those there is a definite limit of
that hard labor, but these know no limit, but the more they dig so
much the greater hardship do they desire. And what if those do it
unwillingly, but these of their own will? in that thou tellest me
of the grievous part of the disease, that it is even impossible for
them to be rid of it, since they do not so much as hate their
wretchedness. But as a swine in mud, so also do these delight to
wallow in the noisome mire of avarice, suffering worse things than
those condemned ones. As to the fact that they are in a worse
condition, hear the circumstances of the one, and then thou wilt
know the state of the other.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiv-p60">Now it is said that that soil which is impregnated
with gold has certain clefts and recesses in those gloomy
caverns. The malefactor then condemned to labor in that place,
taking for that purpose a lamp and a mattock, so, we are told,
enters within, and carries with him a cruse to drop oil from thence
into the lamp, because there is darkness even by day, without a ray
of light, as I said before. Then when the time of day calls him
to his wretched meal, himself, they say, is ignorant of the time,
but his jailor from above striking violently on the cave, by that
clattering sound declares to those who are at work below the end of
the day.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiv-p61">Do ye not shudder when ye hear all this? Let us
see now, whether there be not things more grievous than these in
the case of the covetous. For these too, in the first place, have
a severer jailor, viz. avarice, and so much severer, as that
besides their body he chains also their soul. And this darkness
also is more awful than that. For it is not subject to sense, but
they producing it within, whithersoever they go, carry it about
with themselves. For the eye of their soul is put out: which is
the reason why more than all Christ calls them wretched, saying,
“But if the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that
darkness.” (S. <scripRef passage="Matt.vi. 23" id="iv.xxiv-p61.1" parsed="|Matt|6|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.6.23">Matt.vi.

part have at least a lamp shining, but these are deprived even of
this beam of light; and therefore every day they fall into
countless pitfalls. And the condemned when night overtakes them
have a respite, sailing into that calm port which is common to all
the unfortunate, I mean the night: but against the covetous even
this harbor is blocked up by their own avarice: such grievous
thoughts have they even at night, since then, without disturbance
from any one, at full leisure they cut themselves to pieces.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiv-p62">Such are their circumstances in this world; but
those in the next, what discourse shall exhibit? the intolerable
furnaces, the rivers burning with fire, the gnashing of teeth, the

the fountain of so great punishments, the insatiate madness, the
destroyer of our salvation. For it is impossible at the same time
to love both money and your soul. Let us be convinced that wealth
is dust and ashes, that it leaves us when we depart hence, or
rather that even before our departure it oftentimes darts away from
us, and injures us both in regard of the future and in respect of
the present life. For before hell fire, and before that
punishment, even here it surrounds us with innumerable wars, and
stirs up strifes and contests. For nothing is so apt to cause war
as avarice: nothing so apt to produce beggary, whether it show
itself in wealth or in poverty. For in the souls of poor men also
this grievous disease ariseth, and aggravates their poverty the
more. And if there be found a poor covetous man, such an one
suffers not punishment in 
<pb n="138" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_138.html" id="iv.xxiv-Page_138" />money, but in hunger. For he allows not himself
to enjoy his moderate means with comfort, but both racks his belly
with hunger and punishes his whole body with nakedness and cold,
and every where appears more squalid and filthy than any prisoners;
and is always wailing and lamenting as though he were more wretched
than all, though there be ten thousand poorer than he. This man,
whether he go into the market-place, goes away with many a stripe;
or into the bath, or into the theatre, he will still be receiving
more wounds, not only from the spectators, but also from those upon
the stage, where he beholds not a few of the unchaste women
glittering in gold. This man again, whether he sail upon the sea,
regarding the merchants and their richly-freighted ships and their
enormous profits, will not even count himself to live: or whether
he travel by land, reckoning up the fields, the suburban farms, the
inns, the baths, the revenues arising out of them, will count his
own life thenceforth not worth living; or whether thou shut him up
at home, he will but rub and fret the wounds received in the
market, and so do greater despite to his own soul: and he knows
only one consolation for the evils which oppress him; death and
deliverance from this life.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiv-p63">And these things not the poor man only, but the rich
also, will suffer, who falls into this disease, and so much more
than the poor, inasmuch as the tyranny presses more vehemently on
him, and the intoxication is greater. Wherefore also he will
account himself poorer than all; or rather, he is poorer. For
riches and poverty are determined not by the measure of the
substance, but by the disposition of the mind: and he rather is
the poorest of all, who is always hangering after more and is never
able to stay this wicked lust.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxiv-p64">On all these accounts then let us flee covetousness,
the maker of beggars, the destroyer of souls, the friend of hell,
the enemy of the kingdom of heaven, the mother of all evils
together; and let us despise wealth that we may enjoy wealth, and
with wealth may enjoy also the good things laid up for us; unto
which may we all attain, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="c27" id="iv.xxv-p3">There hath no temptation taken you, but such as man

also the way of escape, that ye may be able to endure it.</p>

<p class="c24" id="iv.xxv-p4"><span class="c18" id="iv.xxv-p4.1">Thus</span>, because he terrified
them greatly, relating the ancient examples, and threw them into an
agony, saying, “Let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest
he fall; “though they had borne many temptations, and had
exercised themselves many times therein; for “I was with you,”
saith he, “in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling:”

say, “Why terrify and alarm us? we are not unexercised in these
troubles, for we have been both driven and persecuted, and many and
continual dangers have we endured:” repressing again their
pride, he says, “there hath no temptation taken you but such as
man can bear,” i.e., small, brief, moderate. For he uses the
expression “man can bear<note place="end" n="116" id="iv.xxv-p4.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxv-p5"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxv-p5.1">ἀ</span><span class="Greek" id="iv.xxv-p5.2">νθρώπινον</span>.</p></note>,” in respect of what is small; as
when he says, “I speak after the manner of men because of the
infirmity of your flesh.” (<scripRef passage="Rom. vi. 19" id="iv.xxv-p5.3" parsed="|Rom|6|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.6.19">Rom. vi. 19</scripRef>.) “Think not then great
things,” saith he, “as though ye had overcome the storm. For
never have ye seen a danger threatening death nor a temptation
intending slaughter:” which also he said to the Hebrews, “ye
have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin.” (<scripRef passage="Heb. xii. 4" id="iv.xxv-p5.4" parsed="|Heb|12|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Heb.12.4">Heb. xii. 4</scripRef>.)</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxv-p6">Then, because he terrified them, see how again he
raises them up, at the same time recommending moderation; in the
words, “God is faithful, Who will not suffer you to be tempted
above that ye are able.” There are therefore temptations which
we are not able to bear. And what are these? All, so to
speak. For the ability lies in God’s gracious influence; a
power which we draw down by our own will. Wherefore that thou
mayest know and see that not only those which exceed our power, but
not even these which are “common to man” is it possible without
assistance from God easily to bear, he added,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxv-p7">“But will with the temptation also make the way of
escape, that ye may be able to endure it.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxv-p8">For, saith he, not even those moderate temptations,
as I was remarking, may we bear by our 
<pb n="139" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_139.html" id="iv.xxv-Page_139" />own power: but even in them we require aid from
Him in our warfare that we may pass through them, and until we have
passed, bear them. For He gives patience and brings on a speedy
release; so that in this way also the temptation becomes
bearable. This he covertly intimates, saying, “will also make
the way of escape, that ye may be able to bear it:” and all
things he refers to Him.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxv-p9">[2.] <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 10.14" id="iv.xxv-p9.1" parsed="|1Cor|10|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.10.14">Ver. 14</scripRef>. “Wherefore, my

idolatry.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxv-p11">Again he courts them by the name of kindred, and
urges them to be rid of this sin with all speed. For he did not
say, simply, depart, but “flee;” and he calls the matter
“idolatry,” and no longer bids them quit it merely on account
of the injury to their neighbor, but signifies that the very thing
of itself is sufficient to bring a great destruction.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxv-p12"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 10.15" id="iv.xxv-p12.1" parsed="|1Cor|10|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.10.15">Ver. 15</scripRef>. “I speak as to wise
men: judge ye what I say.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxv-p13">Because he hath cried out aloud and heightened the
accusation, calling it idolatry; that he might not seem to
exasperate them and to make his speech disgusting, in what follows
he refers the decision to them, and sets his judges down on their
tribunal with an encomium. “For I speak as to wise men,”
saith he: which is the mark of one very confident of his own
rights, that he should make the accused himself the judge of his
allegations.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxv-p14">Thus also he more elevates the hearer, when he
discourses not as commanding nor as laying down the law, but as
advising with them and as actually pleading before them. For with
the Jews, as more foolishly and childishly disposed, God did not so
discourse, nor did He in every instance acquaint them with the
reasons of the commands, but merely enjoined them; but here,
because we have the privilege of great liberty, we are even
admitted to be counsellors. And he discourses as with friends,
and says, “I need no other judges, do ye yourselves pass this
sentence upon me, I take you for arbiters.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxv-p16">What sayest thou, O blessed Paul? When thou
wouldest appeal to the hearer’s reverence, when thou art making
mention of awful mysteries, dost thou give the title of “cup of
blessing” to that fearful and most tremendous cup? “Yea,”
saith he; “and no mean title is that which was spoken. For when
I call it ‘blessing,’ I mean thanksgiving, and when I call it
thanksgiving I unfold all the treasure of God’s goodness, and
call to mind those mighty gifts.” Since we too, recounting over
the cup the unspeakable mercies of God and all that we have been
made partakers of, so draw near to Him, and communicate; giving Him
thanks that He hath delivered from error the whole race of
mankind<note place="end" n="118" id="iv.xxv-p16.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxv-p17"> “When we had fallen away, Thou didst raise us

Kingdom.” Liturgy of St. Chrysostom. Ed. Savile. vi. 996.
“When we had fallen from our eternal life and were exiles from
the Paradise of delight: Thou didst not cast us off to the end,
but did, visit us continually,” &amp;c. Lit. of St. Basil, t.
ii. 677: and so in all the old Liturgies, vid. Brett’s
Collection.</p></note>; that being
afar off, He made them nigh; that when they had no hope and were
without God in the world, He constituted them His own brethren and
fellow-heirs. For these and all such things, giving thanks, thus
we approach. “How then are not your doings inconsistent,”
saith he, “O ye Corinthians; blessing God for delivering you from
idols, yet running again to their tables?”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxv-p18">“The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a
communion of the Blood of Christ?” Very persuasively spake he,
and awfully. For what he says is this: “This which is in the
cup is that which flowed from His side, and of that do we
partake.” But he called it a cup of blessing, because holding
it in our hands, we so exalt Him in our hymn, wondering, astonished
at His unspeakable gift, blessing Him, among other things, for the
pouring out of this self-same draught that we might not abide in
error: and not only for the pouring it out, but also for the
imparting thereof to us all. “Wherefore if thou desire
blood,” saith He, “redden not the altar of idols with the
slaughter of brute beasts, but My altar with My blood.” Tell
me, What can be more tremendous than this? What more tenderly
kind? This also lovers do. When they see those whom they love
desiring what belongs to strangers and despising their own, they
give what belongs to themselves, and so persuade them to withdraw
themselves from the gifts of those others. Lovers, however,
display this liberality in goods and money and garments, but in
blood none ever did so. Whereas Christ even herein exhibited His
care and fervent love for us. And in the old covenant, because
they were in an imperfect state, the blood which they used to offer
to idols He Himself submitted to receive, that He might separate
them from those idols; which very thing again was a proof of His
unspeakable affection: but here He transferred the service to
that which is far more awful and glorious, changing the very
sacrifice itself, and instead of the slaughter of irrational
creatures, commanding to offer up Himself.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxv-p19">[4.] “The bread which we break, is it not a
communion of the Body of Christ?” Wherefore said he not, the
participation? Because he intended to express something more and
to <pb n="140" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_140.html" id="iv.xxv-Page_140" />point out how close was the
union: in that we communicate not only by participating and
partaking, but also by being united. For as that body is united
to Christ, so also are we united to him by this bread.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxv-p20">But why adds he also, “which we break?” For
although in the Eucharist one may see this done, yet on the cross
not so, but the very contrary. For, “A bone of Him,” saith
one, “shall not be broken.” But that which He suffered not on
the cross, this He suffers in the oblation for thy sake, and
submits to be broken, that he may fill all men.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxv-p21">Further, because he said, “a communion of the
Body,” and that which communicates is another thing from that
whereof it communicates; even this which seemeth to be but a small
difference, he took away. For having said, “a communion of the
Body,” he sought again to express something nearer. Wherefore
also he added,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxv-p22"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 10.17" id="iv.xxv-p22.1" parsed="|1Cor|10|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.10.17">Ver. 17</scripRef>. “For we, who are many,
are one bread, one body.” “For why speak I of communion?”
saith he, “we are that self-same body.” For what is the
bread? The Body of Christ. And what do they become who partake
of it? The Body of Christ: not many bodies, but one body. For
as the bread consisting of many grains is made one, so that the
grains no where appear; they exist indeed, but their difference is
not seen by reason of their conjunction; so are we conjoined both
with each other and with Christ: there not being one body for
thee, and another for thy neighbor to be nourished by, but the very
same for all. Wherefore also he adds,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxv-p23">“For we all partake of the one bread.” Now if
we are all nourished of the same and all become the same, why do we
not also show forth the same love, and become also in this respect
one? For this was the old way too in the time of our
forefathers: “for the multitude of them that believed,” saith
the text, “were of one heart and soul.” (<scripRef passage="Acts iv. 32" id="iv.xxv-p23.1" parsed="|Acts|4|32|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.4.32">Acts iv. 32</scripRef>.) Not so, however, now, but
altogether the reverse. Many and various are the contests betwixt
all, and worse than wild beasts are we affected towards each
other’s members. And Christ indeed made thee so far remote, one
with himself: but thou dost not deign to be united even to thy
brother with due exactness, but separatest thyself, having had the
privilege of so great love and life from the Lord. For he gave
not simply even His own body; but because the former nature of the
flesh which was framed out of earth, had first become deadened by
sin and destitute of life; He brought in, as one may say, another
sort of dough and leaven, His own flesh, by nature indeed the same,
but free from sin and full of life; and gave to all to partake
thereof, that being nourished by this and laying aside the old dead
material, we might be blended together unto that which is living
and eternal, by means of this table.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxv-p24">[5.] <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 10.18" id="iv.xxv-p24.1" parsed="|1Cor|10|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.10.18">Ver. 18</scripRef>. “Behold Israel after the
flesh: have not they which eat the sacrifices communion with the
altar?”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxv-p25">Again, from the old covenant he leads them
unto this point also. For because they were far beneath the
greatness of the things which had been spoken, he persuades them
both from former things and from those to which they were
accustomed. And he says well, “according to the flesh,” as
though they themselves were according to the Spirit. And what he
says is of this nature: “even from persons of the grosser sort
ye may be instructed that they who eat the sacrifices, have
communion with the altar.” Dost thou see how he intimates that
they who seemed to be perfect have not perfect knowledge, if they
know not even this, that the result of these sacrifices to many
oftentimes is a certain communion and friendship with devils, the
practice drawing them on by degrees? For if among men the
fellowship of salt<note place="end" n="119" id="iv.xxv-p25.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxv-p26"> Cf. <scripRef passage="Lev. ii. 13; Numbers xviii. 19; 2 Chron. xiii. 5" id="iv.xxv-p26.1" parsed="|Lev|2|13|0|0;|Num|18|19|0|0;|2Chr|13|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Lev.2.13 Bible:Num.18.19 Bible:2Chr.13.5">Lev.

latter place says, “By <i>a covenant of salt for ever</i>, he
expresses the stability of the Kingdom, since even Barbarians
oftentimes upon eating with their enemies keep the peace entire,
<i>remembering the salt</i> thereof.”</p></note> and the table becomes an occasion
and token of friendship, it is possible that this may happen also
in the case of devils.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxv-p27">But do thou, I pray, consider, how with regard to
the Jews he said not, “they are par-takers with God,” but,
“they have communion with the altar;” for what was placed
thereon was burnt: but in respect to the Body of Christ, not
so. But how? It is “a Communion of the Lord’s Body.”
For not with the altar, but with Christ Himself, do we have
communion.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxv-p28">But having said that they have “communion with the
altar,” afterwards fearing lest he should seem to discourse as if
the idols had any power and could do some injury, see again how he
overthrows them, saying,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxv-p29"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 10.19" id="iv.xxv-p29.1" parsed="|1Cor|10|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.10.19">Ver. 19</scripRef>. “What say I then? That
an idol is any thing? or that a thing sacrificed to idols is any
thing?”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxv-p30">As if he had said, “Now these things I affirm, and
try to withdraw you from the idols, not as though they could do any
injury or had any power: for an idol is nothing; but I wish you
to despise them.” “And if thou wilt have us despise them,”
saith one, “wherefore dost thou carefully withdraw us from

to the contrary things. For neither if thou wert a king’s son,
and having the privilege of thy father’s table, shouldest leave
it and choose to partake of the table of the condemned and the
prisoners in the dungeon, would thy father permit it, but with
great vehemence he would withdraw thee; not as though the table
could harm thee, but because it disgraces thy nobility and the
royal table. For verily these too are servants who have offended;
dishonored, condemned, prisoners reserved for intolerable
punishment, accountable for ten thousand crimes. How then art
thou not ashamed to imitate the gluttonous and vulgar crew, in that
when these condemned persons set out a table, thou runnest thither
and partakest of the viands? Here is the cause why I seek to
withdraw thee. For the intention of the sacrificers, and the
person of the receivers, maketh the things set before thee
unclean.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxv-p34">“And I would not that ye should have communion

father? Perceivest thou also the very word, what force it hath to
express his feeling? “For it is my wish,” saith he, “that
you have nothing in common with them.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxv-p35">[6.] Next, because he brought in the saying by way
of exhortation, lest any of the grosser sort should make light of
it as having license, because he said, “I would not,” and,
“judge ye;” he positively affirms in what follows and lays down
the law, saying,</p>

able to punish us, and irritating Him by going over to the
adversaries and taking our stand with His enemies?” And this he
said, reminding them of an ancient history and of their fathers’
transgression. Wherefore also he makes use of this expression,
which Moses likewise of old used against the Jews, accusing them of
idolatry in the person of God. “For they,” saith He, “moved
Me to jealousy<note place="end" n="122" id="iv.xxv-p39.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxv-p40"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxv-p40.1">παρεζήλωσαν</span>.</p></note> with that

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxv-p41">“Are we stronger than He?” Dost thou see how
terribly, how awfully he rebukes them, thoroughly shaking their
very nerves, and by his way of reducing them to an absurdity,
touching them to the quick and bringing down their pride? 
“Well, but why,” some one will say, “did he not set down
these things at first, which would be most effectual to withdraw
them?” Because it is his custom to prove his point by many
particulars, and to place the strongest last, and to prevail by
proving more than was necessary. On this account then, he began
from the lesser topics, and so made his way to that which is the
sum of all evils: since thus that last point also became more
easily admitted, their mind having been smoothed down by the things
said before.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxv-p42"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 10.23,24" id="iv.xxv-p42.1" parsed="|1Cor|10|23|10|24" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.10.23-1Cor.10.24">Ver. 23, 24</scripRef>. “All things are lawful

each his neighbor’s good.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxv-p43">Seest thou his exact wisdom? Because it was likely
that they might say, “I am perfect and master of myself, and it
does me no harm to partake of what is set before me;” “Even
so,” saith he, “perfect thou art and master of thyself; do not
however look to this, but whether the result involve not injury,
nay subversion.” For both these he mentioned, saying, “All
things are not expedient, all things edify not;” and using the
former with reference to one’s self, the latter, to one’s
brother: since the clause, “are not expedient,” is a covert
intimation of the ruin of the person to whom he speaks; but the
clause, “edify not,” of the stumbling block to the brother.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxv-p44">Wherefore also he adds, “Let no man seek his

and in that to the Romans; when he says, “For even Christ pleased
not Himself:” (<scripRef passage="Rom. xv. 3" id="iv.xxv-p44.1" parsed="|Rom|15|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.15.3">Rom.

“Even as I please all men in all things, not seeking mine own
profit.” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. x. 33" id="iv.xxv-p44.2" parsed="|1Cor|10|33|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.10.33">1 Cor. x.
33</scripRef>.) And again in this
place; he does not, however, fully work it out here. That is,
since in what had gone before he had established it at length, and
shown that he no where “seeks his own,” but both “to the Jews
became as a Jew and to them that are without law as without law,”
and used not his own “liberty” and “right” at random, but
to the profit of all, serving all; he here broke off, content with
a few words, by these few guiding them to the remembrance of all
which had been said.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxv-p45">[7.] These things therefore knowing, let us also,
beloved, consult for the good of the brethren and preserve unity
with them. For to this that fearful and tremendous sacrifice
leads us, warning us above all things to approach it with one mind
and fervent love, and thereby becoming eagles, so to mount up to
the very heaven, nay, even beyond the heaven. “For wheresoever
the carcase is,” saith He, “there also will be the eagles,”
(St. <scripRef passage="Matt. xxiv. 28" id="iv.xxv-p45.1" parsed="|Matt|24|28|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.24.28">Matt. xxiv. 28</scripRef>.) calling His <pb n="142" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_142.html" id="iv.xxv-Page_142" />body a carcase by reason of His
death. For unless He had fallen, we should not have risen
again. But He calls us eagles, implying that he who draws nigh to
this Body must be on high and have nothing common with the earth,
nor wind himself downwards and creep along; but must ever be
soaring heavenwards, and look on the Sun of Righteousness, and have
the eye of his mind quick-sighted. For eagles, not daws, have a
right to this table.<note place="end" n="123" id="iv.xxv-p45.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxv-p46"> “This Table is not, saith Chrysostom, for

we have come to know what the <i>eagles</i> are, we can no longer
doubt about the <i>Body</i>; especially if we recollect that Body
which Joseph once received from Pilate. Seem they not unto thee
as eagles around a Body, I mean Mary the wife of Cleopas, and Mary
Magdelene and Mary the Mother of the Lord, and the gathering of the
Apostles around the Lord’s entombing? Doth it not seem to thee
as eagles around a body, when the Son of Man shall come with the
mystical clouds, <i>and every eye shall see Him, and they also
which pierced Him</i>?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxv-p47">“There is also the Body
concerning which it was said, <i>My Flesh is meat indeed, and My
Blood is drink indeed</i>. Around this Body are certain eagles,
which hover over It with spiritual wings. They are also eagles
round the Body, which believe the Jesus is come in the Flesh: 
since <i>every spirit which confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in
the flesh, is of God</i>. Wheresoever then faith is, there is the
Sacrament, there the resting place of holiness. Again, this Body
is the Church, wherein by the grace of Baptism we are renovated in
spirit, and whatever tends to decay through old age is refreshed,
for ages of new life.”</p>

receive this with so great insolence? Let us not, I pray you, let
us not slay ourselves by our irreverence, but with all awfulness
and purity draw nigh to It; and when thou seest It set before thee,
say thou to thyself, “Because of this Body am I no longer earth
and ashes, no longer a prisoner, but free: because of this I hope
for heaven, and to receive the good things therein, immortal life,
the portion of angels, converse with Christ; this Body, nailed and
scourged, was more than death could stand against; this Body the
very sun saw sacrificed, and turned aside his beams; for this both
the veil was rent in that moment, and rocks were burst asunder, and
all the earth was shaken. This is even that Body, the
blood-stained, the pierced, and that out of which gushed the saving
fountains, the one of blood, the other of water, for all the
world.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxv-p51">Wouldest thou from another source also learn its
power? Ask of her diseased with an issue of blood, who laid hold
not of Itself, but of the garment with which It was clad; nay not

It on its back: ask even of the Devil himself, and say, “Whence
hast thou that incurable stroke? whence hast thou no longer any
power? Whence art thou captive? By whom hast thou been seized
in thy flight?” And he will give no other answer than this,
“The Body that was crucified.” By this were his goads broken
in pieces; by this was his head crushed; by this were the powers
and the principalities made a show of. “For,” saith he,
“having put off from himself principalities and powers, He made a
show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.” (<scripRef passage="Col. ii. 15" id="iv.xxv-p51.1" parsed="|Col|2|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Col.2.15">Col. ii. 15</scripRef>.)</p>

one of the many, death on the contrary should have become more
mighty; but it was not so. For He was not one of the many.
Therefore was death dissolved. And as they who take food which
they are unable to retain, on account of that vomit up also what
was before lodged in them; so also it happened unto death. That
Body, which he could not digest, he received: and therefore had
to cast forth that which he had within him. Yea, he travailed in
pain, whilst he held Him, and was straitened until He vomited Him
up. Wherefore saith the Apostle, “Having loosed the pains of
death.” (<scripRef passage="Acts xi. 24" id="iv.xxv-p53.6" parsed="|Acts|11|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.11.24">Acts

never woman labouring of child was so full of anguish as he was
torn and racked in sunder, while he held the Body of the Lord.
And that which happened to the Babylonian dragon, when, having
taken the food it burst asunder in the midst,<note place="end" n="126" id="iv.xxv-p53.7"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxv-p54"> <scripRef passage="Bel and the Dragon, v. 27" id="iv.xxv-p54.1">Bel and

<pb n="143" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_143.html" id="iv.xxv-Page_143" />this also happened unto him. For Christ came
not forth again by the mouth of death, but having burst asunder and
ripped up in the very midst, the belly of the dragon, thus from His
secret chambers (<scripRef passage="Ps. xix. 5" id="iv.xxv-p54.2" parsed="|Ps|19|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.19.5">Ps. xix.
5</scripRef>.) right gloriously He
issued forth and flung abroad His beams not to this heaven alone,
but to the very throne most high. For even thither did He carry
it up.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxv-p55">This Body hath He given to us both to hold and to
eat; a thing appropriate to intense love. For those whom we kiss
vehemently, we oft-times even bite with our teeth. Wherefore also
Job, indicating the love of his servants towards him, said, that
they ofttimes, out of their great affection towards him, said,
“Oh! that we were filled with his flesh!” (<scripRef passage="Job xxxi. 31" id="iv.xxv-p55.1" parsed="|Job|31|31|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Job.31.31">Job xxxi. 31</scripRef>.) Even so Christ hath given
to us to be filled with His flesh, drawing us on to greater
love.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxv-p56">[8.] Let us draw nigh to Him then with fervency
and with inflamed love, that we may not have to endure
punishment. For in proportion to the greatness of the benefits
bestowed on us, so much the more exceedingly are we chastised when
we show ourselves unworthy of the bountifulness. This Body, even
lying in a manger, Magi reverenced. Yea, men profane and
barbarous, leaving their country and their home, both set out on a
long journey, and when they came, with fear and great trembling
worshipped Him. Let us, then, at least imitate those Barbarians,
we who are citizens of heaven. For they indeed when they saw Him
but in a manger, and in a hut, and no such thing was in sight as
thou beholdest now, drew nigh with great awe; but thou beholdest
Him not in the manger but on the altar, not a woman holding Him in
her arms, but the priest standing by, and the Spirit with exceeding
bounty hovering over the gifts set before us. Thou dost not see
merely this Body itself as they did, but thou knowest also Its
power, and the whole economy, and art ignorant of none of the holy
things which are brought to pass by It, having been exactly
initiated into all.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxv-p57">Let us therefore rouse ourselves up and be filled
with horror, and let us show forth a reverence far beyond that of
those Barbarians; that we may not by random and careless approaches
heap fire upon our own heads.  But these things I say, not to keep
us from approaching, but to keep us from approaching without
consideration. For as the approaching at random is dangerous, so
the not communicating in those mystical suppers is famine and
death. For this Table is the sinews of our soul, the bond of our
mind, the foundation of our confidence, our hope, our salvation,
our light, our life. When with this sacrifice we depart into the
outer world, with much confidence we shall tread the sacred
threshold, fenced round on every side as with a kind of golden
armor.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxv-p58">And why speak I of the world to come? Since here
this mystery makes earth become to thee a heaven. Open only for
once the gates of heaven and look in; nay, rather not of heaven,
but of the heaven of heavens; and then thou wilt behold what I have
been speaking of. For what is there most precious of all, this
will I show thee lying upon the earth. For as in royal palaces,
what is most glorious of all is not walls, nor golden roofs, but
the person of the king sitting on the throne; so likewise in heaven
the Body of the King. But this, thou art now permitted to see
upon earth. For it is not angels, nor archangels, nor heavens and
heavens of heavens, that I show thee, but the very Lord and Owner
of these. Perceivest thou how that which is more precious than
all things is seen by thee on earth; and not seen only, but also
touched; and not only touched, but likewise eaten; and after
receiving It thou goest home?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxv-p59">Make thy soul clean then, prepare thy mind for the
reception of these mysteries. For if thou wert entrusted to carry
a king’s child with the robes, the purple, and the diadem, thou
wouldest cast away all things which are upon the earth. But now
that it is no child of man how royal soever, but the only-begotten
Son of God Himself, Whom thou receivedst; dost thou not thrill with
awe, tell me, and cast away all the love of all worldly things, and
have no bravery but that wherewith to adorn thyself? or dost thou
still look towards earth, and love money, and pant after gold? 
What pardon then canst thou have? what excuse? Knowest thou not
that all this worldly luxury is loathsome to thy Lord? Was it not
for this that on His birth He was laid in a manger, and took to
Himself a mother of low estate? Did He not for this say to him
that was looking after gain, “But the Son of Man hath not where
to lay His head?” (St. 
<scripRef passage="Matt. viii. 20" id="iv.xxv-p59.1" parsed="|Matt|8|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.8.20">Matt. viii. 20</scripRef>.)</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxv-p60">And what did the disciples? Did they not observe
the same law, being taken to houses of the poor and lodged, one
with a tanner, another with a tent-maker, and with the seller of
purple? For they inquired not after the splendor of the house,
but for the virtues of men’s souls.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxv-p61">These therefore let us also emulate, hastening by
the beauty of pillars and of marbles, and seeking the mansions
which are above; and let us tread under foot all the pride here
below with all love of money, and acquire a lofty mind.  For if we
be sober-minded, not even this whole world is worthy of us, much
less porticoes and arcades. Wherefore, I beseech you, let us
adorn our souls, let us fit up this house which we are also to have
with us when we depart; that we may attain even to the eternal
blessings, through the grace and mercy, &amp;c.</p>

filled them with great fear; that he might not by this fear drive
again to another extreme, and they be forced, exercising a greater
scrupulosity than was necessary, to feel alarm, lest possibly even
without their knowledge there might come in some such thing either
from the market or from some other quarter; to release them from
this strait, he saith, “Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, eat,
asking no question.”  “For,” saith he, “if thou eat in
ignorance and not knowingly, thou art not subject to the
punishment: it being thenceforth a matter not of greediness, but
of ignorance.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvi-p6">Nor doth he free the man only from this anxiety, but
also from another, establishing them in thorough security and
liberty. For he doth not even suffer them to “question;”
i.e., to search and enquire, whether it be an idol-sacrifice or no
such thing; but simply to eat every thing which comes from the
market, not even acquainting one’s self with so much as this,
what it is that is set before us. So that even he that eateth, if
in ignorance, may be rid of anxiety. For such is the nature of
those things which are not in their essence evil, but through the
man’s intention make him unclean. Wherefore he saith, “asking
no question.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvi-p7"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 10.26" id="iv.xxvi-p7.1" parsed="|1Cor|10|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.10.26">Ver. 26</scripRef>. “For to the Lord
belongeth the earth and the fulness thereof.” Not to the
devils. Now if the earth and the fruits and the beasts be all
His, nothing is unclean: but it becomes unclean otherwise, from
our intention and our disobedience. Wherefore he not only gave
permission, but also,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvi-p8"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 10.27" id="iv.xxvi-p8.1" parsed="|1Cor|10|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.10.27">Ver. 27</scripRef>. “If one of them that
believe not biddeth you,” saith he, “to a feast, and you are
disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no
question for conscience sake.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvi-p9">See again his moderation. For he did not command
and make a law that they should withdraw themselves, yet neither
did he forbid it. And again, should they depart, he frees them
from all suspicion. Now what may be the account of this? That
so great curiousness might not seem to arise from any fear and
cowardice. For he who makes scrupulous enquiry doth so as being
in dread: but he who, on hearing the fact, abstains, abstains as
out of contempt and hatred and aversion. Wherefore Paul,
purposing to establish both points, saith, “Whatsoever is set
before you, eat.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvi-p10"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 10.28" id="iv.xxvi-p10.1" parsed="|1Cor|10|28|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.10.28">Ver. 28</scripRef>. “But if any man say unto

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvi-p11">Thus it is not at all for any power that they
have but as accursed, that he bids abstain from them. Neither
then, as though they could injure you, fly from them, (for they
have no strength;) nor yet, because they have no strength,
indifferently partake: for it is the table of beings hostile and
degraded. Wherefore he said, “eat not for his sake that showed
it, and for conscience sake. For the earth is the Lord’s and
the fulness thereof.”<note place="end" n="128" id="iv.xxvi-p11.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxvi-p12"> [The latest editions omit this clause as

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvi-p13">Seest thou how both when he bids them eat and when
they must abstain, he brings forward the same testimony? “For I
do not forbid,” saith he, “for this cause as though they
belonged to others: (“for the earth is the Lord’s:”)  but
for the reason I mentioned, for conscience sake; i.e., that it may
not be injured.” Ought one therefore to inquire scrupulously? 
“Nay” saith he “for I said not thy conscience, but his. For
I have already said, ‘for his sake that showed it.’” And
again, <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 10.29" id="iv.xxvi-p13.1" parsed="|1Cor|10|29|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.10.29">v. 29</scripRef>,

indeed, as is natural, thou sparest, and dost not suffer us to
taste for their sakes, lest their conscience being weak might be

I to do with judging them that are without?’ (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. v. 12" id="iv.xxvi-p14.1" parsed="|1Cor|5|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.5.12">1 Cor. v. 12</scripRef>.)

them?” “Not for him is my care,” he replies, “but in this
case also for thee.”  To which effect also he adds,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvi-p15">“For why is my liberty judged by another
conscience?” meaning by “liberty,” that which is left without
caution or prohibition. For this is liberty, freed from Jewish
bondage. And what he means is this: “God hath made me free
and above all reach of injury, but the Gentile knoweth not how to
judge of my rule of life, nor to see into the liberality of my
Master, but will condemn and say to himself, ‘Christianity is a
fable; they abstain from the idols, they shun demons, and yet
cleave to the things offered to them: great is their
gluttony.’” “And what then?” it may be said. “What
harm is it to us, should he judge us unfairly?” But how much
better to give him no room to judge at all!  For if thou abstain,
he will not even say this. “How,” say you, “will he not say
it? For when he seeth me not making these inquiries, either in
the shambles or in the banquet; what should hinder him from using
this language and condemning me, as one who partakes without
discrimination?” It is not so at all. For thou partakest, not
as of idol-sacrifices, but as of things clean. And if thou makest
no nice enquiry, it is that thou mayest signify that thou fearest
not the things set before thee; this being the reason why, whether
thou enterest a house of Gentiles or goest into the market, I
suffer thee not to ask questions; viz. lest thou become timid<note place="end" n="129" id="iv.xxvi-p15.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxvi-p16"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxvi-p16.1">ψοφοδεὴς</span>.</p></note> and

why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?”
“Of what dost thou ‘by grace partake?’ tell me.” Of the
gifts of God. For His grace is so great, as to render my soul
unstained and above all pollution. For as the sun sending down
his beams upon many spots of pollution, withdraws them again pure;
so likewise and much more, we, living in the midst of the world
remain pure, if we will, by how much the power we have is even
greater than his. “Why then abstain?” say you. Not as
though I should become unclean, far from it; but for my brother’s
sake, and that I may not become a partaker with devils, and that I
may not be judged by the unbeliever. For in this case it is no

for our customs; they are a kind of hypocrites, abusing the demons
and loathing them, yet running to their tables; than which what can
be more senseless? We conclude that not for truth’s sake, but
through ambition and love of power they have betaken themselves to
this doctrine.’ What folly then would it be that in respect of
those things whereby I have been so benefited as even to give
solemn thanks, in respect of these I should become the cause of
evil-speaking?” “But these things, even as it is,” say you,
“will the Gentile allege, when he seeth me not making
enquiry.” In no wise. For all things are not full of
idol-sacrifices so that he should suspect this: nor dost thou
thyself taste of them as idol-sacrifices. But not then scrupulous
overmuch, nor again, on the other hand, when any say that it is an
idol-sacrifice, do thou partake. For Christ gave thee grace and
set thee on high and above all injury from that quarter, not that
thou mightest be evil spoken of, nor that the circumstance which
hath been such a gain to thee as to be matter of special
thanksgiving, should so injure others as to make them even
blaspheme. “Nay, why,” saith he, “do I not say to the
Gentile, ‘I eat, I am no wise injured, and I do not this as one
in friendship with the demons’?” Because thou canst not
persuade him, even though thou shouldst say it ten thousand
times: weak as he is and hostile. For if thy brother hath not
yet been persuaded by thee, much less the enemy and the Gentile.
If he is possessed by his consciousness of the idol-sacrifice, much
more the unbeliever. And besides, what occasion have we for so
great trouble?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvi-p20">“What then? whereas we have known Christ and give
thanks, while they blaspheme, shall we therefore abandon this
custom also?” Far from it. For the thing is not the same.
For in the one case, great is our gain from bearing the reproach;
but in the other, there will be no advantage. Wherefore also he
said before, “for neither if we eat, are we the better; nor if we
eat not, are we the worse.” (c. <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 8.8" id="iv.xxvi-p20.1" parsed="|1Cor|8|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.8.8">viii. 8</scripRef>.) And besides this too he
showed that the thing was to be avoided, so that even on another
ground ought they to be abstained from, not on this account only
but also for the other reasons which he assigned.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvi-p21">[3.] <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 10.31" id="iv.xxvi-p21.1" parsed="|1Cor|10|31|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.10.31">Ver. 31</scripRef>. “Whether therefore ye
eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of
God.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvi-p22">Perceivest thou how from the subject before him, he
carried out the exhortation to what was general, giving us one, the
most excellent of all <pb n="146" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_146.html" id="iv.xxvi-Page_146" />aims,
that God in all things should be glorified?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvi-p23"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 10.32" id="iv.xxvi-p23.1" parsed="|1Cor|10|32|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.10.32">Ver. 32</scripRef>. “Give no occasion of
stumbling, either to Jews, or to Greeks, or to the Church of
God:” i.e., give no handle to anyone: since in the case
supposed, both thy brother is offended, and the Jew will the more
hate and condemn thee, and the Gentile in like manner deride thee
even as a gluttonous man and a hypocrite.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvi-p24">Not only, however, should the brethren receive no
hurt from us, but to the utmost of our power not even those that
are without. For if we are “light,” and “leaven,” and
“luminaries,” and “salt,” we ought to enlighten, not to
darken; to bind, not to loosen; to draw to ourselves the
unbelievers, not to drive them away. Why then puttest thou to
flight those whom thou oughtest to draw to thee? Since even
Gentiles are hurt, when they see us reverting to such things: for
they know not our mind nor that our soul hath come to be above all
pollution of sense. And the Jews too, and the weaker brethren,
will suffer the same.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvi-p25">Seest thou how many reasons he hath assigned for
which we ought to abstain from the idol-sacrifices? Because of
their unprofitableness, because of their needlessness, because of
the injury to our brother, because of the evil-speaking of the Jew,
because of the reviling of the Gentile, because we ought not to be
partakers with demons, because the thing is a kind of idolatry.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvi-p26">Further, because he had said, “give no occasion of
stumbling,” and he made them responsible for the injury done,
both to the Gentiles and to the Jews; and the saying was grievous;
see how he renders it acceptable and light, putting himself
forward, and saying,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvi-p27"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 10.33" id="iv.xxvi-p27.1" parsed="|1Cor|10|33|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.10.33">Ver. 33</scripRef>. “Even as I also please
all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the profit
of the many, that they may be saved.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvi-p28"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 11.1" id="iv.xxvi-p28.1" parsed="|1Cor|11|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.11.1">Chap. xi. ver. 1</scripRef>. “Be ye imitators of me,
even as I also am of Christ.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvi-p29">This is a rule of the most perfect Christianity,
this is a landmark exactly laid down, this is the point that stands
highest of all; viz. the seeking those things which are for the
common profit: which also Paul himself declared, by adding,
“even as I also am of Christ.” For nothing can so make a man
an imitator of Christ as caring for his neighbors. Nay, though
thou shouldest fast, though thou shouldest lie upon the ground, and
even strangle thyself, but take no thought for thy neighbor; thou
hast wrought nothing great, but still standest far from this Image,
while so doing. However, in the case before us, even the very
thing itself is naturally useful, viz; the abstaining from
idol-sacrifices. But “I,” saith he, “have done many of
those things which were unprofitable also: e.g., when I used
circumcision, when I offered sacrifice; for these, were any one to
examine them in themselves, rather destroy those that follow after
them and cause them to fall from salvation: nevertheless, I
submitted even to these on account of the advantage therefrom: 
but here is no such thing. For in that case, except there accrue
a certain benefit and except they be done for others’ sake, then
the thing becomes injurious: but in this, though there be none
made to stumble, even so ought one to abstain from the things
forbidden.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvi-p30">But not only to things hurtful have I submitted, but
also to things toilsome. For, “I robbed other Churches,”
saith he, “taking wages of them; (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. xi. 8" id="iv.xxvi-p30.1" parsed="|2Cor|11|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.11.8">2 Cor. xi. 8</scripRef>.) and when it was lawful to
eat and not to work, I sought not this, but chose to perish of
hunger rather than offend another.” This is why he says, “I
please all men in all things.” “Though it be against the law,
though it be laborious and hazardous, which is to be done, I endure
all for the profit of others. So then, being above all in
perfection, he became beneath all in condescension.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvi-p31">[4.] For no virtuous action can be very exalted,
when it doth not distribute its benefit to others also: as is
shown by him who brought the one talent safe, and was cut in sunder
because he had not made more of it. And thou then, brother,
though thou shouldest remain without food, though thou shouldest
sleep upon the ground, though thou shouldest eat ashes and be ever
wailing, and do good to no other; thou wilt do no great work. For
so also those great and noble persons who were in the beginning
made this their chiefest care: examine accurately their life, and
thou wilt see clearly that none of them ever looked to his own
things, but each one to the things of his neighbor, whence also
they shone the brighter. For so Moses (to mention him first)
wrought many and great wonders and signs; but nothing made him so
great as that blessed voice which he uttered unto God, saying,
“If Thou wilt forgive their sin,” forgive; “but if not, blot
me also out.” (<scripRef passage="Exod. xxxii. 32" id="iv.xxvi-p31.1" parsed="|Exod|32|32|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Exod.32.32">Exod.
xxxii. 32</scripRef>.) Such too
was David: wherefore also he said, “I the shepherd have sinned,
and I have done wickedly, but these, the flock, what have they
done? Let Thine hand be upon me and upon my father’s
house.” (<scripRef passage="2 Sam. xxiv. 17" id="iv.xxvi-p31.2" parsed="|2Sam|24|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Sam.24.17">2 Sam. xxiv.
17</scripRef>.) So likewise
Abraham sought not his own profit, but the profit of many.
Wherefore he both exposed himself to dangers and besought God for
those who in no wise belonged to him.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvi-p32">Well: these indeed so became glorious. But as
for those who sought their own, consider what harm too they
received. The nephew, for instance, of the last mentioned,
because he listened to the saying, “If thou wilt go to the right,
<pb n="147" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_147.html" id="iv.xxvi-Page_147" />I will go to the left;”
(<scripRef passage="Gen. xiii. 9" id="iv.xxvi-p32.1" parsed="|Gen|13|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.13.9">Gen. xiii. 9</scripRef>.) and accepting the choice,
sought his own profit, did not even find his own: but this region
was burned up, while that remained untouched. Jonah again, not
seeking the profit of many, but his own, was in danger even of
perishing: and while the city stood fast, he himself was tossed
about and overwhelmed in the sea. But when he sought the profit
of many, then he also found his own. So likewise Jacob among the
flocks, not seeking his own gain, had exceeding riches for his
portion. And Joseph also, seeking the profit of his brethren,
found his own. At least, being sent by his father, (<scripRef passage="Gen. xxxvii. 14" id="iv.xxvi-p32.2" parsed="|Gen|37|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.37.14">Gen. xxxvii. 14</scripRef>.) he said not, “What is
this? Hast thou not heard that for a vision and certain dreams
they even attempted to tear me in pieces, and I was held
responsible for my dreams, and suffer punishment for being beloved
of thee? What then will they not do when they get me in the midst
of them?” He said none of these things, he thought not of them,
but prefers the care of his brethren above all. Therefore he
enjoyed also all the good things which followed, which both made
him very brilliant and declared him glorious. Thus also
Moses,—for nothing hinders that we should a second time make
mention of him, and behold how he overlooked his own things and
sought the things of others:—I say this Moses, being conversant
in a king’s court, because he “counted the reproach of Christ
(<scripRef passage="Heb. xi. 26" id="iv.xxvi-p32.3" parsed="|Heb|11|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Heb.11.26">Heb. xi. 26</scripRef>.) greater riches than the
treasures of Egypt;” and having cast them even all out of his
hands, became a partaker of the afflictions of the Hebrews;—so
far from being himself enslaved, he liberated them also from
bondage.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvi-p33">Well: these surely are great things and worthy of
an angelical life. But the conduct of Paul far exceeds this.
For all the rest leaving their own blessings chose to be partakers
in the afflictions of others: but Paul did a thing much
greater. For it was not that he consented to be a partaker in
others’ misfortunes, but he chose himself to be at all
extremities that other men might enjoy blessings. Now it is not
the same for one who lives in luxury to cast away his luxury and
suffer adversity, as for one himself alone suffering adversity, to
cause others to be in security and honor. For in the former case,
though it be a great thing to exchange prosperity for affliction
for your neighbor’s sake, nevertheless it brings some consolation
to have partakers in the misfortune. But consenting to be himself
alone in the distress that others may enjoy their good
things,—this belongs to a much more energetic soul, and to
Paul’s own spirit.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvi-p34">And not by this only, but by another and greater
excellency doth he surpass all those before mentioned. That is,
Abraham and all the rest exposed themselves to dangers in the
present life, and all these were but asking for this kind of death
once for all: but Paul prayed (<scripRef passage="Rom. ix. 3" id="iv.xxvi-p34.1" parsed="|Rom|9|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.9.3">Rom. ix. 3</scripRef>.) that he might fall
from the glory of the world to come for the sake of others’
salvation.<note place="end" n="131" id="iv.xxvi-p34.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxvi-p35"> [But the Apostle did not say absolutely “I
wish,” but “I could wish” or pray. The difference is
great. C.]</p></note></p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvi-p36">I may mention also a third point of superiority.
And what is this? That some of those, though they interceded for
the persons who conspired against them, nevertheless it was for
those with whose guidance they had been entrusted: and the same
thing happened as if one should stand up for a wild and lawless
son, but still a son: whereas Paul wished to be accursed in the
stead of those with whose guardianship he was not entrusted. For
to the Gentiles was he sent. Dost thou perceive the greatness of
his soul and the loftiness of his spirit, transcending the very
heaven? This man do thou emulate: but if thou canst not, at
least follow those who shone in the old covenant. For thus shalt
thou find thine own profit, if thou seekest that of thy neighbor.
Wherefore when thou feelest backward to care for thy brother,
considering that no otherwise canst thou be saved, at least for
thine own sake stand thou up for him and his interests.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvi-p37">[5.] And although what hath been said is
sufficient to convince thee that no otherwise is it possible to
secure our own benefit: yet if thou wouldst also assure thyself
of it by the examples of common life, conceive a fire happening any
where to be kindled in a house, and then some of the neighbors with
a view to their own interest refusing to confront the danger but
shutting themselves up and remaining at home, in fear lest some one
find his way in and purloin some part of the household goods; how
great punishment will they endure? Since the fire will come on
and burn down likewise all that is theirs; and because they looked
not to the profit of their neighbor, they lose even their own
besides. For so God, willing to bind us all to each other, hath
imposed upon things such a necessity, that in the profit of one
neighbor that of the other is bound up; and the whole world is thus
constituted. And therefore in a vessel too, if a storm come on,
and the steersman, leaving the profit of the many, should seek his
own only, he will quickly sink both himself and them. And of each
several art too we may say that should it look to its own profit
only, life could never stand, nor even the art itself which so
seeketh its own. Therefore the husbandman sows not so much corn
only as is sufficient for himself, since he would long ago have
famished both himself and others; but seeks the profit of the
many: and the soldier <pb n="148" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_148.html" id="iv.xxvi-Page_148" />takes
the field against dangers, not that he may save himself, but that
he may also place his cities in security: and the merchant brings
not home so much as may be sufficient for himself alone, but for
many others also.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvi-p38">Now if any say, “each man doeth this, not looking
to my interest, but his own, for he engages in all these things to
obtain for himself money and glory and security, so that in seeking
my profit he seeks his own:” this also do I say and long since
wished to hear from you, and for this have I framed all my
discourse; viz. to signify that thy neighbor then seeks his own
profit, when he looks to thine. For since men would no otherwise
make up their mind to seek the things of their neighbor, except
they were reduced to this necessity; therefore God hath thus joined
things together, and suffers them not to arrive at their own profit
except they first travel through the profit of others.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvi-p39">Well then, this is natural to man, thus to follow
after his neighbors’ advantage; but one ought to be persuaded not
from this reason, but from what pleases God. For it is not
possible to be saved, wanting this; but though thou shouldest
exercise the highest perfection of the work and neglect others who
are perishing, thou wilt gain no confidence towards God. Whence
is this evident? From what the blessed Paul declared. “For if
I bestow my goods to feed the poor, and give my body to be burned,
and have not love, it profiteth me nothing,” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. xiii. 3" id="iv.xxvi-p39.1" parsed="|1Cor|13|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.13.3">1 Cor. xiii. 3</scripRef>.) saith he. Seeth thou
how much Paul requireth of us? And yet he that bestowed his goods
to feed the poor, sought not his own good, but that of his
neighbor. But this alone is not enough, he saith. For he would
have it done with sincerity and much sympathy. For therefore also
God made it a law that he might bring us into the bond of love.
When therefore He demands so large a measure, and we do not render
even that which is less, of what indulgence shall we be worthy?<note place="end" n="132" id="iv.xxvi-p39.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxvi-p40"> [This passage and others like it show, as
Neander says, that while Chrysostom was enthusiastically alive to
the ideal of holy temper and holy living in Monachism, yet he was
too deeply penetrated by the essence of the Gospel not to be aware
that this indeed should pervade <i>all the relations of life</i>.
C.]</p></note></p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvi-p41">“And how,” saith one, “did God say to Lot by
the Angels, ‘Escape for thy life?’” (<scripRef passage="Gen. xix. 17" id="iv.xxvi-p41.1" parsed="|Gen|19|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.19.17">Gen. xix. 17</scripRef>.) Say, when, and why. When
the punishment was brought near, not when there was an opportunity
of correction but when they were condemned and incurably diseased,
and old and young had rushed into the same passions, and henceforth
they must needs be burned up, and in that day when the thunderbolts
were about to be launched. And besides, this was not spoken of
vice and virtue but of the chastisement inflicted by God. For
what was he to do, tell me? Sit still and await the punishment,
and without at all profiting them, be burned up? Nay, this were
the extremest folly.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvi-p42">For I do not affirm this, that one ought to bring
chastisement on one’s self without discrimination and at random,
apart from the will of God. But when a man tarries long in sin,
then I bid thee push thyself forward and correct him: if thou
wilt, for thy neighbor’s sake: but if not, at least for thine
own profit. It is true, the first is the better course: but if
thou reachest not yet unto that height, do it even for this. And
let no man seek his own that he may find his own; and bearing in
mind that neither voluntary poverty nor martyrdom, nor any other
thing, can testify in our favor, unless we have the crowning virtue
of love; let us preserve this beyond the rest, that through it we
may also obtain all other, both present and promised blessings; at
which may we all arrive through the grace and mercy of our Lord
Jesus Christ; Whom be the glory world without end. Amen.</p>

<p class="c24" id="iv.xxvii-p4"><span class="c18" id="iv.xxvii-p4.1">Having</span> completed the
discourse concerning the idol-sacrifices as became him, and having
rendered it most perfect in all respects, he proceeds to another
thing, which also itself was a complaint, but not so great a one.
For that which I said before, this do I also now say, that he doth
not set down all the heavy accusations continuously, but after
disposing them in due order, he inserts among them the lighter
matters, mitigating what the readers would else feel offensive in
his discourse on account of his continually reproving.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvii-p5"><pb n="149" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_149.html" id="iv.xxvii-Page_149" />Wherefore also
he set the most serious of all last, that relating to the
resurrection. But for the present he goes to another, a lighter
thing, saying, “Now I praise you that ye remember me in all
things.” Thus when the offence is admitted, he both accuses
vehemently and threatens: but when it is questioned, he first
proves it and then rebukes. And what was admitted, he
aggravates: but what was likely to be disputed, he shows to be
admitted. Their fornication, for instance, was a thing
admitted. Wherefore there was no need to show that there was an
offence; but in that case he proved the magnitude of the
transgression, and conducted his discourse by way of comparison.
Again, their going to law before aliens was an offence, but not so
great a one. Wherefore he considered by the way, and proved it.
The matter of the idol-sacrifices again was questioned. It was
however, a most serious evil. Wherefore he both shows it to be an
offence, and amplifies it by his discourse. But when he doeth
this, he not only withdraws them from the several crimes, but
invites them also to their contraries. Thus he said not only that
one must not commit fornication, but likewise that one ought to
exhibit great holiness. Wherefore he added, “Therefore glorify
God in your body, and in your spirit.” (c. 
<scripRef passage="1 Cor. 6.20" id="iv.xxvii-p5.1" parsed="|1Cor|6|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.6.20">vi. 20</scripRef>.) And having said again that
one ought not to be wise with the wisdom that is without, he is not
content with this, but bids him also to “become a fool.” (c.
<scripRef passage="1 Cor. 3.18" id="iv.xxvii-p5.2" parsed="|1Cor|3|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.3.18">iii.
18</scripRef>.) And where he
advises them not to go to law before them that are without, and to
do no wrong; he goeth further, and takes away even the very going
to law, and counsels them not only to do no wrong, but even to
suffer wrong. (c. <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 6.7,8" id="iv.xxvii-p5.3" parsed="|1Cor|6|7|6|8" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.6.7-1Cor.6.8">vi. 7, 8</scripRef>.)</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvii-p6">And discoursing concerning the idol-sacrifices, he
said not that one ought to abstain from things forbidden only, but
also from things permitted when offence is given: and not only
not to hurt the brethren, but not even Greeks, nor Jews. Thus,
“give no occasion of stumbling,” saith he, “either to Jews,
or to Greeks, or to the Church of God.” (c. 
<scripRef passage="1 Cor. 10.32" id="iv.xxvii-p6.1" parsed="|1Cor|10|32|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.10.32">x. 32</scripRef>.)</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvii-p7">[2.] Having finished therefore all the
discourses concerning all these things, he next proceeds also to
another accusation. And what was this? Their women used both to
pray and prophesy unveiled and with their head bare, (for then
women also used to prophesy;) but the men went so far as to wear
long hair as having spent their time in philosophy<note place="end" n="133" id="iv.xxvii-p7.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxvii-p8"> To let the hair and beard grow was a token of
devotion to any study; as Poetry, Hor. <i>A. P.</i> 297;
Philosophy, as it is told of Julian the Apostate that it was part
of his affectation to let his hair and beard grow.</p></note>, and covered
their heads when praying and prophesying, each of which was a
Grecian custom. Since then he had already admonished them
concerning these things when present, and some perhaps listened to
him and others disobeyed; therefore in his letter also again, he
foments the place, like a physician, by his mode of addressing
them, and so corrects the offence. For that he had heretofore
admonished them in person is evident from what he begins with.
Why else, having said nothing of this matter any where in the
Epistle before, but passing on from other accusations, doth he
straightway say, “Now I praise you that ye remember me in all
things, and hold fast the traditions, even as I delivered them to
you?”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvii-p9">Thou seest that some obeyed, whom he praises; and
others disobeyed, whom he corrects by what comes afterwards,
saying, “Now if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such
custom.” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. 11.16" id="iv.xxvii-p9.1" parsed="|1Cor|11|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.11.16">ver. 16</scripRef>.) For if after some had done
well but others disobeyed, he had included all in his accusation,
he would both have made the one sort bolder, and have caused the
others to become more remiss; whereas now by praising and approving
the one, and rebuking the other, he both refreshes the one more
effectually, and causes the other to shrink before him. For the
accusation even by itself was such as might well wound them; but
now that it takes place in contrast with others who have done well
and are praised, it comes with a sharper sting. However, for the
present he begins not with accusation, but with encomiums and great
encomiums, saying, “Now I praise you that ye remember me in all
things.” For such is the character of Paul; though it be but
for small matters he weaves a web of high praise; nor is it for
flattery that he doth so: far from it; how could he so act to
whom neither money was desirable, nor glory, nor any other such
thing? but for their salvation he orders all his proceedings. And
this is why he amplifies the encomium, saying, “Now I praise you
that ye remember me in all things.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvii-p10">All what things? For hitherto his discourse was
only concerning their not wearing long hair and not covering their
heads; but, as I said, he is very bountiful in his praises,
rendering them more forward. Wherefore he saith,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvii-p11">“That ye remember me in all things, and hold fast
the traditions, even as I delivered them to you.” It appears
then that he used at that time to deliver many things also not in
writing, which he shows too in many other places. But at that
time he only delivered them, whereas now he adds an explanation of
their reason: thus both rendering the one sort, the obedient,
more steadfast, and pulling down the others’ pride, who oppose
themselves. Further, he doth not say, “ye have obeyed, whilst
others disobeyed,” but without exciting suspicion, intimates it
by his mode of teaching in what follows, where he saith,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvii-p12"><pb n="150" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_150.html" id="iv.xxvii-Page_150" /><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 11.3" id="iv.xxvii-p12.1" parsed="|1Cor|11|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.11.3">Ver. 3</scripRef>. “But I would have ye
know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of every
woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvii-p13">This is his account of the reason of the
thing, and he states it to make the weaker more attentive. He
indeed that is faithful, as he ought to be, and steadfast, doth not
require any reason or cause of those things which are commanded
him, but is content with the ordinance<note place="end" n="134" id="iv.xxvii-p13.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxvii-p14"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxvii-p14.1">τῇ παραδόσει</span>.</p></note> alone. But he that is weaker,
when he also learns the cause, then both retains what is said with
more care and obeys with much readiness.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvii-p15">Wherefore neither did he state the cause until he
saw the commandment transgressed. What then is the cause? 
“The head of every man is Christ.” Is He then Head of the
Gentile also? In no wise. For if “we are the Body of Christ,
and severally members thereof,” (c. 
<scripRef passage="1 Cor. 12.27" id="iv.xxvii-p15.1" parsed="|1Cor|12|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.12.27">xii. 27</scripRef>.) and in this way He is our
head, He cannot be the head of them who are not in the Body and
rank not among the members. So that when he says, “of every
man,” one must understand it of the believer. Perceivest thou
how every where he appeals to the hearer’s shame by arguing from
on high? Thus both when he was discoursing on love, and when on
humility, and when on alms-giving, it was from thence that he drew
his examples.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvii-p16">[3.] “But the head of the woman is the
man; and the head of Christ is God.” Here the heretics rush
upon us with a certain declaration of inferiority, which out of
these words they contrive against the Son. But they stumble
against themselves. For if “the man be the head of the
woman,” and the head be of the same substance with the body, and
“the head of Christ is God,” the Son is of the same substance
with the Father. “Nay,” say they, “it is not His being of
another substance which we intend to show from hence, but that He
is under subjection.” What then are we to say to this? In the
first place, when any thing lowly is said of him conjoined as He is
with the Flesh, there is no disparagement of the Godhead in what is
said, the Economy admitting the expression. However, tell me how
thou intendest to prove this from the passage? “Why, as the man
governs the wife, saith he, “so also the Father, Christ.”
Therefore also as Christ governs the man, so likewise the Father,
the Son. “For the head of every man,” we read, “is
Christ.” And who could ever admit this? For if the
superiority of the Son compared with us, be the measure of the
Father’s compared with the Son, consider to what meanness thou
wilt bring Him. So that we must not try<note place="end" n="135" id="iv.xxvii-p16.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxvii-p17"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxvii-p17.1">ἐ</span><span class="Greek" id="iv.xxvii-p17.2">ξεταστέον</span>.</p></note> all things by like measure in
respect of ourselves and of God, though the language used
concerning them be similar; but we must assign to God a certain
appropriate excellency, and so great as belongs to God. For
should they not grant this, many absurdities will follow. As
thus; “the head of Christ is God:” and, “Christ is the head
of the man, and he of the woman.” Therefore if we choose to
take the term, “head,” in the like sense in all the clauses,
the Son will be as far removed from the Father as we are from
Him. Nay, and the woman will be as far removed from us as we are
from the Word of God. And what the Son is to the Father, this
both we are to the Son and the woman again to the man. And who
will endure this?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvii-p18">But dost thou understand the term “head”
differently in the case of the man and the woman, from what thou
dost in the case of Christ? Therefore in the case of the Father
and the Son, must we understand it differently also. “How
understand it differently?” saith the objector. According to
the occasion<note place="end" n="136" id="iv.xxvii-p18.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxvii-p19"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxvii-p19.1">τὸ αἴτιον</span>.</p></note>. For had
Paul meant to speak of rule and subjection, as thou sayest, he
would not have brought forward the instance of a wife, but rather
of a slave and a master. For what if the wife be under subjection
to us? it is as a wife, as free, as equal in honor. And the Son
also, though He did become obedient to the Father, it was as the
Son of God, it was as God. For as the obedience of the Son to the
Father is greater than we find in men towards the authors of their
being, so also His liberty is greater. Since it will not of
course be said that the circumstances of the Son’s relation to
the Father are greater and more intimate than among men, and of the
Father’s to the Son, less. For if we admire the Son that He was
obedient so as to come even unto death, and the death of the cross,
and reckon this the great wonder concerning Him; we ought to admire
the Father also, that He begat such a son, not as a slave under
command, but as free, yielding obedience and giving counsel. For
the counsellor is no slave. But again, when thou hearest of a
counsellor, do not understand it as though the Father were in need,
but that the Son hath the same honor with Him that begat Him. Do
not therefore strain the example of the man and the woman to all
particulars.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvii-p20">For with us indeed the woman is reasonably subjected
to the man: since equality of honor causeth contention. And not
for this cause only, but by reason also of the deceit (<scripRef passage="1 Tim. ii. 14" id="iv.xxvii-p20.1" parsed="|1Tim|2|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.2.14">1 Tim. ii. 14</scripRef>.) which happened in the
beginning. Wherefore you see, she was not subjected as soon as
she was made; nor, when He brought her to the man, did either she
hear any such thing from <pb n="151" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_151.html" id="iv.xxvii-Page_151" />God,
nor did the man say any such word to her: he said indeed that she
was “bone of his bone, and flesh of his flesh:” (<scripRef passage="Gen. ii. 23" id="iv.xxvii-p20.2" parsed="|Gen|2|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.2.23">Gen. ii. 23</scripRef>.) but of rule or subjection he
no where made mention unto her. But when she made an ill use of
her privilege and she who had been made a helper was found to be an
ensnarer and ruined all, then she is justly told for the future,
“thy turning shall be to thy husband.” (<scripRef passage="Gen. iii. 16" id="iv.xxvii-p20.3" parsed="|Gen|3|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.3.16">Gen. iii. 16</scripRef>.)</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvii-p21">To account for which; it was likely that this sin
would have thrown our race into a state of warfare; (for her having
been made out of him would not have contributed any thing to peace,
when this had happened, nay, rather this very thing would have made
the man even the harsher, that she made as she was out of him
should not have spared even him who was a member of herself:) 
wherefore God, considering the malice of the Devil, raised up the
bulwark of this word and what enmity was likely to arise from his
evil device, He took away by means of this sentence and by the
desire implanted in us: thus pulling down the partition-wall,
i.e., the resentment caused by that sin of hers. But in God and
in that undefiled Essence, one must not suppose any such thing.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvii-p22">Do not therefore apply the examples to all, since
elsewhere also from this source many grievous errors will occur.
For so in the beginning of this very Epistle, he said, (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. iii. 22, 23" id="iv.xxvii-p22.1" parsed="|1Cor|3|22|3|23" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.3.22-1Cor.3.23">1 Cor. iii. 22, 23</scripRef>.) “All are yours, and ye are
Christ’s, and Christ is God’s.” What then? Are all in
like manner ours, as “we are Christ’s, and Christ is
God’s?” In no wise, but even to the very simple the
difference is evident, although the same expression is used of God,
and Christ, and us. And elsewhere also having called the husband
“head of the wife,” he added, (<scripRef passage="Ephes. v. 23" id="iv.xxvii-p22.2" parsed="|Eph|5|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Eph.5.23">Ephes. v. 23</scripRef>.) “Even as Christ is Head
and Saviour and Defender of the Church, so also ought the man to be
of his own wife.” Are we then to understand in like manner the
saying in the text, both this, and all that after this is written
to the Ephesians concerning this subject? Far from it. It is
impossible. For although the same words are spoken of God and of
men, they do not have the same force in respect to God and to men,
but in one way those must be understood, and in another these.
Not however on the other hand all things diversely: since
contrariwise they will seem to have been introduced at random and
in vain, we reaping no benefit from them. But as we must not
receive all things alike, so neither must we absolutely reject
all.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvii-p23">Now that what I say may become clearer, I will
endeavor to make it manifest in an example. Christ is called
“the Head of the Church.” If I am to take nothing from what
is human in the idea, why, I would know, is the expression used at
all? On the other hand, if I understand all in that way, extreme
absurdity will result. For the head is of like passions with the
body and liable to the same things. What then ought we to let go,
and what to accept? We should let go these particulars which I
have mentioned, but accept the notion of a perfect union, and the
first principle; and not even these ideas absolutely, but here also
we must form a notion, as we may by ourselves, of that which is too
high for us and suitable to the Godhead: for both the union is
surer and the beginning more honorable.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvii-p24">Again, thou hearest the word “Son;” do not thou
in this case admit all particulars; yet neither oughtest thou to
reject all: but admitting whatever is meet for God, e.g. that He
is of the same essence, that He is of God; the things which are
incongruous and belong to human weakness, leave thou upon the
earth.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvii-p25">Again, God is called “Light.” Shall we then
admit all circumstances which belong to natural light? In no
wise. For this light yields to darkness, and is circumscribed by
space, and is moved by another power, and is overshadowed; none of
which it is lawful even to imagine of That Essence. We will not
however reject all things on this account, but will reap something
useful from the example. The illumination which cometh to us from
God, the deliverance from darkness, this will be what we gather
from it.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvii-p26">[4.] Thus much in answer to the heretics: but we
must also orderly go over the whole passage. For perhaps some one
might here have doubt also, questioning with himself, what sort of
a crime it was for the woman to be uncovered, or the man covered? 
What sort of crime it is, learn now from hence.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvii-p27">Symbols many and diverse have been given both to man
and woman; to him of rule, to her of subjection: and among them
this also, that she should be covered, while he hath his head
bare. If now these be symbols you see that both err when they
disturb the proper order, and transgress the disposition of God,
and their own proper limits, both the man falling into the
woman’s inferiority, and the woman rising up against the man by
her outward habiliments.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvii-p28">For if exchange of garments be not lawful, so that
neither she should be clad with a cloak, nor he with a mantle or a
veil: (“for the woman,” saith He, “shall not wear that
which pertaineth to a man, neither shall a man put on a woman’s
garments:”)  much more is it unseemly for these (<scripRef passage="Deut. xxii. 5" id="iv.xxvii-p28.1" parsed="|Deut|22|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Deut.22.5">Deut. xxii. 5</scripRef>.) things to be interchanged.
For the former indeed were ordained by men, even although God
afterwards ratified them: but this by nature, I mean the being
covered or uncovered. But when I say Nature, I mean God. For He
it is Who created Nature. When 
<pb n="152" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_152.html" id="iv.xxvii-Page_152" />therefore thou overturnest these boundaries, see
how great injuries ensue.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvii-p29">And tell me not this, that the error is but small.
For first, it is great even of itself: being as it is
disobedience. Next, though it were small, it became great because
of the greatness of the things whereof it is a sign. However,
that it is a great matter, is evident from its ministering so
effectually to good order among mankind, the governor and the
governed being regularly kept in their several places by it.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvii-p30"> So that he who transgresseth disturbs all things,
and betrays the gifts of God, and casts to the ground the honor
bestowed on him from above; not however the man only, but also the
woman. For to her also it is the greatest of honors to preserve
her own rank; as indeed of disgraces, the behavior of a rebel.
Wherefore he laid it down concerning both, thus saying,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvii-p31"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 11.4" id="iv.xxvii-p31.1" parsed="|1Cor|11|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.11.4">Ver. 4</scripRef>.
“Every man praying or prophesying having his head covered,
dishonoreth his head. But every woman praying or prophesying with
her head unveiled dishonoreth her head.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvii-p32">For there were, as I said, both men who prophesied
and women who had this gift at that time, as the daughters of
Philip, (<scripRef passage="Acts xxi. 9" id="iv.xxvii-p32.1" parsed="|Acts|21|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.21.9">Acts xxi. 9</scripRef>.) as others before them and
after them: concerning whom also the prophet spake of old: 
“your sons shall prophesy, and your daughters shall see
visions.” (<scripRef passage="Joel ii. 28; Acts 2.17" id="iv.xxvii-p32.2" parsed="|Joel|2|28|0|0;|Acts|2|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Joel.2.28 Bible:Acts.2.17">Joel ii. 28. Acts ii. 17</scripRef>.)</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvii-p33">Well then: the man he compelleth not to be always
uncovered, but only when he prays. “For every man,” saith he,
“praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoreth his
head.” But the woman he commands to be at all times covered.
Wherefore also having said, “Every woman that prayeth or
prophesieth with her head unveiled, dishonoreth her head,” he
stayed not at this point only, but also proceeded to say, “for it
is one and the same thing as if she were shaven.” But if to be
shaven is always dishonorable, it is plain too that being uncovered
is always a reproach. And not even with this only was he content,
but added again, saying, “The woman ought to have a sign of
authority on her head, because of the angels.” He signifies
that not at the time of prayer only but also continually, she ought
to be covered. But with regard to the man, it is no longer about
covering but about wearing long hair, that he so forms his
discourse. To be covered he then only forbids, when a man is
praying; but the wearing long hair he discourages at all times.
Wherefore, as touching the woman, he said, “But if she be not
veiled, let her also be shorn;” so likewise touching the man,
“If he have long hair, it is a dishonor unto him.” He said
not, “if he be covered” but, “if he have long hair.”
Wherefore also he said at the beginning, “Every man praying or
prophesying, having any thing on his head, dishonoreth his
head.” He said not, “covered,” but “having any thing on
his head;” signifying that even though he pray with the head
bare, yet if he have long hair, he is like to one covered. “For
the hair,” saith he, “is given for a covering.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvii-p34"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 11.6" id="iv.xxvii-p34.1" parsed="|1Cor|11|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.11.6">Ver. 6</scripRef>.
“But if a woman is not veiled, let her also be shorn: but if it
be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be
veiled.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvii-p35">Thus, in the beginning he simply requires that
the head be not bare: but as he proceeds he intimates both the
continuance of the rule, saying, “for it is one and the same
thing as if she were shaven,” and the keeping of it with all care
and diligence. For he said not merely covered, but “covered
over<note place="end" n="137" id="iv.xxvii-p35.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxvii-p36"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxvii-p36.1">οὐδὲ γὰρ καλύπτεσθαι, ἀλλα
κατακαλύπτεσθαι</span>.</p></note>,” meaning
that she be carefully wrapped up on every side. And by reducing
it to an absurdity, he appeals to their shame, saying by way of
severe reprimand, “but if she be not covered, let her also be
shorn.” As if he had said, “If thou cast away the covering
appointed by the law of God, cast away likewise that appointed by
nature.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvii-p37">But if any say, “Nay, how can this be a shame to
the woman, if she mount up to the glory of the man?” we might
make this answer; “She doth not mount up, but rather falls from
her own proper honor.” Since not to abide within our own limits
and the laws ordained of God, but to go beyond, is not an addition
but a diminuation. For as he that desireth other men’s goods
and seizeth what is not his own, hath not gained any thing more,
but is diminished, having lost even that which he had, (which kind
of thing also happened in paradise:)  so likewise the woman
acquireth not the man’s dignity, but loseth even the woman’s
decency which she had. And not from hence only is her shame and
reproach, but also on account of her covetousness.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvii-p38">Having taken then what was confessedly shameful, and
having said, “but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or
shaven,” he states in what follows his own conclusion, saying,
“let her be covered.” And he said not, “let her have long
hair,” but, “let her be covered,” ordaining both these to be
one, and establishing them both ways, from what was customary and
from their contraries: in that he both affirms the covering and
the hair to be one, and also that she again who is shaven is the
same with her whose head is bare. “For it is one and the same
thing,” saith he, “as if she were shaven.” But if any say,
“And how is it one, if this woman have the covering of nature,
but the other who is shaven have not even this?” we answer, that
as far as her will goes, she threw 
<pb n="153" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_153.html" id="iv.xxvii-Page_153" />that off likewise by having the head bare. And
if it be not bare of tresses, that is nature’s doing, not her
own. So that as she who is shaven hath her head bare, so this
woman in like manner. For this cause He left it to nature to
provide her with a covering, that even of it she might learn this
lesson and veil herself.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvii-p39">Then he states also a cause, as one discoursing with
those who are free: a thing which in many places I have
remarked. What then is the cause?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvii-p40"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 11.7" id="iv.xxvii-p40.1" parsed="|1Cor|11|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.11.7">Ver. 7</scripRef>.
“For a man indeed ought not to have his head veiled, forasmuch as
he is the image and glory of God.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvii-p41">This is again another cause. “Not only,” so he
speaks, “because he hath Christ to be His Head ought he not to
cover the head, but because also he rules over the woman.” For
the ruler when he comes before the king ought to have the symbol of
his rule. As therefore no ruler without military girdle and
cloak, would venture to appear before him that hath the diadem: 
so neither do thou without the symbols of thy rule, (one of which
is the not being covered,) pray before God, lest thou insult both
thyself and Him that hath honored thee.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvii-p42">And the same thing likewise one may say regarding
the woman. For to her also is it a reproach, the not having the
symbols of her subjection. “But the woman is the glory of the
man.” Therefore the rule of the man is natural.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvii-p43">[5.] Then, having affirmed his point, he states
again other reasons and causes also, leading thee to the first
creation, and saying thus:</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvii-p44"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 11.8" id="iv.xxvii-p44.1" parsed="|1Cor|11|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.11.8">Ver. 8</scripRef>.
“For the man is not of the woman, but the woman of the
man.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvii-p45">But if to be of any one, is a glory to him of whom
one is, much more the being an image of him.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvii-p46"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 11.9" id="iv.xxvii-p46.1" parsed="|1Cor|11|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.11.9">Ver. 9</scripRef>.
“For neither was the man created for the woman, but the woman for
the man.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvii-p47">This is again a second superiority, nay, rather also
a third, and a fourth, the first being, that Christ is the head of
us, and we of the woman; a second, that we are the glory of God,
but the woman of us; a third, that we are not of the woman, but she
of us; a fourth, that we are not for her, but she for us.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvii-p48"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 11.10" id="iv.xxvii-p48.1" parsed="|1Cor|11|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.11.10">Ver. 10</scripRef>. “For this cause ought the
woman to have a sign of authority on her head.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvii-p49">“For this cause:” what cause, tell me? 
“For all these which have been mentioned,” saith he; or rather
not for these only, but also “because of the angels.” “For
although thou despise thine husband,” saith he, “yet reverence
the angels.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvii-p50">It follows that being covered is a mark of
subjection and authority. For it induces her to look down and be
ashamed and preserve entire her proper virtue. For the virtue and
honor of the governed is to abide in his obedience.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvii-p51">Again: the man is not compelled to do this; for he
is the image of his Lord: but the woman is; and that
reasonably. Consider then the excess of the transgression when
being honored with so high a prerogative, thou puttest thyself to
shame, seizing the woman’s dress. And thou doest the same as if
having received a diadem, thou shouldest cast the diadem from thy
head, and instead of it take a slave’s garment.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvii-p52"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 11.11" id="iv.xxvii-p52.1" parsed="|1Cor|11|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.11.11">Ver. 11</scripRef>. “Nevertheless, neither is
the man without the woman, nor the woman without the man, in the
Lord.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvii-p53">Thus, because he had given great superiority to the
man, having said that the woman is of him and for him and under
him; that he might neither lift up the men more than was due nor
depress the women, see how he brings in the correction, saying,
“Howbeit neither is the man without the woman, nor the woman
without the man, in the Lord.” “Examine not, I pray,” saith
he, “the first things only, and that creation. Since if thou
enquire into what comes after, each one of the two is the cause of
the other; or rather not even thus each of the other, but God of
all.” Wherefore he saith, “neither is the man without the
woman, nor the woman without the man, in the Lord.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvii-p54"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 11.12" id="iv.xxvii-p54.1" parsed="|1Cor|11|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.11.12">Ver. 12</scripRef>. “For as the woman is of
the man, so is the man also by the woman.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvii-p55">He said not, “of the woman,” but he repeats the
expression, (from <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 11.7" id="iv.xxvii-p55.1" parsed="|1Cor|11|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.11.7">v. 7</scripRef>.)
“of the man.” For still this particular prerogative remains
entire with the man. Yet are not these excellencies the property
of the man, but of God. Wherefore also he adds, “but all things
of God.” If therefore all things belong to God, and he commands
these things, do thou obey and gainsay not.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvii-p56"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 11.13" id="iv.xxvii-p56.1" parsed="|1Cor|11|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.11.13">Ver. 13</scripRef>. “Judge ye in
yourselves: is it seemly that a woman pray unto God veiled?”
Again he places them as judges of the things said, which also he
did respecting the idol-sacrifices. For as there he saith,
“judge ye what I say:” (c. <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 10.15" id="iv.xxvii-p56.2" parsed="|1Cor|10|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.10.15">x. 15</scripRef>.) so here, “judge in
yourselves:” and he hints something more awful here. For he
says that the affront here passes on unto God: although thus
indeed he doth not express himself, but in something of a milder
and more enigmatical form of speech: “is it seemly that a woman
pray unto God unveiled?”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvii-p57"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 11.14" id="iv.xxvii-p57.1" parsed="|1Cor|11|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.11.14">Ver. 14</scripRef>. “Doth not even nature
itself teach you, that if a man have long hair, it is a dishonor
unto him?”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvii-p58"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 11.15" id="iv.xxvii-p58.1" parsed="|1Cor|11|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.11.15">Ver. 15</scripRef>. “But if a woman have long
hair, it is a glory to her; for her hair is given her for a
covering.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvii-p59">His constant practice of stating commonly <pb n="154" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_154.html" id="iv.xxvii-Page_154" />received reasons he adopts also in
this place, betaking himself to the common custom, and greatly
abashing those who waited to be taught these things from him, which
even from men’s ordinary practice they might have learned. For
such things are not unknown even to Barbarians: and see how he
every where deals in piercing expressions: “every man praying
having his head covered dishonoreth his head;” and again, “but
if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be
veiled:” and here again, “if a man have long hair, it is a
shame unto him; but if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to
her, for her hair is given her for a covering.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvii-p60">“And if it be given her for a covering,”
say you, “wherefore need she add another covering?” That not
nature only, but also her own will may have part in her
acknowledgment of subjection. For that thou oughtest to be
covered nature herself by anticipation enacted a law. Add now, I
pray, thine own part also, that thou mayest not seem to subvert the
very laws of nature; a proof of most insolent rashness<note place="end" n="138" id="iv.xxvii-p60.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxvii-p61"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxvii-p61.1">ἰ</span><span class="Greek" id="iv.xxvii-p61.2">ταμότητος</span>.</p></note>, to buffet
not only with us, but with nature also. This is why God accusing
the Jews said, (<scripRef passage="Ezek. xvi. 21, 22" id="iv.xxvii-p61.3" parsed="|Ezek|16|21|16|22" osisRef="Bible:Ezek.16.21-Ezek.16.22">Ezek. xvi. 21, 22</scripRef>.) “Thou hast slain thy
sons and thy daughters: this is beyond all thy abominations.”<note place="end" n="139" id="iv.xxvii-p61.4"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxvii-p62"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxvii-p62.1">βδελύγματα</span>. rec. text.
<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxvii-p62.2">πορνείαν</span>.</p></note></p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvii-p63">And again, Paul rebuking the unclean among the
Romans thus aggravates the accusation, saying, that their usage was
not only against the law of God, but even against nature. “For
they changed the natural use into that which is against
nature.” (<scripRef passage="Rom. i. 26" id="iv.xxvii-p63.1" parsed="|Rom|1|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.1.26">Rom. i.
26</scripRef>.) For this
cause then here also he employs this argument signifying this very
thing, both that he is not enacting any strange law and that among
Gentiles their inventions would all be reckoned as a kind of
novelty against nature.<note place="end" n="140" id="iv.xxvii-p63.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxvii-p64"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxvii-p64.1">τὰ τῆς καινοτομὶας ἃπαντα
τῆς παρὰ φύσιν</span>. Perhaps the text is mutilated.</p></note>  So also Christ, implying the
same, said, “Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye
also so them;” showing that He is not introducing any thing
new.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvii-p65"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 11.16" id="iv.xxvii-p65.1" parsed="|1Cor|11|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.11.16">Ver. 16</scripRef>. “But if any man seems to
be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the Churches of
God.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvii-p66">It is then contentiousness to oppose these things,
and not any exercise of reason. Notwithstanding, even thus it is
a measured sort of rebuke which he adopts, to fill them the more
with self-reproach; which in truth rendered his saying the more
severe. “For we,” saith he, “have no such custom,” so as
to contend and to strive and to oppose ourselves. And he stopped
not even here, but also added, “neither the Churches of God;”
signifying that they resist and oppose themselves to the whole
world by not yielding. However, even if the Corinthians were then
contentious, yet now the whole world hath both received and kept
this law. So great is the power of the Crucified.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvii-p67">[6.] But I fear lest having assumed the dress, yet
in their deeds some of our women should be found immodest and in
other ways uncovered. For therefore also writing to Timothy Paul
was not content with these things, but added others, saying,
“that they adorn themselves in modest apparel, with
shamefacedness and sobriety; not with braided hair, or gold.”
(<scripRef passage="1 Tim. ii. 9" id="iv.xxvii-p67.1" parsed="|1Tim|2|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.2.9">1 Tim. ii. 9</scripRef>.) For if one ought not to
have the head bare, but everywhere to carry about the token of
authority, much more is it becoming to exhibit the same in our
deeds. Thus at any rate the former women also used both to call
their husbands lords, (<scripRef passage="1 Pet. iii. 6" id="iv.xxvii-p67.2" parsed="|1Pet|3|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Pet.3.6">1
Pet. iii. 6</scripRef>.) and to
yield the precedence to them. “Because they for their part,”
you say, “used to love their own wives.” I know that as well
as you: I am not ignorant of it. But when we are exhorting thee
concerning thine own duties, let not theirs take all thine
attention. For so, when we exhort children to be obedient to
parents, saying, that it is written, “honor thy father and thy
mother,” they reply to us, “mention also what follows, ‘and
ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath,’” (<scripRef passage="Eph. vi. 1-4" id="iv.xxvii-p67.3" parsed="|Eph|6|1|6|4" osisRef="Bible:Eph.6.1-Eph.6.4">Eph. vi. 1–4</scripRef>.) And servants when we tell
them that it is written that they should “obey their masters, and
not serve with eye-service,” they also again demand of us what
follows, bidding us also give the same advice to masters. For
Paul bade them also, they saw, “to forbear threatening.” But
let us not do thus nor enquire into the things enjoined on others,
when we are charged with regard to our own: for neither will thy
obtaining a partner in the charges free thee from the blame: but
look to one thing only, how thou mayest rid thyself of those
charges which lie against thyself. Since Adam also laid the blame
on the woman, and she again on the serpent, but this did in no wise
deliver them. Do not thou, therefore, for thy part, say this to
me now, but be careful with all consideration to render what thou
owest to thy husband: since also when I am discoursing with thy
husband, advising him to love and cherish thee, I suffer him not to
bring forward the law that is appointed for the woman, but I
require of him that which is written for himself. And do thou
therefore busy thyself with those things only which belong to thee,
and show thyself tractable to thy consort. And accordingly if it
be really for God’s sake that thou obeyest thy husband, tell me
not of the things which ought to be done by him, but for what
things thou hast been made responsible by the lawgiver, those
perform with exactness. For this is especially to obey God, not
to transgress the law <pb n="155" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_155.html" id="iv.xxvii-Page_155" />even when
suffering things contrary to it. And by the same rule, he that
being beloved loves, is not reckoned to do any great thing. But
he that waits upon a person who hateth him, this above all is the
man to receive a crown. In the same manner then do thou also
reckon that if thy husband give thee disgust, and thou endure it,
thou shalt receive a glorious crown: but if he be gentle and
mild, what will there be for God to reward in thee? And these
things I say, not bidding the husbands be harsh; but persuading the
wives to bear even with harshness in their husbands. Since when
each is careful to fulfil his own duty, his neighbor’s part also
will quickly follow: as when the wife is prepared to bear even
with rough behavior in the husband, and the husband refrains from
abusing her in her angry mood; then all is a calm and a harbor free
from waves.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvii-p68">[7.] So also was it with those of old time. Each
was employed in fulfilling his own duty, not in exacting that of
his neighbor. Thus, if you mark it, Abraham took his brother’s
son: his wife found no fault with him. He commanded her to
travel a long journey; she spake not even against this but
followed. Again, after those many miseries and labors and toils
having become lord of all, he yielded the precedency to Lot. And
so far from Sarah being offended at this, she did not even open her
mouth, nor uttered any such thing as many of the women of these
days utter, when they see their own husbands coming off inferior in
such allotments, and especially in dealing with inferiors;
reproaching them, and calling them fools and senseless and unmanly
and traitors and stupid. But no such thing did she say or think,
but was pleased with all things that were done by him.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvii-p69">And another thing, and that a greater: after that
Lot had the choice put in his power, and had thrown the inferior
part upon his uncle, a great danger fell upon him.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvii-p70">Whereof the patriarch hearing, armed all his people,
and set himself against the whole army of the Persians with his own
domestics only, and not even then did she detain him, nor say, as
was likely, “O man, whither goest thou, thrusting thyself down
precipices, and exposing thyself to so great hazards; for one who
wronged thee and seized on all that was thine, shedding thy
blood? Yea, and even if thou make light of thyself, yet have pity
on me which have left house and country and friends and kindred,
and have followed thee in so long a pilgrimage; and involve me not
in widowhood, and in the miseries of widowhood.” None of these
things she said: she thought not of them but bore all in
silence.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvii-p71">After this, her womb continuing barren, she herself
suffers not the grief of women nor laments: but he complains,
though not to his wife, but to God. And see how each preserves
his own appropriate part: for he neither despised Sarah as
childless, nor reproached her with any such thing: and she again
was anxious to devise some consolation to him for her childlessness
by means of the handmaid. For these things had not yet been
forbidden then as now. For now neither is it lawful for women to
indulge their husbands in such things, nor for the men, with or
without the wife’s knowledge, to form such connexions, even
though the grief of their childlessness should infinitely harass
them: since they also shall hear the sentence, “their worm
shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched.” For now
it is not permitted, but then it had not been forbidden.
Wherefore both his wife commanded this, and he obeyed, yet not even
thus for pleasure’s sake. But “behold,” it will be said,
“how he cast Hagar out again at her bidding.” Well, this is
what I want to point out, that both he obeyed her in all things,
and she him. But do not thou give heed to these things only, but
examine, thou who urgest this plea, into what had gone before also,
Hagar’s insulting her, her boasting herself against her mistress;
than which what can be more vexatious to a free and honorable
woman?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvii-p72">[8.] Let not then the wife tarry for the virtue of
the husband and then show her own, for this is nothing great; nor,
on the other hand, the husband, for the obedience of the wife and
then exercise self-command; for neither would this any more be his
own well-doing; but let each, as I said, furnish his own share
first. For if to the Gentiles smiting us on the right, we must
turn the other cheek; much more ought one to bear with harsh
behavior in a husband.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvii-p73">And I say not this for a wife to be beaten; far from
it: for this is the extremest affront, not to her that is beaten,
but to him who beateth. But even if by some misfortune thou have
such a yokefellow allotted thee, take it not ill, O woman,
considering the reward which is laid up for such things and their
praise too in this present life. And to you husbands also this I
say: make it a rule that there can be no such offence as to bring
you under the necessity of striking a wife. And why say I a wife?
since not even upon his handmaiden could a free man endure to
inflict blows and lay violent hands. But if the shame be great
for a man to beat a maidservant, much more to stretch forth the
right hand against her that is free. And this one might see even
from heathen legislatures who no longer compel her that hath been
so treated to live with him that beat her, as being unworthy of her
fellowship. For surely it comes of extreme lawlessness when thy
partner <pb n="156" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_156.html" id="iv.xxvii-Page_156" />of life, she who in the
most intimate relations and in the highest degree, is united with
thee; when she, like a base slave, is dishonored by thee.
Wherefore also such a man, if indeed one must call him a man and
not rather a wild beast, I should say, was like a parricide and a
murderer of his mother. For if for a wife’s sake we were
commanded to leave even father and mother, not wronging them but
fulfilling a divine law; and a law so grateful to our parents
themselves that even they, the very persons whom we are leaving,
are thankful, and bring it about with great eagerness; what but
extreme frenzy can it be to insult her for whose sake God bade us
leave even our parents?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvii-p74">But we may well ask, Is it only madness? There is
the shame too: I would fain know who can endure it. And what
description can set it before us; when shrieks and wailings are
borne along the alleys, and there is a running to the house of him
that is so disgracing himself, both of the neighbors and the
passers by, as though some wild beast were ravaging within? 
Better were it that the earth should gape asunder for one so
frantic, than that he should be seen at all in the forum after
it.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvii-p75">“But the woman is insolent,” saith he.
Consider nevertheless that she is a woman, the weaker vessel,
whereas thou art a man. For therefore wert thou ordained<note place="end" n="141" id="iv.xxvii-p75.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxvii-p76"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxvii-p76.1">ἓ</span><span class="Greek" id="iv.xxvii-p76.2">χειροτονήθης</span>.</p></note> to be ruler;
and wert assigned to her in place of a head, that thou mightest
bear with the weakness of her that is set under thee. Make then
thy rule glorious. And glorious it will be when the subject of it
meets with no dishonor from thee. And as the monarch will appear
so much the more dignified, as he manifests more dignity in the
officer under him; but if he dishonor and depreciate the greatness
of that rank, he is indirectly cutting off no small portion of his
own glory likewise: so also thou dishonor her who governs next to
thyself, wilt in no common degree mar the honor of thy
governance.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvii-p77">Considering therefore all these things, command
thyself: and withal think also of that evening on which the
father having called thee, delivered thee his daughter as a kind of
deposit, and having separated her from all, from her mother, from
himself, from the family, intrusted her entire guardianship to thy
right hand. Consider that (under God) through her thou hast
children and hast become a father, and be thou also on that account
gentle towards her.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvii-p78">Seest thou not the husbandmen, how the earth which
hath once received the seed, they tend with all various methods of
culture, though it have ten thousand disadvantages; e.g., though it
be an unkindly soil or bear ill weeds, or though it be vexed with
excessive rain through the nature of its situation? This also do
thou. For thus shalt thou be first to enjoy both the fruit and
the calm. Since thy wife is to thee both a harbor, and a potent
healing charm to rejoice thy heart. Well then: if thou shalt
free thy harbor from winds and waves, thou shalt enjoy much
tranquility on thy return from the market-place: but if thou fill
it with clamor and tumult, thou dost but prepare for thyself a more
grievous shipwreck.  In order then to prevent this, let what I
advise be done: When any thing uncomfortable happens in the
household, if she be in the wrong console her and do not aggravate
the discomfort. For even if thou shouldest lose all, nothing is
more grievous than to have a wife without good-will sharing thine
abode. And whatever offence thou canst mention, thou wilt tell me
of nothing so very painful as being at strife with her. So that
if it were only for such reasons as these, let her love be more
precious than all things. For if one another’s burdens are to
be borne, much more our own wife’s.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvii-p79">Though she be poor do not upbraid her: 
though she be foolish, do not trample on her, but train her
rather: because she is a member of thee, and ye are become one
flesh.  “But she is trifling and drunken and passionate.”
Thou oughtest then to grieve over these things, not to be angry;
and to beseech God, and exhort her and give her advice, and do
every thing to remove the evil. But if thou strike her thou dost
aggravate the disease: for fierceness is removed by moderation,
not by rival fierceness. With these things bear in mind also the
reward from God: that when it is permitted thee to cut her off,
and thou doest not so for the fear of God, but bearest with so
great defects, fearing the law appointed in such matters which
forbids to put away a wife whatsoever disease she may have: thou
shalt receive an unspeakable reward. Yea, and before the reward
thou shalt be a very great gainer, both rendering her more obedient
and becoming thyself more gentle thereby. It is said, for
instance, that one of the heathen philosophers<note place="end" n="142" id="iv.xxvii-p79.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxvii-p80"> Socrates.</p></note>, who had a bad wife, a trifler and
a brawler, when asked, “Why, having such an one, he endured
her;” made reply, “That he might have in his house a school and
training-place of philosophy. For I shall be to all the rest
meeker,” saith he, “being here disciplined every day.” Did
you utter a great shout? Why, I at this moment am greatly
mourning, when heathens prove better lovers of wisdom than we; we
who are commanded to imitate angels, nay rather who are commanded
to follow God Himself in respect of gentleness.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxvii-p81">But to proceed: it is said that for this reason
the philosopher having a bad wife, cast her not 
<pb n="157" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_157.html" id="iv.xxvii-Page_157" />out; and some say that this very thing was the
reason of his marrying her. But I, because many men have
dispositions not exactly reasonable, advise that at first they do
all they can, and be careful that they take a suitable partner and
one full of all virtue. Should it happen, however, that they miss
their end, and she whom they have brought into the house prove no
good or tolerable bride, then I would have them at any rate try to
be like this philosopher, and train her in every way, and consider
nothing more important than this. Since neither will a merchant,
until he have made a compact with his partner capable of procuring
peace, launch the vessel into the deep, nor apply himself to the
rest of the transaction. And let us then use every effort that
she who is partner with us in the business of life and in this our
vessel, may be kept in all peace within. For thus shall our other
affairs too be all in calm, and with tranquility shall we run our
course through the ocean of the present life. Compared with this,
let house, and slaves, and money, and lands, and the business
itself of the state, be less in our account. And let it be more
valuable than all in our eyes that she who with us sits at the oars
should not be in mutiny and disunion with us. For so shall our
other matters proceed with a favoring tide, and in spiritual things
also we shall find ourselves much the freer from hindrance, drawing
this yoke with one accord; and having done all things well, we
shall obtain the blessings laid up in store; unto which may we all
attain, through the grace and mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ, with
Whom to the Father, with the Holy Ghost, be glory, power, and
honor, now and ever, and world without end. Amen.</p>

considering the present charge to state also first the occasion of
it. For thus again will our discourse be more intelligible.
What then is this occasion?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxviii-p5">As in the case of the three thousand who
believed in the beginning, all had eaten their meals in common and
had all things common; such also was the practice at the time when
the Apostle wrote this: not such indeed exactly; but as it were a
certain outflowing of that communion which abode among them
descended also to them that came after. And because of course
some were poor, but others rich, they laid not down all their goods
in the midst, but made the tables open on stated days, as it should
seem; and when the solemn service<note place="end" n="143" id="iv.xxviii-p5.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxviii-p6"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxviii-p6.1">τῆς συνάξεως</span>.</p></note> was completed, after the communion
of the Mysteries, they all went to a common entertainment, the rich
bringing their provisions with them, and the poor and destitute
being invited by them, and all feasting in common. But afterward
this custom also became corrupt. And the reason was, their being
divided and addicting themselves, some to this party, and others to
that, and saying, “I am of such a one,” and “I of such a
one;” which thing also to correct he said in the beginning of the
Epistle, “For it hath been signified unto me concerning you, my
brethren, by them which are of the household of Chloe, that there
are contentions among you. Now this I mean, that each one of you
saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas.” Not
that Paul was the person to whom they were attaching themselves;
for he would not have borne it: but wishing by concession to tear
up this custom from the root, he introduced himself, indicating
that if any one had inscribed upon himself even his name when
breaking off from the common body, even so the thing done was
profane and extreme wickedness. And if in his case it were
wickedness, much more in the case of those who were inferior to
him.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxviii-p7">[2.] Since therefore this custom was broken
through, a custom most excellent and most useful; (for it was a
foundation of love, and a comfort to poverty, and a corrective of
riches, and an occasion of the highest philosophy, and an
instruction of humility:)  since however he saw so great
advantages in a way to be destroyed, he naturally addresses them
with severity, thus saying: “But in giving you this charge, I
praise you not.” For in the former charge, as there were many
who kept (the ordinances), he began otherwise, saying thus: 
“Now I praise you that ye remember me in all things:” but
here contrariwise, “But in giving you this charge, I praise you
not.” And here is the reason why 
<pb n="158" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_158.html" id="iv.xxviii-Page_158" />he placed it not after the rebuke of them that
eat the idol-sacrifices. But because that was unusually harsh he
interposes the discourse about wearing of long hair, that he might
not have to pass from one set of vehement reproofs to others again
of an invidious kind and so appear too harsh: and then he returns
to the more vehement tone, and says, “But in giving you this
charge, I praise you not.”  What is this? That which I am
about to tell you of. What is, “giving you this charge, I
praise you not?” “I do not approve you,” saith he,
“because ye have reduced me to the necessity of giving advice: 
I do not praise you, because ye have required instruction in regard
to this, because ye have need of an admonition from me.” Dost
thou perceive how from his beginning he signifieth that what was
done was very profane? For when he that errs ought not to require
so much as a hint to prevent his erring, the error would seem to be
unpardonable.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxviii-p8">And why dost thou not praise? Because “ye
come together,” saith he, “not for the better but for the
worse;” i.e., because ye do not go forward unto virtue. For it
were meet that your liberality<note place="end" n="144" id="iv.xxviii-p8.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxviii-p9"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxviii-p9.1">φιλοτιμίαν</span>.</p></note> should increase and become
manifold, but ye have taken rather from the custom which already
prevailed, and have so taken from it as even to need warning from
me, in order that ye may return to the former order.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxviii-p10">Further, that he might not seem to say these things
on account of the poor only, he doth not at once strike in to the
discourse concerning the tables, lest he render his rebuke such as
they might easily come to think slightly of, but he searches for an
expression most confounding and very fearful. For what saith
he?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxviii-p11"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 11.18" id="iv.xxviii-p11.1" parsed="|1Cor|11|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.11.18">Ver. 18</scripRef>. “For first of all,
when ye come together in the Church, I hear that divisions<note place="end" n="145" id="iv.xxviii-p11.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxviii-p12"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxviii-p12.1">σχίσματα</span>.</p></note> exist among
you.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxviii-p13">And he saith not, “For fear that you do not sup
together in common;” “for I hear that you feast in private, and
not with the poor:” but what was most calculated thoroughly to
shake their minds, that he set down, the name of division, which
was the cause of this mischief also: and so he reminded them
again of that which was said in the beginning of the Epistle, and
was “signified by them of the house of Chloe.” (c. <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 1.11" id="iv.xxviii-p13.1" parsed="|1Cor|1|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.1.11">i. 11</scripRef>.) “And I partly believe
it.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxviii-p14">Thus, lest they should say, “But what if the
accusers speak falsely?” he neither saith, “I believe it,”
lest he should rather make them reckless; nor again, on the other
hand, “I disbelieve it,” lest he should seem to reprove without
cause, but, “I partly believe it,” saith he, i.e., “I believe
it in a small part;” making them anxious and inviting them to
return to correction.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxviii-p15">[3.] <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 11.19" id="iv.xxviii-p15.1" parsed="|1Cor|11|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.11.19">Ver. 19</scripRef>. “For there must be also
factions among you, that they which are approved may be made
manifest among you.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxviii-p16">By “factions,” here he means those which concern
not the doctrines, but these present divisions. But even if he
had spoken of the doctrinal heresies, not even thus did he give
them any handle. For Christ Himself said, “it must needs be
that occasions of stumbling come,” (<scripRef passage="Matt. xviii. 7" id="iv.xxviii-p16.1" parsed="|Matt|18|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.18.7">Matt. xviii. 7</scripRef>.) not destroying the
liberty of the will nor appointing any necessity and compulsion
over man’s life, but foretelling what would certainly ensue from
the evil mind of men; which would take place, not because of his
prediction, but because the incurably disposed are so minded. For
not because he foretold them did these things happen: but because
they were certainly about to happen, therefore he foretold them.
Since, if the occasions of stumbling were of necessity and not of
the mind of them that bring them in, it was superfluous His saying,
“Woe to that man by whom the occasion cometh.” But these
things we discussed more at length when we were upon the passage
itself<note place="end" n="146" id="iv.xxviii-p16.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxviii-p17"> vid. S. Chrys. on S. Matth. Hom. 59.</p></note>; now we must
proceed to what is before us.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxviii-p18">Now that he said these things of these factions
relating to the tables, and that contention and division, he made
manifest also from what follows. For having said, “I hear that
there are divisions among you,” he stopped not here, but
signifying what divisions he means he goes on to say, “each one
taketh before other his own supper;” and again, “What? have ye
not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the Church of
God?” However, that of these he was speaking is evident. And
if he call them divisions, marvel not. For, as I said, he wishes
to touch them by the expression: whereas had they been divisions
of doctrine, he would not have discoursed with them thus mildly.
Hear him, for instance, when he speaks of any such thing, how
vehement he is both in assertion and in reproof: in assertion, as
when he says, “If even an angel preach any other gospel unto you
than that ye have received, let him be accursed;” (<scripRef passage="Gal. i. 8" id="iv.xxviii-p18.1" parsed="|Gal|1|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gal.1.8">Gal. i. 8</scripRef>.) but in reproof, as when he
says, “Whosoever of you would be justified by the law, ye are
fallen away from grace.” (<scripRef passage="Gal. v. 4" id="iv.xxviii-p18.2" parsed="|Gal|5|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gal.5.4">Gal. v. 4</scripRef>.) And at one time he calls
the corrupters “dogs,” saying, “Beware of dogs:” (<scripRef passage="Philip. iii. 2" id="iv.xxviii-p18.3" parsed="|Phil|3|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Phil.3.2">Philip. iii. 2</scripRef>.) at another, “having their
consciences seared with a hot iron.” (<scripRef passage="1 Tim. iv. 2" id="iv.xxviii-p18.4" parsed="|1Tim|4|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.4.2">1 Tim. iv. 2</scripRef>.) And again, “angels of
Satan:” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. xi. 14-15" id="iv.xxviii-p18.5" parsed="|2Cor|11|14|11|15" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.11.14-2Cor.11.15">2 Cor. xi.
14–15</scripRef>.) but here he
said no such thing, but spoke in a gentle and subdued tone.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxviii-p19"><pb n="159" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_159.html" id="iv.xxviii-Page_159" />But what
is, “that they which are approved may be made manifest among
you?” That they may shine the more. And what he intends to
say is this, that those who are unchangeable and firm are so far
from being at all injured hereby, but even shows them the more, and
that it makes them more glorious. For the word, “that<note place="end" n="147" id="iv.xxviii-p19.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxviii-p20"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxviii-p20.1">ἵ</span><span class="Greek" id="iv.xxviii-p20.2">να</span>.</p></note>,” is not
every where indicative of cause, but frequently also of the event
of things. Thus Christ Himself uses it, when He saith, “For
judgement I am come into this world; that they which see not may
see, and that they which see may be made blind.” (<scripRef passage="John ix. 39" id="iv.xxviii-p20.3" parsed="|John|9|39|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.9.39">John ix. 39</scripRef>.) So likewise Paul in
another place, when discoursing of the law, he writes, “And the
Law came in beside, that the trespass might abound.” (<scripRef passage="Rom. v. 20" id="iv.xxviii-p20.4" parsed="|Rom|5|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.5.20">Rom. v. 20</scripRef>.) But neither was the
law given to this end that the trespasses of the Jews might be
increased: (though this did ensue:)  nor did Christ come for
this end that they which see might be made blind, but for the
contrary; but the result was such. Thus then also here must one
understand the expression, “that they which are approved may be
made manifest.” For not at all with this view came heresies
into being, that “they which are approved may be made
manifest,” but on these heresies taking place such was the
result. Now these things he said to console the poor, those of
them who nobly bore that sort of contempt. Wherefore he said not,
“that they may become approved,” but, “that they which are
approved may be made manifest; showing that before this also they
were such, but they were mixed up with the multitude, and while
enjoying such relief as was afforded them by the rich, they were
not very conspicuous: but now this strife and contentiousness
made them manifest, even as the storm shows the pilot. And he
said not, “that ye may appear approved,” but, “that they
which are approved may be made manifest, those among you who are
such.” For neither when he is accusing doth he lay them open,
that he may not render them more reckless; nor when praising, that
he may not make them more boastful; but he leaves both this
expression and that in suspense<note place="end" n="148" id="iv.xxviii-p20.5"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxviii-p21"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxviii-p21.1">εἰς μετέωρον ἀφίησι</span>,
“sends it out into the air.”</p></note>, allowing each man’s own
conscience to make the application of what he saith.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxviii-p22">Nor doth he here seem to me to be comforting the
poor only, but those also who were not violating the custom. For
it was likely that there were among them also those that observed
it.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxviii-p23">And this is why he said, “I partly believe
it.” Justly then doth he call these “approved,” who not
only with the rest observed the custom, but even without them kept
this good law undisturbed. And he doth this, studying by such
praises to render both others and these persons themselves more
forward.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxviii-p24">[4.] Then at last he adds the very form of
offence. And what is it?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxviii-p25"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 11.20" id="iv.xxviii-p25.1" parsed="|1Cor|11|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.11.20">Ver. 20</scripRef>. “When ye assemble
yourselves together,” saith he, “it is not possible to eat the
Lord’s Supper.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxviii-p26">Seest thou how effectually appealing to their shame,
even already by way of narrative he contrives to give them his
counsel? “For the appearance of your assembly,” saith he,
“is different. It is one of love and brotherly affection. At
least one place receives you all, and ye are together in one
flock. But the Banquet, when you come to that, bears no
resemblance to the Assembly of worshippers.” And he said not,
“When ye come together, this is not to eat in common; “this is
not to feast with one another;” but otherwise again and much more
fearfully he reprimands them, saying, “it is not possible to eat
the Lord’s Supper,” sending them away now from this point to
that evening on which Christ delivered the awful Mysteries.
Therefore also he called the early meal “a supper.” For that
supper too had them all reclining at meat together: yet surely
not so great was the distance between the rich and the poor as
between the Teacher and the disciples. For that is infinite.
And why say I the Teacher and the disciples? Think of the
interval between the Teacher and the traitor: nevertheless, the
Lord Himself both sat at meat with them and did not even cast him
out, but both gave him his portion of salt and made him partaker of
the Mysteries.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxviii-p27">Next he explains how “it is not possible to eat
the Lord’s Supper.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxviii-p28"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 11.21" id="iv.xxviii-p28.1" parsed="|1Cor|11|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.11.21">Ver. 21</scripRef>. “For in your
eating,<note place="end" n="149" id="iv.xxviii-p28.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxviii-p29"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxviii-p29.1">ἐν τῷ
φαγεῖν</span>.</p></note> each one
taketh before other his own supper,” saith he, “and one is
hungry, and another is drunken.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxviii-p30">Perceivest thou how he intimates that they were
disgracing themselves rather? For that which is the Lord’s,
they make a private matter: so that themselves are the first to
suffer indignity, depriving their own table of its greatest
prerogative. How and in what manner? Because the Lord’s
Supper, i.e. the Master’s, ought to be common. For the property
of the master belongs not to this servant without belonging to
that, but in common to all. So that by “the Lord’s” Supper
he expresses this, the “community” of the feast. As if he had
said, “If it be thy master’s, as assuredly it is, thou oughtest
not to withdraw it as private, but as belonging to thy Lord and
Master to set it in common before all. For this is the meaning
of, ‘the Lord’s.’ But now thou dost not suffer it to be the
Lord’s, not suffering it to be 
<pb n="160" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_160.html" id="iv.xxviii-Page_160" />common but feasting by thyself.” Wherefore
also he goes on to say,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxviii-p31">“For each one taketh before other his own
supper.” And he said not, “cutteth off,” but “taketh
before,” tacitly censuring them both for greediness and for
precipitancy. This at least the sequel also shows. For having
said this, he added again, “and one is hungry, and another is
drunken,” each of which showed a want of moderation, both the
craving and the excess. See also a second fault again whereby
those same persons are injured: the first, that they dishonor
their supper: the second, that they are greedy and drunken; and
what is yet worse, even when the poor are hungry. For what was
intended to be set before all in common, that these men fed on
alone, and proceeded both to surfeiting and to drunkenness.
Wherefore neither did he say, “one is hungry, and another is
filled:” but, “is drunken.” Now each of these, even by
itself, is worthy of censure: for it is a fault to be drunken
even without despising the poor; and to despise the poor without
being drunken, is an accusation. When both then are joined
together at the same time, consider how exceeding great is the
transgression.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxviii-p32">Next, having pointed out their profaneness, he adds
his reprimand in what follows, with much anger, saying,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxviii-p33"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 11.22" id="iv.xxviii-p33.1" parsed="|1Cor|11|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.11.22">Ver. 22</scripRef>. “What? have ye not houses
to eat and to drink in? Or despise ye the Church of God, and put
them to shame that have not?”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxviii-p34">Seest thou how he transferred the charge from the
indignity offered to the poor to the Church, that his words might
make a deeper impression of disgust? Here now you see is yet a
fourth accusation, when not the poor only, but the Church likewise
is insulted. For even as thou makest the Lord’s Supper a
private meal, so also the place again, using the Church as a
house. For it was made a Church, not that we who come together
might be divided, but that they who are divided might be joined: 
and this act of assembling shows.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxviii-p35">“And put them to shame that have not.” He said
not, “and kill with hunger them that have not,” but so as much
more to put them to the blush, “shame them;” to point out that
it is not food which he cares for so much as the wrong done unto
them. Behold again a fifth accusation, not only to overlook the
poor but even to shame them. Now this he said, partly as treating
with reverence the concerns of the poor, and intimating that they
grieve not so for the belly as for the shame; and partly also
drawing the hearer to compassion.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxviii-p36">Having therefore pointed out so great
impieties, indignity to the Supper, indignity to the Church, the
contempt practised towards the poor; he relaxes again the tones of
his reproof, saying, all of a sudden<note place="end" n="150" id="iv.xxviii-p36.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxviii-p37"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxviii-p37.1">χαλᾶ τὸν τόνον, ἀθρόον
λέγων</span>.</p></note>, “Shall I praise you? In this I
praise you not.” Wherein one might especially marvel at him
that when there was need to strike and chide more vehemently after
the proof of so great offences, he doeth the contrary rather, gives
way, and permits them to recover breath. What then may the cause
be? He had touched more painfully than usual in aggravating the
charge, and being a most excellent physician, he adapts the
incision to the wounds, neither cutting superficially those parts
which require a deep stroke; (for thou hast heard him how he cut
off among those very persons him that had committed fornication;)
nor delivering over to the knife those things which require the
milder sort of remedies. For this cause then here also he
conducts his address more mildly, and in another point of view
likewise, he sought especially to render them gentle to the poor: 
and this is why he discourses with them rather in a subdued
tone.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxviii-p38">[5.] Next, wishing also from another topic to
shame them yet more, he takes again the points which were most
essential and of them weaves his discourse.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxviii-p39"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 11.23" id="iv.xxviii-p39.1" parsed="|1Cor|11|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.11.23">Ver. 23</scripRef>. “For I received of the
Lord,” saith he, “that which also I delivered unto you: how
that the Lord Jesus in the night in which He was betrayed, took
bread:”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxviii-p40"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 11.24" id="iv.xxviii-p40.1" parsed="|1Cor|11|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.11.24">Ver. 24</scripRef>. “And when He had given
thanks, He brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is My Body, which
is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxviii-p41">Wherefore doth he here make mention of the
Mysteries? Because that argument was very necessary to his
present purpose. As thus: “Thy Master,” saith he,
“counted all worthy of the same Table, though it be very awful
and far exceeding the dignity of all: but thou considerest them
to be unworthy even of thine own, small and mean as we see it is;
and while they have no advantage over thee in spiritual things,
thou robbest them in the temporal things. For neither are these
thine own.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxviii-p42">However, he doth not express himself thus, to
prevent his discourse becoming harsh:  but he frames it in a
gentler form, saying, that “the Lord Jesus in the night in which
He was betrayed, took bread.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxviii-p43">And wherefore doth he remind us of the time, and of
that evening, and of the betrayal? Not indifferently nor without
some reason, but that he might exceedingly fill them with
compunction, were it but from consideration of the time. For even
if one be a very stone, yet when he considers that night, how He
was with His disciples, “very heavy,” how He was betrayed, how
He was bound, how He was led away, how He was judged, how He
suffered all <pb n="161" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_161.html" id="iv.xxviii-Page_161" />the rest in order,
he becometh softer than wax, and is withdrawn from earth and all
the pomp of this world. Therefore he leads us to the remembrance
of all those things, by His time, and His table, and His betrayal,
putting us to shame and saying, “Thy Master gave up even Himself
for thee: and thou dost not even share a little meat with thy
brother for thine own sake.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxviii-p44">But how saith he, that “he received it from the
Lord?” since certainly he was not present then but was one of the
persecutors. That thou mayest know that the first table had no
advantage above that which cometh after it. For even to-day also
it is He who doeth all, and delivereth it even as then.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxviii-p45">And not on this account only doth he remind us
of that night, but that he may also in another way bring us to
compunction. For as we particularly remember those words which we
hear last from those who are departing; and to their heirs if they
should venture to transgress their commands, when we would put them
to shame we say, “Consider that this was the last word that your
father uttered to you, and until the evening when he was just about
to breathe his last he kept repeating these injunctions:” just
so Paul, purposing hence also to make his argument full of
awfulness; “Remember,” saith he, “that this was the last
mysterious rite<note place="end" n="151" id="iv.xxviii-p45.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxviii-p46"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxviii-p46.1">μυσταγωγίαν</span>.</p></note> He gave unto
you, and in that night on which He was about to be slain for us, He
commanded these things, and having delivered to us that Supper
after that He added nothing further.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxviii-p47">Next also he proceeds to recount the very
things that were done, saying, “He took bread, and, when He had
given thanks, He brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is My Body,
which is broken for you.” If therefore thou comest for a
sacrifice of thanksgiving,<note place="end" n="152" id="iv.xxviii-p47.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxviii-p48"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxviii-p48.1">εὐχαριστία</span>.</p></note> do thou on thy part nothing
unworthy of that sacrifice: by no means either dishonor thy
brother, or neglect him in his hunger; be not drunken, insult not
the Church. As thou comest giving thanks for what thou hast
enjoyed: so do thou thyself accordingly make return, and not cut
thyself off from thy neighbor. Since Christ for His part gave
equally to all, saying, “Take, eat.” He gave His Body
equally, but dost not thou give so much as the common bread
equally? Yea, it was indeed broken for all alike, and became the
Body equally for all.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxviii-p49"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 11.25" id="iv.xxviii-p49.1" parsed="|1Cor|11|25|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.11.25">Ver. 25</scripRef>. “In like manner also the
cup after supper, saying, This cup is the New Covenant in My
Blood: this do, as oft as ye drink of it, in remembrance of
Me.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxviii-p50">What sayest thou? Art thou making a remembrance of
Christ, and despisest thou the poor and tremblest not? Why, if a
son or brother had died and thou wert making a remembrance of him,
thou wouldst have been smitten by thy conscience, hadst thou not
fulfilled the custom and invited the poor: and when thou art
making remembrance of thy Master, dost thou not so much as simply
give a portion of the Table?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxviii-p51">But what is it which He saith, “This cup is the
New Covenant?” Because there was also a cup of the Old
Covenant; the libations and the blood of the brute creatures. For
after sacrificing, they used to receive the blood in a chalice and
bowl and so pour it out. Since then instead of the blood of
beasts He brought in His own Blood; lest any should be troubled on
hearing this, He reminds them of that ancient sacrifice.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxviii-p52">[6.] Next, having spoken concerning that Supper,
he connects the things present with the things of that time, that
even as on that very evening and reclining on that very couch and
receiving from Christ himself this sacrifice, so also now might men
be affected; and he saith,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxviii-p53"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 11.26" id="iv.xxviii-p53.1" parsed="|1Cor|11|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.11.26">Ver. 26</scripRef>. “For as often as ye eat
this bread, and drink this cup, ye proclaim the Lord’s death till
He come.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxviii-p54">For as Christ in regard to the bread and the cup
said, “Do this in remembrance of Me,” revealing to us the cause
of the giving of the Mystery, and besides what else He said,
declaring this to be a sufficient cause to ground our religious
fear upon:—(for when thou considerest what thy Master hath
suffered for thee, thou wilt the better deny thyself:)—so also
Paul saith here: “as often as ye eat ye do proclaim His
death.” And this is that Supper. Then intimating that it
abides unto the end, he saith, “till He come.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxviii-p55"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 11.27" id="iv.xxviii-p55.1" parsed="|1Cor|11|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.11.27">Ver. 27</scripRef>. “Wherefore whosoever
shall eat this bread and drink the cup of the Lord unworthily,
shall be guilty of the Body and the Blood of the Lord.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxviii-p56">Why so? Because he poured it out, and makes
the thing appear a slaughter and no longer a sacrifice. Much
therefore as they who then pierced Him, pierced Him not that they
might drink but that they might shed His blood: so likewise doth
he that cometh for it unworthily and reaps no profit thereby.
Seest thou how fearful he makes his discourse, and inveighs against
them very exceedingly, signifying that if they are thus to drink,
they partake unworthily of the elements<note place="end" n="153" id="iv.xxviii-p56.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxviii-p57"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxviii-p57.1">τῶν προκέιμενων</span>.</p></note>? For how can it be other than
unworthily when it is he who neglects the hungry? who besides
overlooking him puts him to shame? Since if not giving to the
poor casteth one out of the kingdom, even though one should be a
virgin; or rather, not giving 
<pb n="162" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_162.html" id="iv.xxviii-Page_162" />liberally: (for even those virgins too had oil,
only they had it not abundantly:)  consider how great the evil
will prove, to have wrought so many impieties?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxviii-p58">“What impieties?” say you. Why sayest
thou, what impieties? Thou hast partaken of such a Table and when
thou oughtest to be more gentle than any and like the angels, none
so cruel as thou art become. Thou hast tasted the Blood of the
Lord, and not even thereupon dost thou acknowledge thy brother.
Of what indulgence then art thou worthy? Whereas if even before
this thou hadst not known him, thou oughtest to have come to the
knowledge of him from the Table; but now thou dishonorest the Table
itself; he having been deemed worthy to partake of it and thou not
judging him worthy of thy meat. Hast thou not heard how much he
suffered who demanded the hundred pence? how he made void the gift
vouchsafed to him<note place="end" n="154" id="iv.xxviii-p58.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxviii-p59"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxviii-p59.1">ἐ</span><span class="Greek" id="iv.xxviii-p59.2">ξενεχθεῖσαν</span>, perhaps “officially
declared.”</p></note>? Doth it
not come into thy mind what thou wert and what thou hast become? 
Dost thou not put thyself in remembrance that if this man be poor
in possessions, thou wast much more beggarly in good works, being
full of ten thousand sins? Notwithstanding, God delivered thee
from all those and counted thee worthy of such a Table: but thou
art not even thus become more merciful: therefore of course
nothing else remaineth but that thou shouldest be “delivered to
the tormentors.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxviii-p60">[7.] These words let us also listen to, all of us,
as many as in this place approach with the poor to this holy Table,
but when we go out, do not seem even to have seen them, but are
both drunken and pass heedlessly by the hungry; the very things
whereof the Corinthians were accused. And when is this done? say
you. At all times indeed, but especially at the festivals, where
above all times it ought not so to be. Is it not so, that at such
times, immediately after Communion, drunkenness succeeds and
contempt of the poor? And having partaken of the Blood, when it
were a time for thee to fast and watch, thou givest thyself up to
wine and revelling. And yet if thou hast by chance made thy
morning meal on any thing good, thou keepest thyself lest by any
other unsavory viand thou spoil the taste of the former: and now
that thou hast been feasting on the Spirit thou bringest in a
satanical luxury. Consider, when the Apostles partook of that
holy Supper, what they did: did they not betake themselves to
prayers and singing of hymns? to sacred vigils? to that long work
of teaching, so full of all self-denial? For then He related and
delivered to them those great and wonderful things, when Judas had
gone out to call them who were about to crucify Him. Hast thou
not heard how the three thousand also who partook of the Communion
continued even in prayer and teaching, not in drunken feasts and
revellings? But thou before thou hast partaken fastest, that in a
certain way thou mayest appear worthy of the Communion: but when
thou hast partaken, and thou oughtest to increase thy temperance,
thou undoest all. And yet surely it is not the same to fast
before this and after it. Since although it is our duty to be
temperate at both times, yet most particularly after we have
received the Bridegroom.  Before, that thou mayest become worthy
of receiving: after, that thou mayest not be found unworthy of
what thou hast received.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxviii-p61">“What then? ought we to fast after
receiving?” I say not this, neither do I use any compulsion.
This indeed were well: however, I do not enforce this, but I
exhort you not to feast to excess. For if one never ought to live
luxuriously, and Paul showed this when he said, “she that giveth
herself to pleasure is dead while she liveth” (<scripRef passage="1 Tim. v. 6" id="iv.xxviii-p61.1" parsed="|1Tim|5|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.5.6">1 Tim. v. 6</scripRef>.); much more will she then be
dead. And if luxury be death to a woman, much more to a man: 
and if this done at another time is fatal, much more after the
communion of the Mysteries. And dost thou having taken the bread
of life, do an action of death and not shudder? Knowest thou not
how great evils are brought in by luxury? Unseasonable laughter,
disorderly expressions, buffoonery fraught with perdition,
unprofitable trifling, all the other things, which it is not seemly
even to name. And these things thou doest when thou hast enjoyed
the Table of Christ, on that day on which thou hast been counted
worthy to touch His flesh with thy tongue. What then is to be
done to prevent these things? Purify thy right hand, thy tongue,
thy lips, which have become a threshold for Christ to tread upon.
Consider the time in which thou didst draw near and set forth a
material table, raise thy mind to that Table, to the Supper of the
Lord, to the vigil of the disciples, in that night, that holy
night. Nay, rather should one accurately examine, this very
present state is night. Let us watch then with the Lord, let us
be pricked in our hearts with the disciples. It is the season of
prayers, not of drunkenness; ever indeed, but especially during a
festival. For a festival is therefore appointed, not that we may
behave ourselves unseemly, not that we may accumulate sins, but
rather that we may blot out those which exist.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxviii-p62">I know, indeed, that I say these things in vain, yet
will I not cease to say them. For if ye do not all obey, yet
surely ye will not all disobey; or rather, even though ye should
all be disobedient, my reward will be greater, though <pb n="163" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_163.html" id="iv.xxviii-Page_163" />yours will be more condemnation.
However, that it may not be more, to this end I will not cease to
speak. For perchance, perchance, by my perseverance I shall be
able to reach you.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxviii-p63">Wherefore I beseech you that we do not this to
condemnation; let us nourish Christ, let us give Him drink, let us
clothe Him. These things are worthy of that Table. Hast thou
heard holy hymns? Hast thou seen a spiritual marriage? Hast
thou enjoyed a royal Table? Hast thou been filled with the Holy
Ghost? Hast thou joined in the choir of the Seraphim? Hast thou
become partaker of the powers above? Cast not away so great a
joy, waste not the treasure, bring not in drunkenness, the mother
of dejection, the joy of the devil, the parent of ten thousand
evils. For hence is a sleep like unto death, and heaviness of
head, and disease, and obliviousness, and an image of dead men’s
condition. Further, if thou wouldst not choose to meet with a
friend when intoxicated, when thou hast Christ within, durst thou,
tell me, to thrust in upon Him so great an excess?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxviii-p64">But dost thou love enjoyment? Then, on this
very account cease being drunken. For I, too, would have thee
enjoy thyself, but with the real enjoyment, that which never
fadeth. What then is the real enjoyment, ever blooming? Invite

partake of thine, or rather of His own. This bringeth pleasure
without limit, and in its prime everlastingly. But the things of
sense are not such; rather as soon as they appear they vanish away;
and he that hath enjoyed them will be in no better condition than
he who hath not, or rather in a worse. For the one is settled as
it were in a harbor, but the other exposes himself to a kind of
torrent, a besieging army of distempers, and hath not even any
power to endure the first swell of the sea.<note place="end" n="156" id="iv.xxviii-p65.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxviii-p66"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxviii-p66.1">τήν ζάλην ταύτην</span>.</p></note></p>

after moderation. For thus we shall both be in a good state of

<p class="c24" id="iv.xxix-p4"><span class="c18" id="iv.xxix-p4.1">What</span> mean these words, when
another object is proposed to us? This is Paul’s custom, as
also I said before, not only to treat of those things which he had
proposed to himself, but also if an argument incidental to his
purpose occur, to proceed upon this also with great diligence, and
especially when it relates to very necessary and urgent matters.
Thus, when he was discoursing with married persons, and the
question about the servants fell in his way, he handled it very
strenuously and at great length. Again, when he was speaking of
the duty of not going to law before those courts, then also having
fallen upon the admonition respecting covetousness, he discoursed
at length concerning this subject likewise. Now the same thing he
hath also done here: in that having once found occasion to remind
them of the Mysteries, he judged it necessary to proceed with that
subject. For indeed it was no ordinary one. Wherefore also he
discoursed very awfully concerning it, providing for that which is
the sum of all good things, viz. their approaching those Mysteries
with a pure conscience. Whence neither was he content with the
things said before alone, but adds these also, saying,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxix-p5">“But let a man prove himself:” which also he
saith in the second Epistle: “try your own selves, prove your
own selves:” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. xiii. 5" id="iv.xxix-p5.1" parsed="|2Cor|13|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.13.5">2 Cor.
xiii. 5</scripRef>.) not as we do
now, approaching because of the season rather than from any
earnestness of mind. For we do not consider how we may approach
prepared, with the ills that were within us purged out, and full of
compunction, but how we may come at festivals and whenever all do
so. But not thus did Paul bid us come: he knoweth only one
season of access and communion, the purity of a man’s
conscience. Since if even that kind of banquet which the senses
take cognizance of cannot be partaken of by us when feverish and
full of bad humors, without risk of perishing: much more is it
unlawful for us to <pb n="164" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_164.html" id="iv.xxix-Page_164" />touch this
Table with profane lusts, which are more grievous than fevers.
Now when I say profane lusts, I mean both those of the body, and of
money, and of anger, and of malice, and, in a word, all that are
profane. And it becomes him that approacheth, first to empty
himself of all these things and so to touch that pure sacrifice.
And neither if indolently disposed and reluctantly ought he to be
compelled to approach by reason of the festival; nor, on the other
hand, if penitent and prepared, should any one prevent him because
it is not a festival. For a festival is a showing forth of good
works, and a reverence of soul, and exactness of deportment. And
if thou hast these things, thou mayest at all times keep festival
and at all times approach. Wherefore he saith, “But let each
man prove himself, and then let him approach.” And he bids not
one examine another, but each himself, making the tribunal not a
public one and the conviction without a witness.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxix-p7">What sayest thou, tell me? Is this Table
which is the cause of so many blessings and teeming with life,

will of him that approaches. For as His presence, which conveyed

them that received it not: so also the Mysteries become

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxix-p9">But why doth he eat judgment to himself? “Not
discerning the Lord’s body:” i.e., not searching, not bearing
in mind, as he ought, the greatness of the things set before him;
not estimating the weight of the gift. For if thou shouldest come
to know accurately Who it is that lies before thee, and Who He is
that gives Himself, and to whom, thou wilt need no other argument,
but this is enough for thee to use all vigilance; unless thou
shouldest be altogether fallen.</p>

among you are weak and sickly, and not a few sleep.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxix-p11">Here he no longer brings his examples from others as
he did in the case of the idol-sacrifices, relating the ancient
histories and the chastisements in the wilderness, but from the
Corinthians themselves; which also made the discourse apt to strike
them more keenly. For whereas he was saying, “he eateth
judgment to himself,” and, “he is guilty;” that he might not
seem to speak mere words, he points to deeds also and calls
themselves to witness; a kind of thing which comes home to men more
than threatening, by showing that the threat has issued in some
real fact. He was not however content with these things alone,
but from these he also introduced and confirmed the argument
concerning hell-fire, terrifying them in both ways; and solving an
inquiry which is handled everywhere. I mean, since many question
one with another, “whence arise the untimely deaths, whence the
long diseases of men;” he tells them that these unexpected events
are many of them conditional upon certain sins. “What then? 
They who are in continual health,” say you, “and come to a
green old age, do they not sin?” Nay, who durst say this? 
“How then,” say you, “do they not suffer punishment?”
Because there they shall suffer a severer one. But we, if we
would, neither here nor there need suffer it.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxix-p12"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 11.31" id="iv.xxix-p12.1" parsed="|1Cor|11|31|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.11.31">Ver. 31</scripRef>. “For if we discerned
ourselves,” saith he, “we should not be judged.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxix-p13">And he said not, “if we punished ourselves, if we
were revenged on ourselves,” but if we were only willing to
acknowledge our offence, to pass sentence on ourselves, to condemn
the things done amiss, we should be rid of the punishment both in
this world and the next. For he that condemns himself propitiates
God in two ways, both by acknowledging his sins, and by being more
on his guard for the future. But since we are not willing to do
even this light thing, as we ought to do it, not even thus doth He
endure to punish us with the world, but even thus spareth us,
exacting punishment in this world, where the penalty is for a
season and the consolation great; for the result is both
deliverance from sins, and a good hope of things to come,
alleviating the present evils. And these things he saith, at the
same time comforting the sick and rendering the rest more
serious. Wherefore he saith,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxix-p14"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 11.32" id="iv.xxix-p14.1" parsed="|1Cor|11|32|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.11.32">Ver. 32</scripRef>. “But when we are judged,
we are chastened of the Lord.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxix-p15">He said not, we are punished, he said not, we have
vengeance taken on us, but, “we are chastened.” For what is
done belongs rather to admonition than condemnation, to healing
than vengeance, to correction than punishment. And not so only
but by the threat of a greater evil he makes the present light,
saying, “that we may not be condemned with the world.” Seest
thou how he brings in hell also and that tremendous judgment-seat,
and signifies that that trial and punishment is necessary and by
all means must be? for if the faithful, and such as God especially
cares for, escape not without punishment in whatsoever things they
offend, (and this is evident from things present,) much more the
unbelieving and they who commit the unpardonable and incurable
sins.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxix-p16">[3.] <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 11.33" id="iv.xxix-p16.1" parsed="|1Cor|11|33|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.11.33">Ver. 33</scripRef>. “Wherefore when ye come
together to eat, wait one for another.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxix-p17">Thus, while their fear was yet at its height and the
terror of hell remained, he chooses again 
<pb n="165" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_165.html" id="iv.xxix-Page_165" />to bring in also the exhortation in behalf of the
poor, on account of which he said all these things; implying that
if they do not this they must partake unworthily. But if the not
imparting of our goods excludes from that Table, much more the
violently taking away. And he said not, “wherefore, when ye
come together, impart to them that need,” but, which has a more
reverential sound, “wait one for another.” For this also
prepared the way for and intimated that, and in a becoming form
introduced the exhortation. Then further to shame them,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxix-p18"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 11.34" id="iv.xxix-p18.1" parsed="|1Cor|11|34|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.11.34">Ver. 34</scripRef>. “And if any man is
hungry, let him eat at home.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxix-p19">By permitting, he hinders it, and more strongly than
by an absolute prohibition. For he brings him out of the church
and sends him to his house, hereby severely reprimanding and
ridiculing them, as slaves to the belly and unable to contain
themselves. For he said not, “if any despise the poor,” but,
“if any hunger,” discoursing as with impatient children; as
with brute beasts which are slaves to appetite. Since it would be
indeed very ridiculous, if, because they were hungry they were to
eat at home.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxix-p20">Yet he was not content with this, but added also
another more fearful thing, saying, “that your coming together be
not unto judgment:” that ye come not unto chastisement, unto
punishment, insulting the Church, dishonoring your brother.
“For for this cause ye come together,” saith he, “that ye may
love one another, that ye may profit and be profited. But if the
contrary happen, it were better for you to feed yourselves at
home.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxix-p21">This, however, he said, that he might attract them
to him the more. Yea, this was the very purpose both of his
pointing out the injury that would arise from hence, and of his
saying that condemnation was no trifling one, and terrifying them
in every way, by the Mysteries, by the sick, by those that had
died, by the other things before mentioned.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxix-p22">Then also he alarms them again in another way,
saying, “and the rest will I set in order whensoever I come:”
with reference either to some other things, or to this very
matter. For since it was likely that they would yet have some
reasons to allege, and it was not possible to set all to rights by
letter, “the things which I have charged you, let them be
observed for the present,” saith he; “but if ye have any thing
else to mention, let it be kept for my coming;” speaking either
of this matter, as I said, or of some other things not very
urgent. And this he doth that hence too he may render them more
serious. For being anxious about his coming, they would correct
the error. For the sojourning of Paul in any place was no
ordinary thing: and to signify this he said, “some are puffed
up, as though I would not come to you;” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. iv. 18" id="iv.xxix-p22.1" parsed="|1Cor|4|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.4.18">1 Cor. iv. 18</scripRef>.) and elsewhere again, “not
as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out
your own salvation with fear and trembling.” (<scripRef passage="Philip. ii. 12" id="iv.xxix-p22.2" parsed="|Phil|2|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Phil.2.12">Philip. ii. 12</scripRef>.) And therefore neither did
he merely promise that he would come, lest they should disbelieve
him and become more negligent; but he also states a necessary cause
for his sojourning with them, saying, “the rest I will set in
order when I come; which implies, that the correction of the things
that remained, even had he not in any case been desirous, would
have drawn him thither.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxix-p23">[4.] Hearing therefore all these things, let us
both take great care of the poor, and restrain our appetite, and
rid ourselves of drunkenness, and be careful worthily to partake of
the Mysteries; and whatsoever we suffer, let us not take it
bitterly, neither for ourselves nor for others; as when untimely
death happen or long diseases. For this is deliverance from
punishment, this is correction, this is most excellent
admonition. Who saith this? He that hath Christ speaking in
him.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxix-p24">But nevertheless even after this many of our
women are so foolishly disposed as even to go beyond the
unbelievers in the excess of their grief<note place="end" n="158" id="iv.xxix-p24.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxix-p25"> For the sentiments of Christian antiquity
about mourning at funerals, see S. Cyprian, <i>De Mortalitate</i>,
c. 15, 16.</p></note>. And some do this blinded by
their passion, but others for ostentation, and to avoid the
censures of them that are without: who most of all are deprived
of excuse, to my mind. For, “lest such a one accuse me,”
saith she, “let God be my accuser: lest men more senseless than
the brute beasts condemn me, let the law of the King of all be
trampled under foot.” Why, how many thunderbolts do not these
sayings deserve?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxix-p26">Again; If any one invite you to a funeral
supper<note place="end" n="159" id="iv.xxix-p26.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxix-p27"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxix-p27.1">πέριδειπνον</span>.</p></note> after your
affliction there is no one to say any thing against it, because
there is a law of men which enjoins such things: but when God by
His law forbids your mourning, all thus contradict it. Doth not
Job come into thy mind, O woman? Rememberest thou not his words
at the misfortune of his children, which adorned that holy head
more than ten thousand crowns, and made proclamation louder than
many trumpets? Dost thou make no account of the greatness of his
misfortunes, of that unprecedented shipwreck, and that strange and
portentous tragedy? For thou possibly hast lost one, or a second,
or third: but he so many sons and daughters: and he that had
many children suddenly became childless. And not even by degrees
were his bowels wasted away: but at one sweep all the fruit of
his body was <pb n="166" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_166.html" id="iv.xxix-Page_166" />snatched
from him. Nor was it by the common law of nature, when they had
come to old age, but by a death both untimely and violent: and
all together, and when he was not present nor sitting by them, that
at least by hearing their last words he might have some consolation
for so bitter an end of theirs: but contrary to all expectation
and without his knowing any thing of what took place, they were all
at once overwhelmed, and their house became their grave and their
snare.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxix-p28">And not only their untimely death, but many things
besides there were to grieve him; such as their being all in the
flower of their age, all virtuous and loving, all together, that
not one of either sex was left, that it befel them not by the
common law of nature, that it came after so great a loss, that when
he was unconscious of any sin on his own part or on theirs, he
suffered these things. For each of these circumstances is enough
even by itself to disturb the mind: but when we find them even
concurring together, imagine the height of those waves, how great
the excess of that storm. And what in particular is greater and
worse than his bereavement, he did not even know wherefore all
these things happened. On this account then, having no cause to
assign for the misfortune, he ascends to the good pleasure of God,
and saith, “The Lord gave, the Lord hath taken away:” as it
pleased the Lord, even so it happened; “blessed be the name of
the Lord for ever.” (<scripRef passage="Job ii. 21" id="iv.xxix-p28.1" parsed="|Job|2|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Job.2.21">Job ii. 21</scripRef>.) And these things he said,
when he saw himself who had followed after all virtue in the last
extremity; but evil men and impostors, prospering, luxurious,
revelling on all sides. And he uttered no such word as it is
likely that some of the weaker sort would have uttered, “Was it
for this that I brought up my children and trained them with all
exactness? For this did I open my house to all that passed by,
that after those many courses run in behalf of the needy, the
naked, the orphans, I might receive this recompense?” But
instead of these, he offered up those words better than all
sacrifice, saying, “Naked came I out of my mother’s womb, and
naked shall I return thither.” If however he rent his clothes
and shaved his head, marvel not. For he was a father and a loving
father: and it was meet that both the compassion of his nature
should be shown, and also the self-command of his spirit.
Whereas, had he not done this, perhaps one would have thought this
self-command to be of mere insensibility. Therefore he indicates
both his natural affection and the exactness of his piety, and in
his grief he was not overthrown.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxix-p29">[5.] Yea, and when his trial proceeded further, he
is again adorned with other crowns on account of his reply to his
wife, saying, “If we have received good at the hand of the Lord,
shall we not endure evil?” (<scripRef passage="Job ii. 10" id="iv.xxix-p29.1" parsed="|Job|2|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Job.2.10">Job ii. 10</scripRef>.) For in fact his wife was
by this time the only one left, all his having been clean
destroyed, both his children and his possessions and his very body,
and she reserved to tempt and to ensnare him. And this indeed was
the reason why the devil did not destroy her with the children, nor
asked her death, because he expected that she would contribute much
towards the ensnaring of that holy man. Therefore he left her as
a kind of implement, and a formidable one, for himself. “For if
even out of paradise,” saith he, “I cast mankind by her means,
much more shall I be able to trip him up on the dunghill.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxix-p30">And observe his craft. He did not apply this
stratagem when the oxen or the asses or the camels were lost, nor
even when the house fell and the children were buried under it, but
so long looking on the combatant, he suffers her to be silent and
quiet.  But when the fountain of worms gushed forth, when the skin
began to putrify and drop off, and the flesh wasting away to emit
most offensive discharge, and the hand of the devil was wearing him
out with sharper pain than gridirons and furnaces and any flame,
consuming on every side and eating away his body more grievously
than any wild beast, and when a long time had been spent in this
misery<note place="end" n="160" id="iv.xxix-p30.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxix-p31"> The LXX begin

had passed.”</p></note>; then he
brings her to him, seasoned and worn down. Whereas if she had
approached him at the beginning of his misfortune, neither would
she have found him so unnerved, nor would she have had it in her
power so to swell out and exaggerate the misfortune by her words.
But now when she saw him through the length of time thirsting for
release, and desiring the termination of what pressed on him
vehemently then doth she come upon him. For to show that he was
quite worn down, and by this time had become unable even to draw
breath, yea, and desired even to die, hear what he saith; “For I
would I could lay hands on myself, or could request another and he
should do it for me;” And observe, I pray, the wickedness of
his wife, from what topic she at once begins: namely, from the
length of time, saying, “How long wilt thou hold out<note place="end" n="161" id="iv.xxix-p31.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxix-p32"> <scripRef passage="Job ii. 9" id="iv.xxix-p32.1" parsed="|Job|2|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Job.2.9">Job ii.
9</scripRef>. where, according to
the LXX, the speech of Job’s wife stands as follows: “How
long wilt thou be patient, saying, Lo, let me endure yet a little
while, awaiting the hope of my salvation? For behold, thy
memorial is vanished from the earth, even sons and daughters, the
throes and labors of my womb, for whom I have wearied myself in
vain with toils: and thou thyself in corruption of worms sittest
all night in the open air, while I am a wanderer and a servant,
from place to place, and from house to house, awaiting the sun when
it will set, that I may rest from my labors and the pains which now
straiten me: but say some word against the Lord, and die.”</p></note>?”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxix-p33">Now, if often even when there were no realities
words alone have prevailed to unman a person, consider what it was
likely he then <pb n="167" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_167.html" id="iv.xxix-Page_167" />should feel,
when, besides these words, the things themselves also were galling
him; and what, as it should seem, was worst of all, it was a wife
also who spake thus, and a wife who had sunk down utterly and was
giving herself up, and on this account was seeking to cast him also
into desperation. However, that we may see more clearly the
engine which was brought against that adamantine wall, let us
listen to the very words. What then are these? “How long wilt
thou hold out? saying, Lo! I wait a short time longer, expecting
the hope of my salvation.” “Nay,” saith she, “the time
hath exposed the folly of thy words, while it is protracted, yet
shows no mode of escape.” And these things she said, not only
thrusting him into desperation, but also reproaching and jesting
upon him.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxix-p34">For he, ever consoling her as she pressed upon him,
and putting her off, would speak as follows: “Wait a little
longer, and there will soon be an end of these things.”
Reproaching him therefore, she speaks: “Wilt thou now again say
the same thing? For a long time hath now run by, and no end of
these things hath appeared.” And observe her malice, that she
makes no mention of the oxen, the sheep or the camels, as knowing
that he was not very much vexed about these; but she goes at once
to nature, and reminds him of his children. For on their death
she saw him both rending his clothes and shaving off his hair.
And she said not, “thy children are dead,” but very
pathetically, “thy memorial is perished from the earth,” “the
thing for which thy children were desirable.” For if, even now
after that the resurrection hath been made known children are
longed for because they preserve the memory of the departed; much
more then. Wherefore also her curse becomes from that
consideration more bitter. For in that case, he that cursed, said
not, “Let his children be utterly rooted out,” but, “his
memorial from the earth.” “Thy sons and thy daughters.”
Thus whereas she said, “the memorial,” she again accurately
makes mention of either sex. “But if thou,” saith she,
“carest not for these, at least consider what is mine.”
“The pains of my womb, and labors which I have endured in vain
with sorrow.” Now what she means is this: “I, who endured
the more, am wronged for thy sake, and having undergone the toils I
am deprived of the fruits.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxix-p35">And see how she neither makes express mention of his
loss of property, nor is silent about it and hurries by; but in
that point of view in which it also might be most pathetically
narrated, in that she covertly refers to it. For when she says,
“I too am a vagabond and a slave, going about from place to
place, from house to house,” she both hints at the loss and
indicates her great distress: these expressions being such as
even to enhance that misfortune. “For I come to the doors of
others,” saith she; “nor do I beg only, but am a wanderer also
and serve a strange and unusual servitude, going round everywhere
and carrying about the tokens of my calamity, and teaching all men
of my woes;” which is most piteous of all, to change house after
house. And she stayed not even at these lamentations, but
proceeded to say, “Waiting for the sun when it will set, and I
shall rest from my miseries and the pains that encompass me, by
which I am now straitened.” “Thus, that which is sweet to
others,” saith she, “to behold the light, this to me is
grievous: but the night and the darkness is a desirable thing.
For this only gives me rest from my toils, this becometh a comfort
to my miseries. But speak somewhat against the Lord, and
die.” Perceivest thou here too her crafty wickedness? how she
did not even in the act of advising at once introduce the deadly
counsel, but having first pitifully related her misfortunes and
having drawn out the tragedy at length, she couches in a few words
what she would recommend, and doth not even declare it plainly, but
throwing a shade over that, she holds out to him the deliverance
which he greatly longed for, and promises death, the thing which he
then most of all desired.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxix-p36">And mark from this also the malice of the devil: 
that because he knew the longing of Job towards God, he suffers not
his wife to accuse God, lest he should at once turn away from her
as an enemy. For this cause she no where mentions Him, but the
actual calamities she is continually harping on.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxix-p37">And do thou, besides what has been said, add the
circumstance that it was a woman who gave this counsel, a wonderful
orator to beguile the heedless. Many at least even without
external accidents have been cast down by the counsel of woman
alone.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxix-p38">[6.] What then did the blessed saint, and firmer
than adamant? Looking bitterly upon her, by his aspect even
before he spake, he repelled her devices: since she no doubt
expected to excite fountains of tears; but he became fiercer than a
lion, full of wrath and indignation, not on account of his
sufferings, but on account of her diabolical suggestions; and
having signified his anger by his looks in a subdued tone he gives
his rebuke; for even in misfortune he kept his self-command. And
what saith he? “Why speakest thou as one of the foolish
women?” “I have not so taught thee,” saith he, “I did not
so nurture thee; and this is why I do not now recognize even mine
own consort. For these words are the counsel of a ‘foolish
woman,’ and of one beside herself.” Seest 
<pb n="168" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_168.html" id="iv.xxix-Page_168" />thou not here an instance of wounding in
moderation, and inflicting a blow just sufficient to cure the
disease?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxix-p39">Then, after the infliction, he brings in advice
sufficient on the other hand to console her, and very rational,
thus speaking: “if we have received our good things at the hand
of the Lord, shall we not endure our evils?” “For
remember,” saith he, “those former things and make account of
the Author of them, and thou wilt bear even these nobly.” Seest
thou the modesty of the man? that he doth not at all impute his
patience to his own courage, but saith it was part of the natural
result of what happened. “For in return for what did God give
us these former things? What recompense did he repay? None, but
from mere goodness. For they were a gift, not a recompense; a
grace, not a reward. Well then, let us bear these also
nobly.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxix-p40">This discourse let us, both men and women,
have recorded, and let us engrave the words in our minds, both

<p class="c27" id="iv.xxx-p3">Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would
not have you ignorant. Ye know that when ye were Gentiles, ye
were led away unto those dumb idols, howsoever ye might be led.</p>

<p class="c24" id="iv.xxx-p4"><span class="c18" id="iv.xxx-p4.1">This</span> whole place is very
obscure: but the obscurity is produced by our ignorance of the
facts referred to and by their cessation, being such as then used
to occur but now no longer take place. And why do they not happen
now? Why look now, the cause too of the obscurity hath produced
us again another question: namely, why did they then happen, and
now do so no more?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxx-p5">This however let us defer to another time, but for
the present let us state what things were occurring then. Well: 
what did happen then? Whoever was baptized he straightway spake
with tongues and not with tongues only, but many also prophesied,
and some also performed many other wonderful works. For since on
their coming over from idols, without any clear knowledge or
training in the ancient Scriptures, they at once on their baptism
received the Spirit, yet the Spirit they saw not, for It is
invisible; therefore God’s grace bestowed some sensible proof of
that energy. And one straightway spake in the Persian, another in
the Roman, another in the Indian, another in some other such
tongue: and this made manifest to them that were without that it
is the Spirit in the very person speaking. Wherefore also he so
calls it, saying, “But to each one the manifestation of the
Spirit is given to profit withal;” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. 12.7" id="iv.xxx-p5.1" parsed="|1Cor|12|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.12.7">v. 7</scripRef>.)
calling the gifts “a manifestation of the Spirit.” For as the
Apostles themselves had received this sign first, so also the
faithful went on receiving it, I mean, the gift of tongues; yet not
this only but also many others: inasmuch as many used even to
raise the dead and to cast out devils and to perform many other
such wonders: and they had gifts too, some less, and some more.
But more abundant than all was the gift of tongues among them: 
and this became to them a cause of division; not from its own
nature but from the perverseness of them that had received it: in
that on the one hand the possessors of the greater gifts were
lifted up against them that had the lesser: and these again were
grieved, and envied the owners of the greater. And Paul himself
as he proceeds intimates this. </p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxx-p6">Since then herefrom they were receiving a fatal blow
in the dissolution of their charity, he takes great care to correct
it. For this happened indeed in Rome also, but not in the same
way. And this is why in the Epistle to the Romans he moots it
indeed, but obscurely and briefly, saying thus: “For even as we
have many members in one body, and all the members have not <pb n="169" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_169.html" id="iv.xxx-Page_169" />the same office; so we, who are many,
are one body in Christ, and severally members one of another. And
having gifts differing according to the grace that was given to us,
whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of
our faith; or ministry, let us give ourselves to our ministry; or
he that teacheth to his teaching.” (<scripRef passage="Rom. xii. 4-8" id="iv.xxx-p6.1" parsed="|Rom|12|4|12|8" osisRef="Bible:Rom.12.4-Rom.12.8">Rom. xii. 4–8</scripRef>.) And that the Romans also
were falling into wilfulness hereby, this he intimates in the
beginning of that discourse, thus saying: “For I say through
the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to
think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but so to
think as to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to each man
a measure of faith.” (<scripRef passage="Rom. xii. 3" id="iv.xxx-p6.2" parsed="|Rom|12|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.12.3">Rom. xii. 3</scripRef>.) With these, however, (for
the disease of division and pride had not proceeded to any length,)
he thus discoursed: but here with great anxiety; for the
distemper had greatly spread.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxx-p7">And this was not the only thing to disturb them, but
there were also in the place many soothsayers, inasmuch as the city
was more than usually addicted to Grecian customs, and this with
the rest was tending to offence and disturbance among them. This
is the reason why he begins by first stating the difference between
soothsaying and prophecy. For this cause also they received
discerning of spirits, so as to discern and know which is he that
speaketh by a pure spirit, and which by an impure.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxx-p8">For because it was not possible to supply the
evidence of the things uttered from within themselves at the
moment; (for prophecy supplies the proof of its own truth not at
the time when it is spoken, but at the time of the event;) and it
was not easy to distinguish the true prophesier from the pretender;
(for the devil himself, accursed as he is, had entered into them
that prophesied, [See <scripRef passage="1 Kings xxii. 23" id="iv.xxx-p8.1" parsed="|1Kgs|22|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Kgs.22.23">1
Kings xxii. 23</scripRef>.] bringing
in false prophets, as if forsooth they also could foretell things
to come;) and further, men were easily deceived, because the things
spoken could not for the present be brought to trial, ere yet the
events had come to pass concerning which the prophecy was; (for it
was the end that proved the false prophet and the true:)—in order
that the hearers might not be deceived before the end, he gives
them a sign which even before the event served to indicate the one
and the other. And hence taking his order and beginning, he thus
goes on also to the discourse concerning the gifts and corrects the
contentiousness that arose from hence likewise. For the present
however he begins the discourse concerning the soothsayers, thus
saying,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxx-p9">[2.] “Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren,
I would not have you ignorant;” calling the signs
“spiritual,” because they are the works of the Spirit alone,
human effort contributing nothing to the working such wonders.
And intending to discourse concerning them, first, as I said, he
lays down the difference between soothsaying and prophecy, thus
saying,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxx-p10">“Ye know that when ye were Gentiles, ye were
led away<note place="end" n="164" id="iv.xxx-p10.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxx-p11"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxx-p11.1">ἀ</span><span class="Greek" id="iv.xxx-p11.2">παγόμενοι</span>, properly “dragged to prison or
execution.”</p></note> unto those
dumb idols, howsoever ye might be led.” Now what he means is
this: “In the idol-temples,” saith he, “if any were at any
time possessed by an unclean spirit and began to divine, even as
one dragged away, so was he drawn by that spirit in chains: 
knowing nothing of the things which he utters. For this is
peculiar to the soothsayer, to be beside himself, to be under
compulsion, to be pushed, to be dragged, to be haled as a madman.
But the prophet not so, but with sober mind and composed temper and
knowing what he is saying, he uttereth all things. Therefore even
before the event do thou from this distinguish the soothsayer and
the prophet. And consider how he frees his discourse of all
suspicion; calling themselves to witness who had made trial of the
matter. As if he had said, “that I lie not nor rashly traduce
the religion of the Gentiles, feigning like an enemy, do ye
yourselves bear me witness: knowing as ye do, when ye were
Gentiles, how ye were pulled and dragged away then.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxx-p12">But if any should say that these too are
suspected as believers, come, even from them that are without will
I make this manifest to you. Hear, for example, Plato saying
thus: (Apol. Soc. c. 7.) “Even as they who deliver oracles
and the soothsayers say many and excellent things, but know nothing
of what they utter.” Hear again another, a poet, giving the
same intimation. For whereas by certain mystical rites and
witchcrafts a certain person had imprisoned a demon in a man, and
the man divined, and in his divination was thrown down and torn,
and was unable to endure the violence of the demon, but was on the
point of perishing in that convulsion; he saith to the persons who
were practicing such mystical arts,<note place="end" n="165" id="iv.xxx-p12.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxx-p13"> These verses are taken from an old Oracle,
quoted among others by Porphyry in a Treatise <i>of the Philosophy
of Oracles</i>, and from him again by Theodoret, on <i>the Remedies

<p class="c30" id="iv.xxx-p14">Loose me, I pray you:</p>

<p class="c22" id="iv.xxx-p18">Unbind my wreaths, and bathe my feet in drops</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxx-p19">From the pure stream; erase these mystic
lines,<note place="end" n="166" id="iv.xxx-p19.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxx-p20"> Porphyry’s note on this verse, as quoted by Hales
from Eusebius (Evang. Præp. v.) in Savile’s Chrysostom, viii.
pt. ii. p. 278, is as follows: “You see, he bids them erase the
lines that he may depart: as though these detained him, and not
only these, but the other things too about their apparel: because
they wore certain portraitures of the deities who were
invoked.”</p></note></p>

<p class="c31" id="iv.xxx-p21">And let me go.</p>

<p id="iv.xxx-p22">For these and such like things, (for one might <pb n="170" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_170.html" id="iv.xxx-Page_170" />mention many more,) point out
to us both of these facts which follow; the compulsion which holds
down the demons and makes them slaves; and the violence to which
they submit who have once given themselves up to them, so as to
swerve even from their natural reason. And the Pythoness too<note place="end" n="167" id="iv.xxx-p22.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxx-p23"> See Strabo, ix. 5.</p></note>: (for I am
compelled now to bring forward and expose another disgraceful
custom of theirs, which it were well to pass by, because it is
unseemly for us to mention such things; but that you may more
clearly know their shame it is necessary to mention it, that hence
at least ye may come to know the madness and exceeding mockery of
those that make use of the soothsayers:)  this same Pythoness then
is said, being a female, to sit at times upon the tripod of Apollo
astride, and thus the evil spirit ascending from beneath and
entering the lower part of her body, fills the woman with madness,
and she with dishevelled hair begins to play the bacchanal and to
foam at the mouth, and thus being in a frenzy to utter the words of
her madness. I know that you are ashamed and blush when you hear
these things: but they glory both in the disgrace and in the
madness which I have described. These then and all such things.
Paul was bringing forward when he said, “Ye know that when ye
were Gentiles, ye were led away unto those dumb idols, howsoever ye
might be led.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxx-p24">And because he was discoursing with those who knew
well, he states not all things with exact care, not wishing to be
troublesome to them, but having reminded them only and brought all
into their recollection, he soon quits the point, hastening to the
subject before him.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxx-p25">But what is, “unto those dumb idols?” These
soothsayers used to be led and dragged unto them.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxx-p26">But if they be themselves dumb, how did they give
responses to others? And wherefore did the demon lead them to the
images? As men taken in war, and in chains, and rendering at the
same time his deceit plausible. Thus, to keep men from the notion
that it was just a dumb stone, they were earnest to rivet the
people to the idols that their own style and title might be
inscribed upon them. But our rites are not such. He did not
however state ours, I mean the prophesyings. For it was well
known to them all, and prophecy was exercised among them, as was
meet for their condition, with understanding and with entire
freedom. Therefore, you see, they had power either to speak or to
refrain from speaking. For they were not bound by necessity, but
were honored with a privilege. For this cause Jonah fled; (<scripRef passage="Jonah i. 3" id="iv.xxx-p26.1" parsed="|Jonah|1|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Jonah.1.3">Jonah i. 3</scripRef>.) for this cause Ezekiel
delayed; (<scripRef passage="Ezek. iii. 15" id="iv.xxx-p26.2" parsed="|Ezek|3|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ezek.3.15">Ezek. iii.
15</scripRef>.) for this cause
Jeremiah excused himself. (<scripRef passage="Jer. i. 6" id="iv.xxx-p26.3" parsed="|Jer|1|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Jer.1.6">Jer. i. 6</scripRef>.) And God thrusts them not
on by compulsion, but advising, exhorting, threatening; not
darkening their mind; for to cause distraction and madness and
great darkness, is the proper work of a demon: but it is God’s
work to illuminate and with consideration to teach things
needful.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxx-p27">[3.] This then is the first difference between a
soothsayer and a prophet; but a second and a different one is that
which he next states, saying,</p>

not uttering His name, or anathematizing Him, he is a soothsayer.
Again, when thou seest another speaking all things with His Name,
understand that he is spiritual.” “What then,” say you,
“must we say concerning the Catechumens? For if, no man can say
that Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy Ghost, what must we say of
them who name indeed His Name, but are destitute of His Spirit<note place="end" n="168" id="iv.xxx-p29.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxx-p30"> So St. Austin, Tract 11. on St. John: “Inasmuch

discourse at this time was not concerning these for there were not
at that time Catechumens, but concerning believers and
unbelievers. What then, doth no demon call upon God’s Name? 
Did not the demoniacs say, “We know Thee who Thou art, the Holy
One of God? (<scripRef passage="Mark i. 24" id="iv.xxx-p30.2" parsed="|Mark|1|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Mark.1.24">Mark

scourging, upon compulsion; never of their own will and without
being scourged.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxx-p31">But here it is proper to enquire, both why the
demon uttered these things and why Paul rebuked him. In imitation
of his Teacher; for so Christ did also rebuke: since it was not
his will to have testimony from them. And wherefore did the devil
also practise this? Intending to confound the order of things,
and to seize upon the dignity of the Apostles, and to persuade many
to pay attention to them<note place="end" n="169" id="iv.xxx-p31.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxx-p32"> Sav. in marg. reads <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxx-p32.1"> αὐτοῖς</span>. Bened. <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxx-p32.2">αὐτῷ</span>.</p></note>: which had it happened, they

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxx-p33">[4.] Having therefore made manifest the <pb n="171" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_171.html" id="iv.xxx-Page_171" />soothsayers and the prophets both by
the first sign and also by the second, he next discourses of the
wonders; not passing without reason to this topic, but so as to
remove the dissension which had thence arisen, and to persuade both
those that had the less portion not to grieve and those who had the
greater not to be elated. Wherefore also he thus began.</p>

“Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxx-p35">And first he attends on him that had the lesser
gift, and was grieved on this account. “For wherefore,” saith
he, “art thou dejected? because thou hast not received as much as
another? Still, consider that it is a free gift and not a debt,
and thou wilt be able to soothe thy pain.” For this cause he
spake thus in the very beginning: “but there are diversities of
gifts.” And he said not “of signs,” nor “of wonders,”
but of “gifts,” by the name of free gifts prevailing on them
not only not to grieve but even to be thankful. “And withal
consider this also,” saith he, “that even if thou art made
inferior in the measure of what is given; in that it hath been
vouchsafed thee to receive from the same source as the other who
hath received more, thou hast equal honor. For certainly thou
canst not say that the Spirit bestowed the gift on him, but an
angel on thee: since the Spirit bestowed it both on thee and
him. Wherefore he added, “but the same Spirit.” So that
even if there be a difference in the gift, yet is there no
difference in the Giver. For from the same Fountain ye are
drawing, both thou and he.</p>

“And there are diversities of ministrations, but the same
Lord.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxx-p37">Thus, enriching the consolation, he adds mention of
the Son also, and of the Father. And again, he calls these gifts
by another name, designing by this also an increase of
consolation. Wherefore also he thus said: “there are
diversities of ministrations, but the same Lord.” For he that
hears of “a gift,” and hath received a less share, perhaps
might grieve; but when we speak of “a ministration,” the case
is different. For the thing implies labor and sweat. “Why
grievest thou then,” saith he, “if he hath bidden another labor
more, sparing thee?”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxx-p38"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 12.6" id="iv.xxx-p38.1" parsed="|1Cor|12|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.12.6">Ver. 6</scripRef>.

“But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit to

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxx-p40">“And what,” saith one, “is a working?” and
what “a gift?” and what “a ministration?” They are mere
differences of names, since the things are the same. For what
“a gift” is, that is “a ministration,” that he calls “an
operation” also. Thus fulfil thy ministry; (<scripRef passage="2 Tim. iv. 5" id="iv.xxx-p40.1" parsed="|2Tim|4|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Tim.4.5">2 Tim. iv. 5</scripRef>. <i>ministry</i>.) and,

Galatians, he said, “for he that wrought in Peter to the
Apostleship, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles.
(<scripRef passage="Gal. ii. 8" id="iv.xxx-p40.4" parsed="|Gal|2|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gal.2.8">Gal. ii. 8</scripRef>.) Seest thou that he
implies that there is no difference in the gifts of the Father, and
the Son, and the Holy Ghost? Not confounding<note place="end" n="170" id="iv.xxx-p40.5"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxx-p41"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxx-p41.1">τὰς ὑποστάσεις

declaring the equal honor of the Essence. For that which the
Spirit bestows, this he saith that God also works; this, that the
Son likewise ordains and grants. Yet surely if the one were
inferior to the other, or the other to it, he would not have thus
set it down nor would this have been his way of consoling the
person who was vexed.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxx-p42">[5.] Now after this, he comforts him also in
another kind of way; by the consideration that the measure
vouchsafed is profitable to him, even though it be not so large.
For having said, that it is “the same Spirit,” and “the same
Lord,” and “the same God,” and having thereby recovered him,
he brings in again another consolation, thus saying, “but to each
one is given the manifestation of the Spirit to profit withal.”
For lest one should say, “what if there be the same Lord, the
same Spirit, the same God? yet I have received less:” he saith,
that thus it was profitable.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxx-p43">But he calls miracles a “manifestation of the
Spirit,” with evident reason. For to me who am a believer, he
that hath the Spirit is manifest from his having been baptized: 
but to the unbeliever this will in no wise be manifest, except from
the miracles: so that hence also again there is no small
consolation. For though there be a difference of gifts, yet the
evidence is one: since whether thou hast much or little, thou art
equally manifest. So that if thou desirest to show this, that
thou hast the Spirit, thou hast a sufficient demonstration.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxx-p44">Wherefore, now that both the Giver is one and the
thing given a pure favor, and the manifestation takes place
thereby, and this is more profitable for thee; grieve not as if
despised. For not to dishonor thee hath God done it, nor to
declare thee inferior to another, but to spare thee and with a view
to thy welfare. To receive more than one has ability to bear,
this rather is unprofitable, and injurious, and a fit cause of
dejection.</p>

one and the same Spirit.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxx-p51">The universal medicine in which his consolation
consists is that out of the same root, out of the same treasures,
out of the same streams, they all receive. And accordingly, from
time to time dwelling on this expression, he levels the apparent
inequality, and consoles them. And above indeed he points out
both the Spirit, and the Son, and the Father, as supplying the
gifts, but here he was content to make the Spirit, that even hence
again thou mayest understand their dignity to be the same.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxx-p52">But what is “the word of wisdom?” That which
Paul had, which John had, the son of thunder.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxx-p53">And what is “the word of knowledge?” That
which most of the faithful had, possessing indeed knowledge, but
not thereupon able to teach nor easily to convey to another what
they knew.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxx-p54">“And to another, faith:” not meaning by this
faith the faith of doctrines, but the faith of miracles; concerning
which Christ saith, “If ye have faith as a grain of mustard-seed,
ye shall say to this mountain, Remove, and it shall remove.”
(S. <scripRef passage="Matt. xvii. 20" id="iv.xxx-p54.1" parsed="|Matt|17|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.17.20">Matt. xvii. 20</scripRef>.) And the Apostles too
concerning this besought Him, saying, “Increase our faith:”
(S. <scripRef passage="Luke xvii. 5" id="iv.xxx-p54.2" parsed="|Luke|17|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.17.5">Luke xvii. 5</scripRef>.) for this is the mother of
the miracles. But to possess the power of working miracles and
gifts of healing, is not the same thing: for he that had a gift
of healing used only to do cures: but he that possessed powers
for working miracles used to punish also. For a miracle is not
the healing only, but the punishing also: even as Paul inflicted
blindness: as Peter slew.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxx-p55">“To another prophecies; and to another discernings

who is spiritual, and who is not: who is a prophet, and who a

prophesyings:” (<scripRef passage="1 Thess. v. 20, 21" id="iv.xxx-p55.1" parsed="|1Thess|5|20|5|21" osisRef="Bible:1Thess.5.20-1Thess.5.21">1

prophets, the devil striving underhand to substitute falsehood for
the truth. “To another divers kinds of tongues; to another the
interpretation of tongues.” For one person knew what he spake
himself, but was unable to interpret to another; while another had
acquired both these or the other of the two. Now this seemed to
be a great gift because both the Apostles received it first, and
the most among the Corinthians had obtained it. But the word of
teaching not so. Wherefore that he places first, but this last: 
for this was on account of that, and so indeed were all the rest;
both prophecies, and working of miracles, and divers kinds of
tongues, and interpretation of tongues. For none is equal to
this. Wherefore also he said, “Let the elders that rule well be
counted worthy of double honor, especially they who labor in the
word and in teaching.” (<scripRef passage="1 Tim. v. 17" id="iv.xxx-p57.2" parsed="|1Tim|5|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.5.17">1 Tim. v. 17</scripRef>.) And to Timothy he wrote,
saying, “Give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to teaching;
neglect not the gift that is in thee.” (<scripRef passage="1 Tim. iv. 13, 14" id="iv.xxx-p57.3" parsed="|1Tim|4|13|4|14" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.4.13-1Tim.4.14">1 Tim. iv. 13, 14</scripRef>.) Seest thou how he calls it
also a gift?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxx-p58">[6.] Next, the comfort which he before gave,
when he said, “the same Spirit,” this also he here sets before
us, saying, “But all these worketh the one and the same Spirit,
dividing to each one severally even as he will.” And he not
only gives consolation but also stops the mouth of the gainsayer,
saying here, “dividing to each one severally even as he
will.” For it was necessary to bind<note place="end" n="173" id="iv.xxx-p58.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxx-p59"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxx-p59.1">ἐ</span><span class="Greek" id="iv.xxx-p59.2">πιστύφειν</span>.</p></note> up also, not to heal only, as he
doth also in the Epistle to the Romans, when he saith, “But who
art thou that repliest against God? (<scripRef passage="Rom. ix. 20" id="iv.xxx-p59.3" parsed="|Rom|9|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.9.20">Rom. ix. 20</scripRef>.) So likewise here,
“dividing to each one severally as he will.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxx-p60">And that which was of the Father, this he
signifieth to be of the Spirit also. For as concerning the
Father, he saith, “but it is the same God who worketh all things
in all;” so also concerning the Spirit, “but all these things
worketh one and the same Spirit.” But,<note place="end" n="174" id="iv.xxx-p60.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxx-p61"> In this and other places of this Homily, S.
Chrysostom seems to have had in view the controversy, then recent,
with the Macedonians, who denied the Divinity of the Holy

actuated by God.” Nay, he no where said this, but thou feignest
it. For when he saith, “who actuateth<note place="end" n="175" id="iv.xxx-p61.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxx-p62"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxx-p62.1">ἐ</span><span class="Greek" id="iv.xxx-p62.2">νεργῶν</span> “worketh.”</p></note> all things in all,” he saith this
concerning men: thou wilt hardly say that among those men he
numbers also the Spirit, though thou shouldst be ever so manifold
in thy doting and madness. For because he had said “through the
Spirit,” that thou mightest not suppose this word, “through,”
to denote inferiority or the being actuated, he adds, that “the
Spirit worketh,” not “is worked,”<note place="end" n="176" id="iv.xxx-p62.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxx-p63"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxx-p63.1">ἐ</span><span class="Greek" id="iv.xxx-p63.2">νεργεῖ, οὐκ ἐυεργεῖται</span>.</p></note> and worketh “as he will,” not
as he is bidden. For as concerning the Father, the Son saith that
“He raiseth up the dead and quickeneth;” in like manner also,
concerning <pb n="173" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_173.html" id="iv.xxx-Page_173" />Himself, that
“He quickeneth whom He will:” (S. 
<scripRef passage="John v. 21" id="iv.xxx-p63.3" parsed="|John|5|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.5.21">John v. 21</scripRef>.) thus also of the Spirit, in
another place, that He doeth all things with authority and that
there is nothing that hinders Him; (for the expression, “bloweth
where it listeth” [S. 
<scripRef passage="John iii. 8" id="iv.xxx-p63.4" parsed="|John|3|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.3.8">John iii. 8</scripRef>,] though it be spoken of the
wind is apt to establish this;) but here, that “He worketh all
things as He will.” And from another place to learn that He is
not one of the things actuated, but of those that actuate. “For
who knoweth,” says he, “the things of a man, but the spirit of
the man? even so the things of God none knoweth save the Spirit of
God.” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. ii. 11" id="iv.xxx-p63.5" parsed="|1Cor|2|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.2.11">1 Cor. ii.
11</scripRef>.) Now that “the
spirit of a man,” i.e., the soul, requires not to be actuated
that it may know the things of itself, is, I suppose, evident to
every one. Therefore neither doth the Holy Ghost, that he may
“know the things of God.” For his meaning is like this,
“the secret things of God” are known to the Holy Spirit as to
the soul of man the secret things of herself.” But if this be
not actuated for that end, much less would That which knoweth the
depths of God and needs no actuation for that knowledge, require
any actuating Power in order to the giving gifts to the
Apostles.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxx-p64">But besides these things, that also, which I before
spake of, I will mention again now. What then is this? That if
the Spirit were inferior and of another substance, there would have
been no avail in his consolation, nor in our hearing the words,
“of the same Spirit.” For he who hath received from the king,
I grant, may find it a very soothing circumstance, that he himself
gave to him; but if it be from the slave, he is then rather vexed,
when one reproaches him with it. So that even hence is it
evident, that the Holy Spirit is not of the substance of the
servant, but of the King.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxx-p65">[7.] Wherefore as he comforted them, when he said,
that “there are diversities of ministrations, but the same Lord;
and diversities of operations, but the same God;” so also when he
said above, “there are diversities of gifts, but the same
Spirit;” and after this again when he said, “But all these
worketh the one and the same Spirit, dividing to every man
severally as he will.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxx-p66">“Let us not, I pray you, be at a loss,” saith
he; “neither let us grieve, saying, ‘Why have I received this
and not received that?’ neither let us demand an account of the
Holy Spirit. For if thou knowest that he vouchsafed it from
providential care, consider that from the same care he hath given
also the measure of it, and be content and rejoice in what thou
hast received: but murmur not at what thou hast not received;
yea, rather confess God’s favor that thou hast not received
things beyond thy power.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxx-p67">[5.] And if in spiritual things one ought not to
be over-curious, much more in temporal things; but to be quiet and
not nicely enquire why one is rich and another poor. For, first
of all, not every single rich man is rich from God, but many even
of unrighteousness, and rapine, and avarice. For he that forbade
to be rich, how can he have granted that which he forbade to
receive?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxx-p68">But that I may, far above what the case requires,
stop the mouths of those who concerning these things gainsay us,
come, let us carry our discourse higher up, to the time when riches
used to be given by God; and answer me. Wherefore was Abraham
rich whereas Jacob wanted even bread? Were not both the one and
the other righteous? Doth He not say concerning the three alike,
“I am the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob?” (<scripRef passage="Exod. iii. 6" id="iv.xxx-p68.1" parsed="|Exod|3|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Exod.3.6">Exod. iii. 6</scripRef>.) Wherefore then was the one
a rich man, and the other a hired servant? Or rather, why was
Esau rich, who was unrighteous and a murderer of his brother, while
Jacob was in bondage for so long a time? Wherefore again did
Isaac live in ease all his time, but Jacob in toils and miseries? 
For which cause also he said, “Few and evil are my days.”
(<scripRef passage="Gen. xlvii. 9" id="iv.xxx-p68.2" parsed="|Gen|47|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.47.9">Gen. xlvii. 9</scripRef>.)</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxx-p69">Wherefore did David, who was both a prophet and a
king, himself also live all his time in toils? whereas Solomon his
son spent forty years in security above all men, in the enjoyment
of profound peace, glory, and honor, and going through every kind
of deliciousness? What again could be the reason, that among the
prophets also one was afflicted more, and another less? Because
so it was expedient for each. Wherefore upon each our remark must
be, “Thy judgments are a great deep.” (<scripRef passage="Ps. xxxvi. 6" id="iv.xxx-p69.1" parsed="|Ps|36|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.36.6">Ps. xxxvi. 6</scripRef>.) For if those great and
wonderful men were not alike exercised by God, but one by poverty,
and another by riches; one by ease, and another by trouble; much
more ought we now to bear these things in mind.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxx-p70">[8.] But besides this, it becomes one to consider
also that many of the things which happen do not take place
according to His mind, but arise from our wickedness. Say not
then, “Why is one man rich who is wicked, and another poor who is
righteous?” For first of all, one may give an account of these
things also, and say that neither doth the righteous receive any
harm from his poverty, nay, even a greater addition of honor; and
that the bad man in his riches possesseth but a store of punishment
on his future road, unless he be changed: and, even before
punishment, often-times his riches become to him the cause of many
evils, and lead him into ten thousand pitfalls. But God permits
it, at the same to signify the free choice of the <pb n="174" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_174.html" id="iv.xxx-Page_174" />will, and also to teach all others
not to be mad nor rave after money.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxx-p71">“How is it then, when a man being wicked is rich,
and suffers nothing dreadful?” say you. “Since if being good
he hath wealth, he hath it justly: but if bad, what shall we
say?” That even therein he is to be pitied. For wealth added
to wickedness aggravates the mischief. But is he a good man, and
poor? Yet is he nothing injured. Is he then a bad man, and
poor? This is he so justly and by desert, or rather even with
advantage to himself. “But such an one,” say you, “received
his riches from his ancestors and lavishes it upon harlots and
parasites, and suffers no evil.” What sayest thou? Doth he
commit whoredom, and sayest thou, “he suffers no evils?” Is
he drunken, and thinkest thou that he is in luxury? Doth he spend
for no good, and judgest thou that he is to be envied? Nay what
can be worse than this wealth which destroys the very soul? But
thou, if the body were distorted and maimed, wouldest say that his
was a case for great lamentation; and seest thou his whole soul
mutilated, yet countest him even happy? “But he doth not
perceive it,” say you. Well then, for this very reason again is
he to be pitied, as all frantic persons are. For he that knows he
is sick will of course both seek the physician and submit to
remedies; but he that is ignorant of it will have no chance at all
of deliverance. Dost thou call such an one happy, tell me?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxx-p72">But it is no marvel: for the more part are
ignorant of the true love of wisdom. Therefore do we suffer the
extremest penalty, being chastised and not even withdrawing
ourselves from the punishment. For this cause are angers,
dejections, and continual tumults; because when God hath shown us a
life without sorrow, the life of virtue, we leave this and mark out
another way, the way of riches and money, full of infinite evils.
And we do the same, as if one, not knowing how to discern the
beauty of men’s bodies but attributing the whole to the clothes
and the ornaments worn, when he saw a handsome woman and possessed
of natural beauty, should pass quickly by her, but when he beheld
one ugly, ill-shaped, and deformed, but clothed in beautiful
garments, should take her for his wife. Now also in some such way
are the multitude affected about virtue and vice. They admit the
one that is deformed by nature on account of her external
ornaments, but turn away from her that is fair and lovely, on
account of her unadorned beauty, for which cause they ought
especially to choose her.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxx-p73">[9.] Therefore am I ashamed that among the foolish
heathen there are those that practise this philosophy, if not in
deeds, yet so far at least as judgment goes; and who know the
perishable nature of things present: whereas amongst us some do
not even understand these things, but have their very judgment
corrupted: and this while the Scripture is ever and anon sounding
in our ears, and saying, “In his sight the vile person is
contemned, but he honoreth them that fear the Lord: (<scripRef passage="Ps. xv. 4" id="iv.xxx-p73.1" parsed="|Ps|15|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.15.4">Ps. xv. 4</scripRef>.) the fear of the Lord

things though we hear every day, we are yet nailed to earth. And
as ignorant children, who learn their letters continuously, if they
be examined concerning their order when they are disarranged,
naming one instead of another, make much laughter: so also ye,
when here we recount them in order, follow us in a manner; but when
we ask you out of doors and in no set order, what we ought to place
first and what next among things, and which after which; not
knowing how to answer, ye become ridiculous. Is it not a matter
of great laughter, tell me, that they who expect immortality and
the good “things which eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither
have entered into the heart of man,” should strive about things
which linger here and count them enviable? For if thou hast need
yet to learn these things that riches are no great thing, that
things present are a shadow and a dream, that like smoke they are
dissolved and fly away: stand for the present without the
sanctuary: abide in the vestibule: since thou art not yet
worthy of the entrance to the palace-courts on high. For if thou
knowest not to discern their nature which is unstable and
continually passing away, when wilt thou be able to despise
them?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxx-p75">But if thou say thou knowest, cease curiously to
inquire and busy thyself, what can be the reason why such an one is
rich and such an one poor: for thou doest the same when thou
askest these questions, as if thou didst go round and enquire, why
one is fair and another black, or one hook-nosed and another
flat-nosed. For as these things make no difference to us, whether
it be thus or thus; so neither poverty nor riches, and much less
than they. But the whole depends upon the way in which we use
them. Whether thou art poor, thou mayest live cheerfully denying
thyself; or rich, thou art most miserable of all men if thou fliest
from virtue. For these are what really concern us, the things of
virtue. And if these things be not added, the rest are useless.
For this cause also are those continual questions, because the most
think that indifferent things are of importance 
<pb n="175" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_175.html" id="iv.xxx-Page_175" />to them, but of the important things they make no
account: since that which is of importance to us is virtue and
love of wisdom.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxx-p76">Because then ye stand I know not where, at some far
distance from her, therefore is there confusion of thoughts,
therefore the many waves, therefore the tempest. For when men
have fallen from heavenly glory and the love of heaven, they desire
present glory and become slaves and captives. “And how is it
that we desire this,” say you? From the not greatly desiring
that. And this very thing, whence happens it? From
negligence. And whence the negligence? From contempt. And
whence the contempt? From folly and cleaving to things present
and unwillingness to investigate accurately the nature of things.
And whence again doth this latter arise? From the neither giving
heed to the reading of the Scripture nor conversing with holy men,
and from following the assemblies of the wicked.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxx-p77">That this therefore may not always be so, and lest
wave after wave receiving us should carry us out into the deep of
miseries and altogether drown and destroy us; while there is time,
let us bear up and standing upon the rock, I mean of the divine
doctrines and words, let us look down upon the surge of this
present life. For thus shall we both ourselves escape the same,
and having drawn up others who are making shipwreck, we shall
obtain the blessings which are to come, through the grace and
mercy, &amp;c.</p>

the considerations that the thing given was of free favor; that
they received all from “one and the self-same Spirit;” that it
was given “to profit withal,” that even by the lesser gifts a
manifestation was made; and withal having also stopped their mouth
from the duty of yielding to the authority of the Spirit: (“for
all these,” saith he, “worketh the one and the same Spirit,
dividing to each one severally even as he will;” wherefore it is
not right to be over-curious:)  he proceeds now to soothe them in
like manner from another common example, and betakes himself to
nature itself, as was his use to do.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxi-p5">For when he was discoursing about the hair of men
and women, after all the rest he drew matter thence also to correct
them, saying, “Doth not even nature itself teach you that if a
man have long hair, it is a dishonor to him? but if a woman have
long hair, it is a glory to her?” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. xi. 14, 15" id="iv.xxxi-p5.1" parsed="|1Cor|11|14|11|15" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.11.14-1Cor.11.15">1 Cor. xi. 14, 15</scripRef>.) And when he spake
concerning the idol-sacrifices, forbidding to touch them, he drew
an argument from the examples also of them that are without, both
making mention of the Olympic games, where he saith, “they which
run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize:” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. ix. 24" id="iv.xxxi-p5.2" parsed="|1Cor|9|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.9.24">1 Cor. ix. 24</scripRef>.) and confirming these views
from shepherds and soldiers and husbandmen. Wherefore he brings
forward here also a common example by which he presses on and
fights hard to prove that no one was really put in a worse
condition: a thing which was marvellous and surprising to be able
to show, and calculated to refresh the weaker sort, I mean, the
example of the body. For nothing so consoles the person of small
spirit and inferior gifts, or so persuades him not to grieve, as
the being convinced that he is not left with less than his share.
Wherefore also Paul making out this point, thus expresses
himself: “for as the body is one and hath many members.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxi-p6">Seest thou his exact consideration? He is pointing
out the same thing to be both one and many. Wherefore also he
adds, pressing the point more vigorously, “and all the members of
the one body, being many, are one body.” He said not, “being
many, are of one body,” but “the one body itself is many:”
and those many members are this one thing. If therefore the one
is many, and the many are one, where is the difference? where the
superiority? where the disadvantage? For all, saith he, are
one: and not simply one, but being strictly considered in respect
of that even which is principal, i.e., their being a body, they are
found all to be one: but when considered as to their particular
natures, then the difference comes out, and the difference is in
all alike. For none of them by itself can make a body, but each
is alike deficient in the making a body, and there is need of a
coming together since when the many become one, then and not till
then is there one <pb n="176" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_176.html" id="iv.xxxi-Page_176" />body.
Wherefore also covertly intimating this very thing, he said, “And
all the members of the one body, being many, are one body.” And
he said not, “the superior and the inferior,” but “being
many,” which is common to all.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxi-p7">And how is it possible that they should be one? 
When throwing out the difference of the members, thou considerest
the body. For the same thing which the eye is, this also is the
foot in regard of its being a member and constituting a body. For
there is no difference in this respect. Nor canst thou say that
one of the members makes a body of itself, but another does not.
For they are all equal in this, for the very reason that they are
all one body.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxi-p8">But having said this and having shown it
clearly from the common judgment of all, he added, “so also is
Christ.” And when he should have said, “so also is the
Church,” for this was the natural consequent he doth not say it
but instead of it places the name of Christ, carrying the discourse
up on high and appealing more and more to the hearer’s
reverence. But his meaning is this: “So also is the body of
Christ, which is the Church.” For as the body and the head<note place="end" n="178" id="iv.xxxi-p8.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxi-p9"> [The author seems here to imply that the Apostle
speaks of Christ simply as the head of the church, the same view
which Meyer advocates. It is better to consider the expression as
denoting the analogy of the body to Christ, since it is one body
yet has many members. Christ is the personal subject, the
“Ego” whose body is the church. “Christus non localiter,
sed mystice et virtualiter, sive operative et per efficentiam, est
corpus, hypostasis, anima et spiritus totius Ecclesiæ.” (Cor.
a Lap.) Principal Edwards says that the Apostle’s meaning if
expressed in modern phrase would run thus: “As the Person is
one while the members of his body are many, so also Christ is one
but the members of his mystical body, the church, are many.”
C.]</p></note> are one man,
so he said that the Church and Christ are one. Wherefore also he
placed Christ instead of the Church, giving that name to His
body. “As then,” saith he, “our body is one thing though it
be composed of many: so also in the Church we all are one
thing. For though the Church be composed of many members, yet
these many form one body.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxi-p10">[2.] Thus having, you see, recovered and raised up
by this common example him who thought himself depreciated, again
he leaves the topic of common experience, and comes to another, a
spiritual one, bringing greater consolation and indicative of great
equality of honor. What then is this?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxi-p11"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 12.13" id="iv.xxxi-p11.1" parsed="|1Cor|12|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.12.13">Ver. 13</scripRef>. “For in one Spirit, saith
he, were we all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks,
whether bond or free.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxi-p12">Now his meaning is this: that which
established us to become one body and regenerated us, is one
Spirit: for not in one Spirit was one baptized, and another
another. And not only is that which hath baptized us one, but
also that unto which<note place="end" n="179" id="iv.xxxi-p12.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxi-p13"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxxi-p13.1">εἰς ὃ</span>—<span class="Greek" id="iv.xxxi-p13.2">ἐφ̓ ᾧ</span>.</p></note> He baptized us, i.e., for which<note place="end" n="180" id="iv.xxxi-p13.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxi-p14"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxxi-p14.1">εἰς ὃ</span>—<span class="Greek" id="iv.xxxi-p14.2">ἐφ̓ ᾧ</span>.</p></note> He baptized
us, is one. For we were baptized not that so many several bodies
might be formed, but that we might all preserve one with another
the perfect nature of one body: i.e., that we might all be one
body, into the same were we baptized.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxi-p15">So that both He who formed it is one, and that
into which He formed it is one. And he said not, “that we might
all come to be of the same body;” but, “that we might all be
one body.” For he ever strives to use the more expressive
phrases. And well said he, “we all,” adding also himself.
“For not even I, the Apostle, have any more than thou in this
respect,” saith he. “For thou art the body even as I, and I
even as thou, and we have all the same Head and have passed
through<note place="end" n="181" id="iv.xxxi-p15.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxi-p16"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxxi-p16.1">ἐ</span><span class="Greek" id="iv.xxxi-p16.2">λύσαμεν</span>.</p></note> the same
birth-pains. Wherefore we are also the same body.” “And why
speak I,” saith he, “of the Jews? since even the Gentiles who
were so far off from us, He hath brought into the entireness of one
body.” Wherefore having said, “we all,” he stopped not
here, but added, “whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond or
free.” Now if, having before been so far off, we were united
and have become one, much more after that we have become one, we
can have no right to grieve and be dejected. Yea, the difference,
in fact, hath no place. For if to Greeks and Jews, to bond and
free, He hath vouchsafed the same blessings, how can it be that
after so vouchsafing He divides them, now that He hath bestowed a
greater perfection of unity by the supply of His gifts?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxi-p17">“And were all made to drink of one Spirit.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxi-p18"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 12.14" id="iv.xxxi-p18.1" parsed="|1Cor|12|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.12.14">Ver. 14</scripRef>. “For the body is not one
member, but many.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxi-p19">i.e., We are come to the same initiation, we enjoy
the same Table. And why said he not, “we are nourished by the
same body and drink the same blood?” Because by saying
“Spirit,” he declared them both, as well the flesh as the
blood. For through both are we “made to drink of the
Spirit.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxi-p20">But to me he appears now to speak of that visitation
of the Spirit which takes place in us after Baptism and before the
Mysteries. And he said, “We were made to drink,” because this
metaphorical speech suited him extremely well for his proposed
subject: as if he had said respecting plants and a garden, that
by the same fountain all the trees are watered, or by the same
water; so also here, “we all drank the same Spirit, we enjoyed
the same grace,” saith he.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxi-p21">If now one Spirit both formed us and gathered us all
together into one body; for this is the meaning of, “we were
baptized into one body:” and vouchsafed us one table, and gave
us all the same watering, (for this is the mean<pb n="177" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_177.html" id="iv.xxxi-Page_177" />ing of, “we were made to
drink into one Spirit<note place="end" n="182" id="iv.xxxi-p21.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxi-p22"> [The phrase here “drink into one Spirit”
differs from that used in the citation above, where we read
“drink of one Spirit.” The difference exists in the Greek
original. Chrysostom quotes what is now considered to be the
correct text, omitting the preposition, but writes afterward,
inserting it. There is unusual obscurity in his treatment of the
passage. He expressly excludes any reference to the sacraments,
saying it is “after baptism and before the mysteries,” (i.e.
the Lord’s Supper), and then speaks of it as if it meant a
watering of plants, which however is not natural. Most
interpreters refer it baptism. C.]</p></note>,”) and united persons so widely
separated; and if many things then become a body when they are made
one: why, I pray, art thou continually tossing to and from their
difference? But if thou sayest, “Because there are many members
and diverse,” know that this very thing is the wonder and the
peculiar excellency of the body, when the things which are many and
diverse make one. But if they were not many, it were not so
wonderful and incredible that they should be one body; nay, rather
they would not be a body at all.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxi-p23">[3.] This however he states last; but for the
present he goes to the members themselves, saying thus:</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxi-p24"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 12.15" id="iv.xxxi-p24.1" parsed="|1Cor|12|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.12.15">Ver. 15</scripRef>.
“If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of
the body; is it therefore not of the body?”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxi-p25"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 12.16" id="iv.xxxi-p25.1" parsed="|1Cor|12|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.12.16">Ver. 16</scripRef>. “And if the ear shall
say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it
therefore not of the body?”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxi-p26">For if the one being made inferior and the other
superior, doth not allow their being of the body, the whole is done
away. Do not say therefore, “I am not the body, because I am
inferior.” For the foot also hath the inferior post, yet is it
of the body: for the being or not being part of the body, is not
from the one lying in this place and the other in that; (which is
what constitutes difference of place;) but from the being conjoined
or separated. For the being or not being a body, arises from the
having been made one or not. But do thou, I pray, mark his
considerate way, how he applies their words to our members. For
as he said above, “These things have I in a figure transferred to
myself and Apollos,” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. iv. 6" id="iv.xxxi-p26.1" parsed="|1Cor|4|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.4.6">1
Cor. iv. 6</scripRef>.) just so
likewise here, to make his argument free from invidiousness and
acceptable, he introduces the members speaking: that when they
shall hear nature answering them, being thus convicted by
experience herself and by the general voice, they may have nothing
further to oppose. “For say, if you will,” saith he, “this
very thing, murmur as you please, you cannot be out of the body.
For as the law of nature, so much more doth the power of grace
guard all things and preserve them entire.” And see how he kept
to the rule of having nothing superfluous; not working out his
argument on all the members, but on two only and these the
extremes; having specified both the most honorable of all, the eye,
and the meanest of all, the feet. And he doth not make the foot
to discourse with the eye, but with the hand which is mounted a
little above it; and the ear with the eyes. For because we are
wont to envy not those who are very far above us, but those who are
a little higher, therefore he also conducts his comparison
thus.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxi-p27"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 12.17" id="iv.xxxi-p27.1" parsed="|1Cor|12|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.12.17">Ver. 17</scripRef>. “If the whole body were
an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where
were the smelling?”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxi-p28">Thus, because, having fallen upon the difference of
the members, and having mentioned feet, and hands, and eyes, and
ears, he led them to the consideration of their own inferiority and
superiority: see how again he consoles them, intimating that so
it was expedient: and that their being many and diverse, this
especially causeth them to be a body. But if they all were some
one, they would not be a body. Wherefore, he saith, “If they
were all one member, where were the body?” This however, he
mentions not till afterwards; but here he points out also something
more; that besides the impossibility of any one being a body, it
even takes away the being of the rest.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxi-p29">“For if the whole were hearing, where were the
smelling,” saith he.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxi-p30">[4.] Then because after all they were yet
disturbed: that which he had done above, the same he doth also
now. For as there he first alleged the expediency to comfort them
and afterwards stopped their mouths, vehemently saying, “But all
these worketh the one and the same Spirit, dividing to each one man
severally even as He will:” so also here having stated reasons
for which he showed that it was profitable that all should so be,
he refers the whole again to the counsel of God, saying,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxi-p31"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 12.18" id="iv.xxxi-p31.1" parsed="|1Cor|12|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.12.18">Ver. 18</scripRef>. “But now God hath set the
members each one of them in the body, even as it pleased
Him.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxi-p32">Even as he said of the Spirit, “as He will,” so
also here, “as it pleased Him.” Now do not thou seek further
into the cause, why it is thus and why not thus. For though we
have ten thousand reasons to give, we shall not be so able to show
them that it is well done, as when we say, that as the best
Artificer pleased, so it came to pass. For as it is expedient, so
He wills it. Now if in this body of ours we do not curiously
enquire about the members, much more in the Church. And see his
thoughtfulness in that he doth not state the difference which
arises from their nature nor that from their operation, but that
from their local situation. For “now,” saith he, “God hath
set the members each one of them in the body even as it pleased
Him.” And he said well, “each one,” pointing out that the
use extends to all. For thou canst not say, “This He hath
Himself placed but not that: 
<pb n="178" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_178.html" id="iv.xxxi-Page_178" />but every one according to His will, so it is
situated.” So that to the foot also it is profitable that it
should be so stationed, and not to the head only: and if it
should invert the order and leaving its own place, should go to
another, though it might seem to have bettered its condition, it
would be the undoing and ruin of the whole. For it both falls
from its own, and reaches not the other station.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxi-p33">[5.] <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 12.19" id="iv.xxxi-p33.1" parsed="|1Cor|12|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.12.19">Ver. 19</scripRef>. “And if they were all one

members, but one body.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxi-p34">Thus having silenced them sufficiently by God’s
own arrangement, again he states reasons. And he neither doth
this always nor that, but alternates and varies his discourse.
Since on the one hand, he who merely silences, confounds the
hearer, and he, on the contrary, who accustoms him to demand
reasons for all things, injures him in the matter of faith; for
this cause then Paul is continually practising both the one and the
other, that they may both believe and may not be confounded; and
after silencing them, he again gives a reason likewise. And mark
his earnestness in the combat and the completeness of his
victory. For from what things they supposed themselves unequal in
honor because in them there was great diversity, even from these
things he shows that for this very reason they are equal in
honor. How, I will tell you.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxi-p35">“If all were one member,” saith he, “where
were the body?”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxi-p36">Now what he means is, If there were not among you
great diversity, ye could not be a body; and not being a body, ye
could not be one; and not being one, ye could not be equal in
honor. Whence it follows again that if ye were all equal in
honor, ye were not a body; and not being a body, ye were not one;
and not being one, how could ye be equal in honor? As it is,
however, because ye are not all endowed with some one gift,
therefore are ye a body; and being a body, ye are all one, and
differ nothing from one another in this that ye are a body. So
that this very difference is that which chiefly causeth your
equality in honor. And accordingly he adds, “But now they are
many members, yet one body.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxi-p37">[6.] These things then let us also consider
and cast out all envy, and neither grudge against them that have
greater gifts nor despise them that possess the lesser. For thus
had God willed: let us then not oppose ourselves. But if thou
art still disturbed, consider that thy work is oft-times such as
thy brother is unable to perform. So that even if thou art
inferior, yet in this thou hast the advantage: and though he be
greater, he is worse off in this respect; and so equality takes
place. For in the body even the little members seem to contribute
no little, but the great ones themselves are often injured by them,
I mean by their removal. Thus what in the body is more
insignificant than the hair? Yet if thou shouldest remove this,
insignificant as it is, from the eyebrows and the eyelids, thou
hast destroyed all the grace of the countenance, and the eye will
no longer appear equally beautiful. And yet the loss is of a
trifle; but notwithstanding even thus all the comeliness is
destroyed. And not the comeliness only, but much also of the use
of the eyes. The reason is that every one of our members hath
both a working of its own and one which is common; and likewise
there is in us a beauty which is peculiar and another which is
common. And these kinds of beauty appear indeed to be divided,
but they are perfectly bound together, and when one is destroyed,
the other perishes also along with it. To explain myself: let
there be bright eyes, and a smiling cheek, and a red lip, and
straight nose, and open brow; nevertheless, if thou mar but the
slightest of these, thou hast marred the common beauty of all; all
is full of dejection; all will appear foul to look on, which before
was so beautiful: thus if thou shouldest crush only the tip of
the nose thou hast brought great deformity upon all: and yet it
is the maiming of but a single member. And likewise in the hand,
if thou shouldest take away the nail from one finger, thou wouldest
see the same result. If now thou wouldest see the same taking
place in respect of their function<note place="end" n="183" id="iv.xxxi-p37.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxi-p38"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxxi-p38.1">ἐπὶ
ἐνεργείας</span>.</p></note> also, take away one finger, and
thou wilt see the rest less active and no longer performing their
part equally.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxi-p39">Since then the loss of a member is a common
deformity, and its safety beauty to all, let us not be lifted up
nor trample on our neighbors. For through that small member even
the great one is fair and beautiful, and by the eyelids, slight as
they are, is the eye adorned. So that he who wars with his
brother wars with himself: for the injury done reaches not only
unto that one, but himself also shall undergo no small loss.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxi-p40">[7.] That this then may not be, let us care
for our neighbors as for ourselves, and let us transfer this image
of the body now also to the Church, and be careful for all as for
our own members. For in the Church there are members many and
diverse: and some are more honorable and some more deficient.
For example, there are choirs of virgins, there are assemblies of
widows, there are fraternities<note place="end" n="184" id="iv.xxxi-p40.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxi-p41"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxxi-p41.1">φρατρίαι</span>.</p></note> of those who shine in holy
wedlock<note place="end" n="185" id="iv.xxxi-p41.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxi-p42"> See Bingham, vii. 2. 6; and as quoted by him,
S. Athanas, <i>ad Dracont</i>, t. i. p. 263; S. Augustin. <i>de
Hæres</i>. c. 40; in support of the opinion, that “there was an
order of monks which lived in a married state, and enjoyed their
own property and possessions as the primitive ascetics were used to
do.” If the opinion is correct, (the places quoted seem hardly
to prove it,) this place of St. Chrysostom may perhaps refer to
that order.</p></note>; in short,
many are the 
<pb n="179" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_179.html" id="iv.xxxi-Page_179" />degrees of virtue. And in almsgiving
again in like manner. For some empty themselves of all their
goods: others care for a competency alone and seek nothing more
than necessaries; others give of their superfluity: nevertheless,
all these adorn one another; and if the greater should set at
nought the less, he would in the greatest degree injure himself.
Thus, suppose a virgin to deal scornfully with a married woman, she
hath cut off no small part of her reward; and he again that emptied
himself of all should he upbraid him that hath not done so, hath
emptied himself of much of the fruit of his labors. And why speak
I of virgins, and widows, and men without possessions? What is
meaner than those who beg? and yet even these fulfill a most
important office in the Church, clinging to the doors of the
sanctuary<note place="end" n="186" id="iv.xxxi-p42.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxi-p43"> Bingham, iv. 4. 1. “At the entrance of the
interior Narthex,” or Choir, “the Poor of the Church placed
themselves, both before and after Divine Service, to ask alms of
such as came from the Altar.” S. Chrys. on 1 Thess. Hom. xi.
near the end, “In the Churches, and in the Chapels of the
Martyrs, the poor sit in front of the vestibules…When we enter
into earthly palaces, there is no such thing to be seen, but grave,
splendid, rich, wise men are hastening about on all sides. But at
our entrance into the true palaces, the Church, and the houses of
prayer of the Martyrs, there are possessed persons, maimed, poor,
old, blind, distorted in their limbs.” “They are an admirable
sort of watch-dogs, keeping guard in the Courts of the Palace.
Feed them therefore, for the honor redounds to their king…That
human things are nought, thou art excellently instructed by the
very Porch of the Church: that God delights not in wealth, thou
art taught by those who sit before Him.” For the custom of the
Church of Rome, see the account of St. Lawrence’s martyrdom in
Prudentius, as quoted by Hooker, E. P. V. lxxix. 14.</p></note> and
supplying one of its greatest ornaments: and without these there
could be no perfecting the fulness of the Church. Which thing, as
it seems, the Apostles also observing made a law from the
beginning, as in regard to all other things, so also that there
should be widows: and so great care did they use about the matter
as also to set over them seven deacons. For as bishops and
presbyters and deacons and virgins and continent persons, enter
into my enumeration, where I am reckoning up the members of the
Church, so also do widows. Yea, and it is no mean office which
they fill. For thou indeed comest here when thou wilt: but
these both day and night sing psalms and attend: not for alms
only doing this; since if that were their object, they might walk
in the market place and beg in the alleys: but there is in them
piety also in no small degree. At least, behold in what a furnace
of poverty they are; yet never shalt thou hear a blasphemous word
from them nor an impatient one, after the manner of many rich
men’s wives. Yet some of them often lie down to their rest in
hunger, and others continue constantly frozen by the cold;
nevertheless, they pass their time in thanksgiving and giving
glory. Though you give but a penny, they give thanks and implore
ten thousand blessings on the giver; and if thou give nothing they
do not complain, but even so they bless, and think themselves happy
to enjoy their daily food.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxi-p44">“Yes,” it is replied, “since whether
they will or no, they must bear it.” Why, tell me? Wherefore
hast thou uttered this bitter expression? Are there not shameful
arts which bring gain to the aged, both men and women? Had they
not power to support themselves by those means in great abundance,
provided they had chosen to cast off all care of upright living? 
Seest thou not how many persons of that age, by becoming pimps and
panders and by other such ministrations, both live, and live in
luxury<note place="end" n="187" id="iv.xxxi-p44.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxi-p45"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxxi-p45.1">τρέφονται καὶ

these, but they choose rather to perish of hunger than to dishonor
their own life and betray their salvation; and they sit throughout
the whole day, preparing a medicine of salvation for
thee.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxi-p46">For no physician stretching out the hand to apply
the knife, works so effectually to cut out the corruption from our
wounds, as doth a poor man stretching out his right hand and
receiving alms, to take away the scars which the wounds have
left. And what is truly wonderful, they perform this excellent
chirurgery without pain and anguish: and we who are set over the
people and give you so much wholesome advice, do not more truly
discourse than he doth, who sits before the doors of the church, by
his silence and his countenance. For we too sound these things in
your ears every day, saying, “Be not high-minded, O man; human
nature is a thing that soon declines and is ready to fall away; our
youth hastens on to old age, our beauty to deformity, our strength
to weakness, our honor to contempt, our health falls away to
sickness, our glory to meanness, our riches to poverty; our
concerns are like a violent current that never will stand still,
but keeps hastening down the steep.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxi-p47">The same advice do they also give and more than
this, by their appearance and by their experience itself too, which
is a yet plainer kind of advice. How many, for instance, of those
who now sit without, were in the bloom of youth and did great
things? How many of these loathsome looking persons surpassed
many, both in vigor of body and in beauty of countenance? Nay,
disbelieve it not nor deride. For surely, life is full of ten
thousand such examples. For if from mean and humble persons many
have oftentimes become kings, what marvel is it if from being great
and glorious, some have been made humble and mean? Since the
former is much the more extraordinary: but the latter, of
perpetual occurrence. So that one ought not to be incredulous
that any of them ever flourished in arts, and arms, and abundance
of wealth, but rather to pity them with great compassion and to
fear for ourselves, lest we too should sometime suffer the same
things. For <pb n="180" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_180.html" id="iv.xxxi-Page_180" />we too are men
and are subject to this speedy change.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxi-p48">[8.] But perchance some one of the
thoughtless, and of those who are accustomed to scoff, will object
to what hath been said, and will altogether deride us, saying,
“How long wilt thou not cease continually introducing poor men
and beggars in thy discourses, and prophesying to us of
misfortunes, and denouncing poverty to come, and desiring to make
us beggars?” Not from a desire to make beggars of you, O man,
do I say these things, but hastening to open unto you the riches of
heaven. Since he too, who to the healthy man makes mention of the
sick and relates their anguish, saith it not to make him diseased,
but to preserve him in health, by the fear of their calamities
cutting off his remissness. Poverty seems to you to be a fearful
thing and to be dreaded, even to the mere name of it. Yea, and
therefore are we poor, because we are afraid of poverty; though we
have ten thousand talents. For not he who hath nothing is poor,
but he who shudders at poverty. Since in men’s calamities also
it is not those who suffer great evils whom we lament and account
wretched, but those who know not how to bear them, even though they
be small. Whereas he that knows how to bear them is, as all know,
worthy of praises and crowns. And to prove that this is so, whom
do we applaud in the games? Those who are much beaten and do not
vex themselves, but hold their head on high; or those who fly after
the first strokes? Are not those even crowned by us as manly and
noble; while we laugh at these as unmanly and cowards? So then
let us do in the affairs of life. Him that bears all easily let
us crown, as we do that noble champion<note place="end" n="188" id="iv.xxxi-p48.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxi-p49"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxxi-p49.1">παγκρατιαστήν</span>.</p></note>; but weep over him that shrinks and
trembles at his dangers, and who before he receives the blow is
dead with fear. For so in the games; if any before he raised his
hands, at the mere sight of his adversary extending his right hand,
should fly, though he receive no wound, he will be laughed to scorn
as feeble and effeminate and unversed in such struggles. Now this
is like what happens to these who fear poverty, and cannot so much
as endure the expectation of it.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxi-p50">Evidently then it is not we that make you
wretched, but ye yourselves. For how can it be that the devil
should not hence-forth make sport of thee, seeing thee even before
the stroke afraid and trembling at the menace? Or rather, when
thou dost but esteem this a threat, he will have no need so much as
to strike thee any more, but leaving thee to keep thy wealth, by
the expectation of its being taken away he will render thee softer
than any wax. And because it is our nature (so to speak,) not to
consider the objects of our dread so fearful after suffering, as
before and while yet untried: therefore to prevent thee from
acquiring even this virtue, he detains thee in the very height of
fear; by the fear of poverty, before all experience of it, melting
thee down as wax in the fire. Yea, and such a man is softer than
any wax and lives a life more wretched than Cain himself. For the
things which he hath in excess, he is in fear: for those which he
hath not, in grief; and again, concerning what he hath he trembles,
keeping his wealth within as a wilful runaway slave, and beset by I
know not what various and unaccountable passions. For
unaccountable desire, and manifold fear and anxiety, and trembling
on every side, agitate them. And they are like a vessel driven by
contrary winds from every quarter, and enduring many heavy seas.
And how much better for such a man to depart than to be enduring a
continual storm? Since for Cain also it were more tolerable to
have died than to be for ever trembling<note place="end" n="189" id="iv.xxxi-p50.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxi-p51"> <scripRef passage="Gen. iv. 12" id="iv.xxxi-p51.1" parsed="|Gen|4|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.4.12">Gen. iv.

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxi-p52">Lest we then for our part suffer these things, let
us laugh to scorn the device of the devil, let us burst his cords
asunder, let us sever the point of his terrible spear and fortify
every approach. For if thou laugh at money, he hath not where to

up the root of evils; and when the root is no more, neither will
any evil fruit grow.</p>

never leave off saying them: but whether our sayings do any good,
the day will declare, even that day which is revealed by fire,
which trieth every man’s work, (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. iii. 13" id="iv.xxxi-p53.1" parsed="|1Cor|3|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.3.13">1 Cor. iii. 13</scripRef>.) which showeth what lamps are

<p class="c27" id="iv.xxxii-p3">And the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need
of thee: or again the head to the feet, I have no need of
you.</p>

<p class="c24" id="iv.xxxii-p4"><span class="c18" id="iv.xxxii-p4.1">Having</span> checked the envy of
those in lower rank, and having taken off the dejection which it
was likely that they would feel from greater gifts having been
vouchsafed to others, he humbles also the pride of these latter who
had received the greater gifts. He had done the same indeed in
his discourse also with the former. For the statement that it was
a gift and not an achievement was intended to declare this. But
now he doth it again even more vehemently, dwelling on the same
image. For from the body in what follows, and from the unity
thence arising, he proceeds to the actual comparison of the
members, a thing on which they were especially seeking to be
instructed. Since there was not so much power to console them in
the circumstance of their being all one body, as in the conviction
that in the very things wherewith they were endowed, they were not
left greatly behind. And he saith, “The eye cannot say to the
hand, I have no need of thee: or again the head to the feet, I
have no need of you.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxii-p5">For though the gift be less, yet is it necessary: 
and as when the one is absent, many functions are impeded, so also
without the other there is a maim in the fulness of the Church.
And he said not, “will not say,” but “cannot say.” So
that even though it wish it, though it should actually say so, it
is out of the question nor is the thing consistent with nature.
For this cause having taken the two extremes, he makes trial of his
argument in them, first in respect of the hand and the eye, and
secondly, in respect of the head and feet, adding force to the
example.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxii-p6">For what is meaner than the foot? Or what more
honorable and more necessary than the head? For this, the head,
more than any thing, is the man. Nevertheless, it is not of
itself sufficient nor could it alone perform all things; since if
this were so, our feet would be a superfluous addition.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxii-p7">[2.] And neither did he stop here, but seeks also
another amplification, a kind of thing which he is always doing,
contending not only to be on equal terms but even advancing
beyond. Wherefore also he adds, saying,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxii-p8"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 12.22" id="iv.xxxii-p8.1" parsed="|1Cor|12|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.12.22">Ver. 22</scripRef>. “Nay, much rather those

body which we think to be less honorable, upon these we bestow more
abundant honor; and our uncomely parts have more abundant
comeliness.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxii-p10">In every clause adding the term “body,”
and thereby both consoling the one and checking the other. “For
I affirm not this only,<note place="end" n="190" id="iv.xxxii-p10.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxii-p11"> The Text of the Editions seems here slightly
corrupt. The word <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxxii-p11.1">μόνον</span> apparently
should be transposed, and the second negative omitted.</p></note>” saith he, “that the greater
have need of the less, but that they have also much need. Since
if there be any thing weak in us, if any thing dishonorable, this
is both necessary and enjoys greater honor.” And he well said,
“which seem,” and, “which we think;” pointing out that the
judgment arises not from the nature of the things, but from the
opinion of the many. For nothing in us is dishonorable, seeing it
is God’s work. Thus what in us is esteemed less honorable than
our genital members? Nevertheless, they enjoy greater honor.
And the very poor, even if they have the rest of the body naked,
cannot endure to exhibit those members naked. Yet surely this is
not the condition of things dishonorable; but it was natural for
them to be despised rather than the rest. For so in a house the
servant who is dishonored, so far from enjoying greater attention,
hath not even an equal share vouchsafed him. By the same rule
likewise, if this member were dishonorable, instead of having
greater privileges it ought not even to enjoy the same: whereas
now it hath more honor for its portion: and this too the wisdom
of God hath effected. For to some parts by their nature He hath
given not to need it: but to others, not having granted it by
their nature, He hath compelled us to yield it. Yet are they not
therefore dishonorable. Since the animals too by their nature
have a sufficiency, and need neither clothing nor shoes nor a roof,
the greater part <pb n="182" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_182.html" id="iv.xxxii-Page_182" />of
them: yet not on this account is our body less honorable than
they, because it needs all these things.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxii-p12">Yea rather, were one to consider accurately,
these parts in question are even by nature itself both honorable
and necessary. Which in truth Paul himself imitated, giving his
judgment<note place="end" n="191" id="iv.xxxii-p12.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxii-p13"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxxii-p13.1">ψηφισάμενος</span>.</p></note> in their
favor not from our care and from their enjoying greater honor, but
from the very nature of the things.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxii-p14">Wherefore when he calls them “weak” and “less
honorable,” he uses the expression, “which seem:” but when
he calls them “necessary,” he no longer adds “which seem,”
but himself gives his judgment, saying, “they are necessary;”
and very properly. For they are useful to procreation of children
and the succession of our race. Wherefore also the Roman
legislators punish them that mutilate these members and make men
eunuchs, as persons who do injury to our common stock and affront
nature herself.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxii-p15">But woe to the dissolute who bring reproach on the
handy-works of God. For as many are wont to curse wine on account
of the drunken, and womankind on account of the unchaste; so also
they account these members base because of those who use them not
as they ought. But improperly. For the sin is not allotted to
the thing as a portion of its nature, but the transgression is
produced by the will of him that ventures on it.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxii-p16">But some suppose that the expressions, “the feeble
members,” and “less honorable,” and “necessary,” and
“which enjoy more abundant honor,” are used by Paul of eyes and
feet, and that he speaks of the eye as “more feeble,” and
“necessary,” because though deficient in strength, they have
the advantage in utility: but of the feet as the “less
honorable:” for these also receive from us great
consideration.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxii-p17">[3.] Next, not to work out yet another
amplification, he says,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxii-p18"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 12.24" id="iv.xxxii-p18.1" parsed="|1Cor|12|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.12.24">Ver. 24</scripRef>. “But our comely parts
have no need:”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxii-p19">That is, lest any should say, “Why what kind of
speech is this, to despise the honorable and pay court to the less
honored?” “we do not this in contempt,” saith he, “but
because they ‘have no need.’” And see how large a measure
of praise he thus sets down in brief, and so hastens on: a thing
most conveniently and usefully done. And neither is he content
with this, but adds also the cause, saying, “But God tempered the
body together, giving more abundant honor unto that part which
lacked:”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxii-p20"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 12.25" id="iv.xxxii-p20.1" parsed="|1Cor|12|25|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.12.25">Ver. 25</scripRef>. “That there should be no
schism in the body.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxii-p21">Now if He tempered it together, He did not suffer
that which is more uncomely to appear. For that which is mingled
becomes one thing, and it doth not appear what it was before: 
since otherwise we could not say that it was tempered. And see
how he continually hastens by the defects, saying, “that which
lacked.” He said not, “to that which is dishonorable,”
“to that which is unseemly,” but, “to that which lacked,
(“that which lacked;” how? by nature,) giving more abundant
honor.” And wherefore? “That there should be no schism in
the body.” Thus because, though they enjoyed an endless store
of consolation, they nevertheless indulged grief as if they had
received less than others, he signifies that they were rather
honored. For his phrase is, “Giving more abundant honor to that
which lacked.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxii-p22">Next he also adds the reason, showing that with a
view to their profit he both caused it to lack and more abundantly
honored it. And what is the reason? “That there should be no
schism,” saith he, “in the body.” (And he said not, “in
the members,” but, “in the body.”)  For there would indeed
be a great and unfair advantage, if some members were cared for
both by nature and by our forethought, others not even by either
one of these. Then would they be cut off from one another, from
inability to endure the connection. And when these were cut off,
there would be harm done also to the rest. Seest thou how he
points out, that of necessity “greater honor” is given to
“that which lacketh?” “For had not this been so, the injury
would have become common to all,” saith he. And the reason is,
that unless these received great consideration on our part, they
would have been rudely treated, as not having the help of nature: 
and this rude treatment would have been their ruin: their ruin
would have divided the body; and the body having been divided, the
other members also would have perished, which are far greater than
these.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxii-p23">Seest thou that the care of these latter is
connected with making provision for those? For they have not
their being so much in their own nature, as in their being one, by
virtue of the body<note place="end" n="192" id="iv.xxxii-p23.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxii-p24"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxxii-p24.1">ὦ</span><span class="Greek" id="iv.xxxii-p24.2">ς ἐν τὧ σώματι εἷναι
ἕν</span>.</p></note>. Wherefore if the body perish,
they profit nothing by such health as they have severally. But if
the eye remain or the nose, preserving its proper function, yet
when the bond of union is broken there will be no use for them ever
after; whereas, suppose this remaining, and those injured, they
both support themselves through it and speedily return to
health.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxii-p25">But perhaps some one may say, “this indeed in the
body hath reason, that ‘that which lacketh hath received more
abundant honor,’ <pb n="183" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_183.html" id="iv.xxxii-Page_183" />but among
men how may this be made out?” Why, among men most especially
thou mayest see this taking place. For so they who came at the
eleventh hour first received their hire; and the sheep that had
wandered induced the shepherd to leave behind the ninety and nine
and run after it, and when it was found, he bore and did not drive
it; and the prodigal son obtained more honor than he who was
approved; and the thief was crowned and proclaimed before the
Apostles. And in the case of the talents also thou mayest see
this happen: in that to him that received the five talents, and
to him that received two, were vouchsafed the same rewards; yea, by
the very circumstance that he received the two, he was the more
favored with great providential care. Since had he been entrusted
with the five, with his want of ability he would have fallen from
the whole: but having received the two and fulfilled his own
duty, he was thought worthy of the same with him that had gained
the five, having so far the advantage, as with less labor to obtain
the same crown. And yet he too was a man as well as the one that
traded with the five. Nevertheless, his Master doth not in any
wise call him to a strict account, nor compel him to do the same
with his fellow-servant, nor doth he say, “Why canst thou not
gain the five?” (though he might justly have said so,) but
assigned him likewise his crown.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxii-p26">[4.] Knowing these things therefore, ye that are
greater, trample not on the less, lest, instead of them, ye injure
yourselves. For when they are cut off, the whole body is
destroyed. Since, what else is a body than the existence of many
members? As also Paul himself saith, that “the body is not one
member, but many.” If therefore this be the essence of a body,
let us take care that the many continue many. Since, unless this
be entirely preserved, the stroke is in the vital parts; which is
the reason also why the Apostle doth not require this only, their
not being separated, but also their being closely united. For
instance, having said, “that there be no schism in the body,”
he was not content with this, but added, “that the members should
have the same care one for another.” Adding this other cause
also of the less enjoying more honor. For not only lest they
should be separated one from another hath God so contrived it, but
also that there may be abundant love and concord. For if each
man’s being depends on his neighbor’s safety, tell me not of
the less and the more: in this case there is no more and less.
While the body continues you may see the difference too, but when
it perishes, no longer. And perish it will, unless the lesser
parts also continue.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxii-p27">If now even the greater members will perish when the
less are broken off, these ought to care in like manner for the
less, and so as for themselves, inasmuch as in the safety of these
the greater likewise remain. So then, shouldst thou say ten
thousand times, “such member is dishonored and inferior,” still
if thou provide not for it in like manner as for thyself, if thou
neglect it as inferior, the injury will pass on to thyself.
Wherefore he said not only, that “the members should care one for
another,” but he added, “that they should have the same care
one for another,” i.e., in like manner the small should enjoy the
same providential care with great.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxii-p28">Say not then, that such is an ordinary person,
but consider he is a member of that body which holds together the
whole: and as the eye, so also doth he cause the body to be a
body. For where the body is builded up, there none hath anything
more than his neighbor: since neither does this make a body,
there being one part greater and another less, but their being many
and diverse. For even as thou, because thou art greater, didst
help to make up the body, so also he, because he is less. So that
his comparative deficiency, when the body is to be builded up,
turns out of equal value with thee unto this noble contribution<note place="end" n="193" id="iv.xxxii-p28.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxii-p29"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxxii-p29.1">ἔ</span><span class="Greek" id="iv.xxxii-p29.2">ρανον</span>.</p></note>: yea, he
avails as much as thyself. And it is evident from hence. Let
there be no member greater or less, nor more and less honorable: 
but let all be eye or all head: will not the body perish? Every
one sees it. Again, if all be inferior, the same thing will
happen. So that in this respect also the less are proved equal.
Yea, and if one must say something more, the purpose of the less
being less is that the body may remain. So that for thy sake he
is less, in order that thou mayest continue to be great. And here
is the cause of his demanding the same care from all. And having
said, “that the members may have the same care one for
another,” he explains “the same thing” again, by
saying,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxii-p30">[5.] <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 12.26" id="iv.xxxii-p30.1" parsed="|1Cor|12|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.12.26">Ver. 26</scripRef>. “And whether one member
suffereth all the members suffer with it; or one member is honored,
all the members rejoice with it.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxii-p31">“Yea, with no other view,” saith he, “did He
make the care He requires common, establishing unity in so great
diversity, but that of all events there might be complete
communion. Because, if our care for our neighbor be the common
safety, it follows also that our glory and our sadness must be
common.” Three things therefore he here demands: the not
being divided but united in perfection: the having like care for
another: and the considering all that happens common. And as
above he saith, “He hath given more abundant honor to <pb n="184" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_184.html" id="iv.xxxii-Page_184" />that part which lacked,” because it
needeth it; signifying that the very inferiority was become an
introduction to greater honor; so here he equalizes them in respect
of the care also which takes place mutually among them. For
“therefore did he cause them to partake of greater honor,”
saith he, “that they might not meet with less care.” And not
from hence only, but also by all that befalls them, good and
painful, are the members bound to one another. Thus often when a
thorn is fixed in the heel, the whole body feels it and cares for
it: both the back is bent and the belly and thighs are
contracted, and the hands coming forth as guards and servants draw
out what was so fixed, and the head stoops over it, and the eyes
observe it with much care. So that even if the foot hath
inferiority from its inability to ascend, yet by its bringing down
the head it hath an equality, and is favored with the same honor;
and especially whenever the feet are the cause of the head’s
coming down, not by favor but by their claim on it. And thus, if
by being the more honorable it hath an advantage; yet in that,
being so it owes such honor and care to the lesser and likewise
equal sympathy: by this it indicates great equality. Since what
is meaner than the heel? what more honorable than the head? Yet
this member reaches to that, and moves them all together with
itself. Again if anything is the matter with the eyes, all
complain and all are idle: and neither do the feet walk nor the
hands work, nor doth the stomach enjoy its accustomed food; and yet
the affection is of the eyes. Why dost thou cause the stomach to
pine? why keep thy feet still? why bind thy hands? Because they
are tied to the feet, and in an unspeakable manner the whole body
suffers. For if it shared not in the suffering, it would not
endure to partake of the care. Wherefore having said, “that the
members may have the same care one for another,” he added,
“whether one member suffereth, all the members suffer with it; or
one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.” “And
how do they rejoice with it?” say you. The head is crowned, and
the whole man is honored. The mouth speaks, and the eyes laugh
and are delighted. Yet the credit belongs not to the beauty of
the eyes, but to the tongue. Again if the eyes appear beautiful,
the whole woman is embellished: as indeed these also, when a
straight nose and upright neck and other members are praised,
rejoice and appear cheerful: and again they shed tears in great
abundance over their griefs and misfortunes, though themselves
continue uninjured.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxii-p32">[6.] Let us all then, considering these things,
imitate the love of these members; let us not in any wise do the
contrary, trampling on the miseries of our neighbor and envying his
good things. For this is the part of madmen and persons beside
themselves.  Just as he that digs out his own eye hath displayed a
very great proof of senselessness; and he that devours his own hand
exhibits a clear evidence of downright madness.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxii-p33">Now if this be the case with regard to the members,
so likewise, when it happeneth among the brethren, it fastens on us
the reputation of folly and brings on no common mischief. For as
long as he shines, thy comeliness also is apparent and the whole
body is beautified. For not at all doth he confine the beauty to
himself alone, but permits thee also to glory. But if thou
extinguish him, thou bringest a common darkness upon the whole
body, and the misfortune thou causest is common to all the
members: as indeed if thou preservest him in brightness, thou
preservest the bloom of the entire body. For no man saith, “the
eye is beautiful:” but what? “such a woman is beautiful.”
And if it also be praised, it comes after the common encomium. So
likewise it happens in the Church. I mean, if there be any
celebrated persons, the community reaps the good report of it.
For the enemies are not apt to divide the praises, but connect them
together. And if any be brilliant in speech, they do not praise
him alone but likewise the whole Church. For they do not say
only, “such a one is a wonderful man,” but what? “the
Christians have a wonderful teacher:” and so they make the
possession common.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxii-p34">[7.] And now let me ask, do heathens bind
together, and dost thou divide and war with thine own body, and
withstand thine own members? Knowest thou not that this overturns
all? For even a “kingdom,” saith he, “divided against
itself shall not stand.” (S. 
<scripRef passage="Matt. xii. 25" id="iv.xxxii-p34.1" parsed="|Matt|12|25|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.12.25">Matt. xii. 25</scripRef>.)</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxii-p35">But nothing so divides and separates as envy and
jealousy, that grievous disease, and exempt from all pardon, and in
some respect worse than “the root of all evils.” (<scripRef passage="1 Tim. vi. 12" id="iv.xxxii-p35.1" parsed="|1Tim|6|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.6.12">1 Tim. vi. 12</scripRef>.) For the covetous is then
pleased when himself hath received: but the envious is then
pleased, when another hath failed to receive, not when himself hath
received. For he thinks the misfortunes of others a benefit to
himself, rather than prosperity; going about a common enemy of
mankind, and smiting the members of Christ, than which what can be
more akin to madness? A demon is envious, but of men, not of any
demon: but thou being a man enviest men, and withstandest what is
of thine own tribe and family, which not even a demon doth. And
what pardon shalt thou obtain, what excuse? trembling and turning
pale at sight of a brother <pb n="185" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_185.html" id="iv.xxxii-Page_185" />in
prosperity, when thou oughtest to crown thyself and to rejoice and
exult.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxii-p36">If indeed thou wishest to emulate him, I forbid not
that: emulate, but with a view to be like him who is approved: 
not in order to depress him but that thou mayest reach the same
lofty point, that thou mayest display the same excellence. This
is wholesome rivalry, imitation without contention: not to grieve
at the good things of others but to be vexed at our own evils: 
the contrary to which is the result of envy. For neglecting its
own evils, it pines away at the good fortune of other men. And
thus the poor is not so vexed by his own poverty as by the plenty
of his neighbor; than which what can be more grievous? Yea, in
this respect the envious, as I before said, is worse than the
covetous; the one rejoicing at some acquisition of his own, while
the other finds his delight in some one else failing to
receive.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxii-p37">Wherefore I beseech you, leaving this evil way, to
change to a proper emulation, (for it is a violent thing, this kind
of zeal, and hotter than any fire,) and to win thereby mighty
blessings. Thus also Paul used to guide those of Jewish origin
unto the faith, saying, “If by any means I may provoke to
emulation them which are my flesh, and may save some of them.”
(<scripRef passage="Rom. xi. 14" id="iv.xxxii-p37.1" parsed="|Rom|11|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.11.14">Rom. xi. 14</scripRef>.) For he whose emulation is
like what Paul wished for doth not pine when he sees the other in
reputation, but when he sees himself left behind: the envious not
so, but at the sight of another’s prosperity. And he is a kind
of drone, injuring other men’s labors; and himself never anxious
to rise, but weeping when he sees another rising, and doing every
thing to throw him down. To what then might one compare this
passion? It seems to me to be like as if a sluggish ass and heavy
with abundance of flesh, being yoked with a winged courser, should
neither himself be willing to rise, and should attempt to drag the
other down by the weight of his carcase. For so this man takes no
thought nor anxiety to be himself rid of this deep slumber, but
doth every thing to supplant and throw down him that is flying
towards heaven, becoming an exact emulator of the devil: since he
too, seeing man in paradise, sought not to change his own
condition, but to cast him out of paradise. And again, seeing him
seated in heaven and the rest hastening thither, he holds to the
same plan, supplanting them who are hastening thither and hereby
heaping up the furnace more abundantly for himself. For in every
instance this happens: both he that is envied, if he be vigilant,
becoming more eminent; and he that is envious, accumulating to
himself more evils. Thus also Joseph became eminent, thus Aaron
the priest: the conspiracy of the envious caused God once and
again to give His suffrage for him, and was the occasion of the
rod’s budding. Thus Jacob attained his abundant wealth and all
those other blessings. Thus the envious pierce themselves through
with ten thousand evils. Knowing as we do all these things, let
us flee such emulation. For wherefore, tell me, enviest thou? 
Because thy brother hath received spiritual grace? And from whom
did he receive it? answer me. Was it not from God? Clearly then
He is the object of the enmity to Which thou art committing
thyself, He the bestower of the gift. Seest thou which way the
evil is tending, and with what sort of a point it is crowning the
heap of thy sins; and how deep the pit of vengeance which it is
digging for thee?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxii-p38">Let us flee it, then, beloved, and neither envy
others, nor fail to pray for our enviers and do all we can to
extinguish their passion: neither let us feel as the unthinking
do who being minded to exact punishment of them, do all in their
power to light up their flame. But let not us do so; rather let
us weep for them and lament. For they are the injured persons,
having continual worm gnawing through their heart, and collecting a
fountain of poison more bitter than any gall. Come now, let us
beseech the merciful God, both to change their state of feeling and
that we may never fall into that disease: since heaven is indeed
inaccessible to him that hath this wasting sore, and before heaven
too, even this present life is not worth living in. For not so
thoroughly are timber and wool wont to be eaten through by moth and
worm abiding therein, as doth the fever of envy devour the very
bones of the envious and destroy all self-command in their
soul.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxii-p39">In order then that we may deliver both ourselves and
others from these innumerable woes, let us expel from within us
this evil fever, this that is more grievous than any gangrene: 
that having regained spiritual strength, we may both finish the
present course and obtain the future crowns; unto which may we all
attain, by the grace and mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ, with Whom
to the Father, with the Holy Ghost, be glory, power, honor, now and
ever, and world without end. Amen.</p>

<p class="c24" id="iv.xxxiii-p4"><span class="c18" id="iv.xxxiii-p4.1">For</span> lest any should say,
“What is the example of the body to us? since the body is a slave
to nature but our good deeds are of choice;” he applies it to our
own concerns; and to signify that we ought to have the same concord
of design as they have from nature, he saith, “Now ye are the
body of Christ.” But if our body ought not to be divided, much
less the body of Christ, and so much less as grace is more powerful
than nature.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiii-p5"> But what is the expression, “severally?”
“So far at least as appertaineth to you; and so far as naturally
a part should be built up from you.” For because he had said,
“the body,” whereas the whole body was not the Corinthian
Church, but the Church in every part of the world, therefore he
said, “severally:” i.e., the Church amongst you is a part of
the Church existing every where and of the body which is made up of
all the Churches: so that not only with yourselves alone, but
also with the whole Church throughout the world, ye ought to be at
peace, if at least ye be members of the whole body.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiii-p6">[2.] <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 12.28" id="iv.xxxiii-p6.1" parsed="|1Cor|12|28|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.12.28">Ver. 28</scripRef>. “And God hath set some in
the Church: first apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly teachers,
then miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, divers
kinds of tongues.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiii-p7">Thus what I spake of before, this also he now
doth. Because they thought highly of themselves in respect of the
tongues he sets it last every where. For the terms, “first”
and “secondly,” are not used by him here at random, but in
order by enumeration to point out the more honorable and the
inferior. Wherefore also he set the apostles first who had all
the gifts in themselves. And he said not, “God hath set certain
in the Church, apostles” simply, “or prophets,” but he
employs “first, second,” and “third,” signifying that same
thing which I told you of.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiii-p8">“Secondly, prophets.” For they used to
prophesy, as the daughters of Philip, as Agabus, as these very
persons among the Corinthians, of whom he saith, “Let the
prophets speak, two or three.” (c. <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 14.29" id="iv.xxxiii-p8.1" parsed="|1Cor|14|29|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.14.29">xiv. 29</scripRef>.) And writing also to
Timothy, he said, “Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which
was given thee by prophecy.” (<scripRef passage="1 Tim. iv. 14" id="iv.xxxiii-p8.2" parsed="|1Tim|4|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.4.14">1 Tim. iv. 14</scripRef>.) And they were much more
many that prophesied. And if Christ saith, “The Law and the
Prophets prophesied until John,” (S. 
<scripRef passage="Matt. xi. 13" id="iv.xxxiii-p8.3" parsed="|Matt|11|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.11.13">Matt. xi. 13</scripRef>.) He saith it of those
prophets who before proclaimed His coming.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiii-p9">“Thirdly, teachers.” For he that prophesieth
speaks all things from the Spirit; but he that teacheth sometimes
discourses also out of his own mind. Wherefore also he said,
“Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor,
especially they who labor in the word and in teaching:” (<scripRef passage="1 Tim. v. 17" id="iv.xxxiii-p9.1" parsed="|1Tim|5|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.5.17">1 Tim. v. 17</scripRef>.) whereas he that speaks all
things by the Spirit doth not labor. This accordingly is the
reason why he set him after the prophet, because the one is wholly
a gift but the other is also man’s labor. For he speaks many
things of his own mind, agreeing however with the sacred
Scriptures.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiii-p10">[3.] “Then miracles, then gifts of healings.”
 Seest thou how he again divides the healings from the power,
which also he did before. For the power is more than the
healing: since he that hath power both punishes and heals, but he
that hath the gift of healings doeth cures only. And observe how
excellent the order he made use of, when he set the prophecy before
the miracles and the healings. For above when he said, “To one
is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom, and to another the word
of knowledge,” he spake, not setting them in order, but
indifferently. Here, on the other hand, he sets a first and a
second rank. Wherefore then doth he set 
<pb n="187" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_187.html" id="iv.xxxiii-Page_187" />prophecy first? Because even in the old
covenant the matter has this order. For example, when Isaiah was
discoursing with the Jews, and exhibiting a demonstration of the
power of God, and bringing forward the evidence of the
worthlessness of the demons, he stated this also as the greater
evidence of his divinity, his foretelling things to come. (<scripRef passage="Is. xli. 22, 23" id="iv.xxxiii-p10.1" parsed="|Isa|41|22|41|23" osisRef="Bible:Isa.41.22-Isa.41.23">Is. xli. 22, 23</scripRef>.) And Christ Himself after
working so many signs saith that this was no small sign of His
divinity: and continually adds, “But these things have I told
you, that when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am
He.” (S. <scripRef passage="John xiii. 19; xiv. 29; xvi. 4" id="iv.xxxiii-p10.2" parsed="|John|13|19|0|0;|John|14|29|0|0;|John|16|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.13.19 Bible:John.14.29 Bible:John.16.4">John xiii.
19; xiv. 29; xvi. 4</scripRef>.)</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiii-p11">“Well then; the gifts of healing are justly
inferior to prophecy. But why likewise to teaching?” Because
it is not the same thing to declare the word of preaching and sow
piety in the hearts of the hearers, as it is to work miracles: 
since these are done merely for the sake of that. When therefore
any one teaches both by word and life, he is greater than all.
For those he calls emphatically teachers, who both teach by deeds
and instruct in word. For instance: this made the Apostles
themselves to become Apostles. And those gifts certain others
also, of no great worth, received in the beginning, as they who
said, “Lord, did we not prophesy by Thy Name, and do mighty
works?” and after this were told, “I never knew you; depart
from Me, ye that work iniquity.” (S. 
<scripRef passage="Matt. vii. 22" id="iv.xxxiii-p11.1" parsed="|Matt|7|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.7.22">Matt. vii. 22</scripRef>.) But this twofold mode of
teaching, I mean that by deeds and by words, no bad man would ever
undertake. As to his setting the prophets first marvel not at
it. For he is not speaking of prophets simply, but of those who
by prophecy do also teach and say every thing to the common
benefit: which in proceeding he makes more clear to us.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiii-p12">“Helps, governments.” What is,
“helps?” To support the weak. Is this then a gift, tell
me? In the first place, this too is of the Gift of God, aptness
for a patron’s office<note place="end" n="194" id="iv.xxxiii-p12.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxiii-p13"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxxiii-p13.1">προστατικόν εἶναι</span>.</p></note>; the dispensing spiritual things;
besides which he calls many even of our own good deeds,
“gifts;” not meaning us to lose heart, but showing that in
every case we need God’s help, and preparing them to be thankful,
and thereby making them more forward and stirring up their
minds.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiii-p14">“Divers kind of tongues.” Seest thou where he
hath set this gift, and how he every where assigns it the last
rank?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiii-p15">[4.] Further, since again by this catalogue he had
pointed out a great difference, and stirred up the afore-mentioned
distemper of those that had lesser gifts, he darts upon them in
what follows with great vehemence, because he had already given
them those many proofs of their not being left much inferior.
What I mean is; because it was likely that on hearing these things
they would say, “And why were we not all made
Apostles?”—whereas above he had made use of a more soothing
tone of discourse, proving at length the necessity of this result,
even from the image of the body; for “the body,” saith he,
“is not one member;” and again, “but if all were one member,
where were the body?” and from the fact that they were given for
use; for to each one is given “the manifestation of the
Spirit,” saith he, “to profit withal:” and from all being
watered from the same Spirit: and from what is bestowed being a
free gift and not a debt; “for there are,” saith he,
“diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit:” and from the
manifestation of the Spirit being made alike through all; for “to
each one,” saith he, “is given the manifestation through the
Spirit:” and from the fact that these things were shaped
according to the pleasure of the Spirit and of God; “for all
these,” saith he, “worketh the one and the same Spirit,
dividing to each one severally even as he will:” and, “God
hath set the members each one of them in the body, even as it
pleased Him:” and from the inferior members also being
necessary; “for those which seem,” saith he, “to be more
feeble are necessary:” from their being alike necessary, in
that they “from the greater too needing the less: “for the
head,” saith he, “cannot say to the feet, I have no need of
you:” from these latter enjoying even more honor; for “to
that which lacketh,” saith he, “He hath given more abundant
honor:” from the care of them being common and equal; for
“for all the members have the same care one for another:” and
from there being one honor and one grief of them all; for
“whether,” saith he, “one member suffereth, all the members
suffer with it; or one member is honored, all the members rejoice
with it:”—whereas, I say, he had above exhorted them by these
topics, here and henceforth he uses language so as to bear them
down and rebuke them. For, as I said, it behoves us neither
always to exhort people nor always to silence them. Therefore
also Paul himself, because he at length exhorted them, doth
henceforth vehemently attack them, saying,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiii-p16"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 12.29" id="iv.xxxiii-p16.1" parsed="|1Cor|12|29|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.12.29">Ver. 29</scripRef>. “Are all apostles? are
all prophets? have all gifts of healing?”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiii-p17">And he doth not stop at the first and the second
gift, but proceeds to the last, either meaning this that all cannot
be all things, (even as he there saith, “if all were one member,
where were the body?”) or establishing some other point also
along with these, which may tell in the way of consolation again.
What then is this? His signifying that even the lesser gifts
<pb n="188" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_188.html" id="iv.xxxiii-Page_188" />are contended for equally with
the greater, from the circumstance that not even these were given
absolutely to all? For “why,” saith he, “dost thou grieve
that thou hast not gifts of healing? consider that what thou hast,
even though it be less, is oftentimes not possessed by him that
hath the greater.” Wherefore he saith,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiii-p18"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 12.30" id="iv.xxxiii-p18.1" parsed="|1Cor|12|30|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.12.30">Ver. 30</scripRef>. “Do all speak with
tongues? do all interpret?”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiii-p19">For even as the great gifts God hath not vouchsafed
all to all men, but to some this, and to others that, so also did
He in respect of the less, not proposing these either to all. And
this He did, procuring thereby abundant harmony and love, that each
one standing in need of the other might be brought close to his
brother. This economy He established also in the arts, this also
in the elements, this also in the plants, and in our members, and
absolutely in all things.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiii-p20">[5.] Then he subjoins further the most powerful
consolation, and sufficient to recover them and quiet their vexed
souls. And what is this?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiii-p21"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 12.31" id="iv.xxxiii-p21.1" parsed="|1Cor|12|31|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.12.31">Ver. 31</scripRef>. “Desire earnestly,”
saith he, “the better gifts. And a still more excellent way
show I unto you.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiii-p22">Now by saying this, he gently hinted that they
were the cause of their own receiving the lesser gifts, and had it
in their power, if they would, to receive the greater. For when
he saith, “desire earnestly,” he demands from them all
diligence and desire for spiritual things. And he said not, the
greater gifts, but “the better,” i.e., the more useful, those
which would profit. And what he means is this: “continue to
desire gifts; and I point out to you a fountain of gifts.” For
neither did he say, “a gift,” but “a way,” that he might
the more extol that which he intends to mention. As if he said,
It is not one, or two, or three gifts that I point out to you, but
one way which leadeth to all these<note place="end" n="195" id="iv.xxxiii-p22.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxiii-p23"> [Chrysostom’s view of the text is made more
plain by a rendering somewhat different from that of the English
translator and of both the Authorized Version and the Revised.
“Desire earnestly the better gifts. And furthermore I show you
a very excellent way to do it.” The contrast is not between the
“gifts” on one hand and love on the other, but between
eagerness of emulation and the pursuit of love as a means of
attaining the gifts. In this the Greek expositor anticipates the
conclusions of the best modern critics, such as DeWette, Meyer,
Alford, Hodge, Heinrici, etc. The view is sustained by the
natural force of the words used and by the connection. It is true
that the superiority of love as a means is lost sight of in the
beautiful panegyric of love that follows, but that seems due to the
ardor of the writer’s mind and the attractiveness of the theme.
It is not through the pursuit and exercise of gifts that we attain
to love; but it is love that develops the gifts within us, and love
is greater than gifts. The reason why the Apostle indulges here
in the digression which occupies the thirteenth chapter is thus
given by Principal Edwards (<i>in loco</i>). “Partly to rebuke
indirectly the dissension of the Corinthian Church, partly a
statement of the peculiarly Christian means to secure possession of
the <i>Charismata</i> for the edification of the Church and render
them innocuous to their possessor, partly also a glimpse of a moral
development different in kind from gifts and greater in moral worth
than all other moral virtues, partly a reiteration in a new form of
the idea that the Church is an organic body.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiii-p24">In the whole passage the
English translator adhered to the rendering of the Authorized
Version, “charity,” which Wyclif used for the <i>charitas</i>
of the Vulgate. I have changed this to “love” which, besides
its unambiguousness and its more exact conformity to the original,
admits of the deeper meaning and wider application which makes God
as well as our brethren the object of the affection.
C.]</p></note>: and not merely a way, but both
“a more excellent way” and one that is open in common to all.
For not as the gifts are vouchsafed, to some these, to others
those, but not all to all; so also in this case: but it is an
universal gift. Wherefore also he invites all to it. “Desire
earnestly,” saith he, “the better gifts and yet show I unto you
a more excellent way;” meaning love towards our
neighbor.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiii-p25">Then intending to proceed to the discourse
concerning it and the encomium of this virtue, he first lowereth
these by comparison with it, intimating that they are nothing
without it; very considerately.  For if he had at once discoursed
of love, and having said, “I show unto you a way,” had added,
“but this is love,” and had not conducted his discourse by way
of comparison; some might possibly have scoffed at what was said,
not understanding clearly the force of the thing spoken of but
still gaping after these. Wherefore he doth not at once unfold
it, but first excites the hearer by the promise, and saith, “I
show unto you a more excellent way,” and so having led him to
desire it, he doth not even thus straightway proceed to it, but
augmenting still further and extending their desire, he discourses
first of these very things, and shows that without it they are
nothing; reducing them to the greatest necessity of loving one
another; seeing also that from neglect of it sprang that which
caused all their evils. So that in this respect also it might
justly appear great, if the gifts not only brought them not
together, but divided them even when united: but this, when many
were so divided, would reunite them by virtue of its own and make
them one body. This however he doth not say at once, but what
they chiefly longed for, that he sets down; as that the thing was a
gift and a most excellent way to all the gifts. So that, even if
thou wilt not love thy brother on the score of friendship, yet for
the sake of obtaining a better sign and an abundant gift, cherish
love.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiii-p26">[6.] And see whence he first begins; from that
which was marvellous in their eyes and great, the gift of
tongues. And in bringing forward that gift, he mentions it not
just in the degree they had it in, but far more. For he did not
say, “if I speak with tongues,” but,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiii-p27"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 13.1" id="iv.xxxiii-p27.1" parsed="|1Cor|13|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.13.1">Chap. xiii. ver. 1</scripRef>. “If I speak with the
tongues of men,—”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiii-p28">What is, “of men?” Of all nations in every
part of the world. And neither was he content with this
amplification, but he likewise uses another much greater, adding
the words, <pb n="189" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_189.html" id="iv.xxxiii-Page_189" />“and of
angels,—and have not love, I am become sounding brass, or a
clanging cymbal.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiii-p29">Dost thou see to what point he first exalted the
gift, and to what afterwards he lowered and cast it down? For
neither did he simply say, “I am nothing,” but, “I am become
sounding brass,” a thing senseless and inanimate. But how
“sounding brass?” Emitting a sound indeed, but at random and
in vain, and for no good end. Since besides my profiting nothing,
I am counted by most men as one giving impertinent trouble, an
annoying and wearisome kind of person. Seest thou how one void of
love is like to things inanimate and senseless?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiii-p30">Now he here speaks of the “tongues of angels,”
not investing angels with a body, but what he means is this: 
“should I even so speak as angels are wont to discourse unto each
other, without this I am nothing, nay rather a burden and an
annoyance.” Thus (to mention one other example) where he saith,
“To Him every knee shall bow, of things in heaven and things on
earth, and things under the earth,” (<scripRef passage="Philip. ii. 10" id="iv.xxxiii-p30.1" parsed="|Phil|2|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Phil.2.10">Philip. ii. 10</scripRef>.) he doth not say these things
as if he attributed to angels knees and bones, far from it, but it
is their intense adoration which he intends to shadow out by the
fashion amongst us: so also here he calls it “a tongue” not
meaning an instrument of flesh, but intending to indicate their
converse with each other by the manner which is known amongst
us.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiii-p31">[7.] Then, in order that his discourse may be
acceptable, he stops not at the gift of tongues, but proceeds also
to the remaining gifts; and having depreciated all in the absence
of love, he then depicts her image. And because he preferred to
conduct his argument by amplification, he begins from the less and
ascends to the greater. For whereas, when he indicated their
order, he placed the gift of tongues last, this he now numbers
first; by degrees, as I said, ascending to the greater gifts.
Thus having spoken of tongues, he proceeds immediately to prophecy;
and saith;</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiii-p32"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 13.2" id="iv.xxxiii-p32.1" parsed="|1Cor|13|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.13.2">Ver. 2</scripRef>.
“And if I have the gift of prophecy.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiii-p33">And this gift again with an excellency. For as in
that case he mentioned not tongues, but the tongues of all mankind,
and as he proceeded, those of angels, and then signified that the
gift was nothing without love: so also here he mentions not
prophecy alone but the very highest prophecy: in having said,
“If I have prophecy,” he added, “and know all mysteries and
all knowledge;” expressing this gift also with intensity.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiii-p34">Then after this also he proceeds to the other
gifts. And again, that he might not seem to weary them, naming
each one of the gifts, he sets down the mother and fountain of all,
and this again with an excellency, thus saying, “And if I have
all faith.” Neither was he content with this, but even that
which Christ spake of as greatest, this also he added, saying,
“so as to remove mountains and have not love, I am nothing.”
And consider how again here also he lowers the dignity of the
tongues. For whereas in regard of prophecy he signifies the great
advantage arising from it, “the understanding mysteries, and
having all knowledge;” and in regard of faith, no trifling work,
even “the removing mountains;” in respect of tongues, on the
other hand, having named the gift itself only, he quits it.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiii-p35">But do thou, I pray, consider this also, how in
brief he comprehended all gifts when he named prophecy and faith: 
for miracles are either in words or deeds. And how doth Christ
say, that the least degree of faith is the being able to remove a
mountain? For as though he were speaking something very small,
did He express Himself when He said, “If ye have faith as a grain
of mustard-seed, ye shall say to this mountain, Remove, and it
shall remove;” (S. <scripRef passage="Matt. xvii. 20" id="iv.xxxiii-p35.1" parsed="|Matt|17|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.17.20">Matt.
xvii. 20</scripRef>.) whereas Paul
saith that this is “all faith.” What then must one say? 
Since this was a great thing, the removing a mountain, therefore
also he mentioned it, not as though “all faith” were only able
to do this, but since this seemed to be great to the grosser sort
because of the bulk of the outward mass, from this also he extols
his subject. And what he saith is this:</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiii-p36">“If I have all faith, and can remove mountains,
but have not love, I am nothing.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiii-p37">[8.] <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 13.3" id="iv.xxxiii-p37.1" parsed="|1Cor|13|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.13.3">Ver. 3</scripRef>. “And if I bestow all my
goods to feed the poor, and if I give my body to be burned, but
have not love, it profiteth me nothing.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiii-p38">Wonderful amplification!  For even these
things too he states with another addition: in that he said not,
“if I give to the poor the half of my goods,” or “two or
three parts,” but, “though I give all my goods.” And he
said not, “give,” but, “distribute in morsels<note place="end" n="196" id="iv.xxxiii-p38.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxiii-p39"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxxiii-p39.1">ψωμίσω</span>.</p></note>,” so that
to the expense may be added the administering also with all
care.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiii-p40">But not even yet have I pointed out the whole of the
excellency, until I bring forward the testimonies of Christ which
were spoken concerning almsgiving and death. What then are His
testimonies? To the rich man He saith, “If thou wouldest be
perfect, sell what thou hast and give to the poor, and come, follow
me.” (S. <scripRef passage="Matt. xix. 21" id="iv.xxxiii-p40.1" parsed="|Matt|19|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.19.21">Matt. xix.
21</scripRef>.) And discoursing
likewise of love to <pb n="190" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_190.html" id="iv.xxxiii-Page_190" />one’s
neighbor, He saith, “Greater love hath no man than this, that a
man may lay down his life for his friends.” (S. <scripRef passage="John xiv. 13" id="iv.xxxiii-p40.2" parsed="|John|14|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.14.13">John xiv. 13</scripRef>.) Whence it is evident, that
even before God this is greatest of all. But, “I declare,”
said Paul, “that even if we should lay down life for God’s
sake, and not merely lay it down, but so as even to be burned, (for
this is the meaning of, “if I give my body to be burned,”) we
shall have no great advantage if we love not our neighbor.”
Well then, the saying that the gifts are of no great profit without
charity is no marvel: since our gifts are a secondary
consideration to our way of life. At any rate, many have
displayed gifts, and yet on becoming vicious have been punished: 
as those who “prophesied in His name, and cast out many demons,
and wrought many mighty works;” as Judas the traitor: while
others, exhibiting as believers a pure life, have needed nothing
else in order to their salvation. Wherefore, that the gifts
should, as I said, require this, is no marvel: but that an exact
life even should avail nothing without it, this is what brings the
intensity of expression strongly out and causes great perplexity: 
especially too when Christ appears to adjudge His great rewards to
both these, I mean to the giving up our possessions, and to the
perils of martyrdom. For both to the rich man He saith, as I
before observed, “If thou wilt be perfect, sell thy goods, and
give to the poor, and come, follow me:” and discoursing with
the disciples, of martyrdom He saith, “Whosoever shall lose his
life for My sake, shall find it;” and, “Whosoever shall confess
Me before men, him will I also confess before My Father which is in
heaven.” For great indeed is the labor of this achievement, and
well nigh surpassing nature itself, and this is well known to such
as have had these crowns vouchsafed to them. For no language can
set it before us: so noble a soul doth the deed belong to and so
exceedingly wonderful is it.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiii-p41">[9.] But nevertheless, this so wonderful
thing Paul said was of no great profit without love, even though it
have the giving up of one’s goods joined with it. Wherefore
then hath he thus spoken? This will I now endeavor to explain,
first having enquired of this, How is it possible that one who
gives all his goods to feed the poor can be wanting in love? I
grant, indeed, he that is ready to be burned and hath the gifts,
may perhaps possibly not have love: but he who not only gives his
goods, but even distributes them in morsels; how hath not he
love?<note place="end" n="197" id="iv.xxxiii-p41.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxiii-p42"> [The point which Chrysostom so anxiously discusses
is much more readily settled by modern interpreters. Thus one of
them says, “All outward acts of beneficence are of no avail
without love. A man may give away his whole estate, or sacrifice
himself, and be in no sense the gainer. He may do all this from
vanity, or from the fear of perdition, or to purchase heaven, and
only increase his condemnation. Religion is no such easy thing.
Men would gladly compound by external acts of beneficence or by
penances for a change of heart; but the thing is impossible.
Thousands indeed are deluded on this point, and think that they can
substitute what is outward for what is inward, but God requires the
heart, and without holiness the most liberal giver or the most
suffering ascetic can never see God.” (Hodge)  The address of
our Saviour to the rich young ruler was not intended to furnish a
general rule of action or even to specify a particular kind of
perfection. When he told the earnest enquirer to sell all that he
had the object was to disclose to him his inordinate love of this
world’s goods and so lead him to see how far he was from the
perfection which he had claimed. Chrysostom’s use of this
passage is precisely that which was made by Anthony, the first of
the Fathers of the Desert, and by St. Francis of Assisi, and which
lies at the basis of the whole monastic system. C.]</p></note>  What then
are we to say? Either that he supposed an unreal case as real;
which kind of thing he is ever wont to do, when he intends to set
before us something in excess; as when writing to the Galatians he
saith, “If we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel
unto you than that ye receive let him be accursed.”
(<scripRef passage="Gal. i. 8" id="iv.xxxiii-p42.1" parsed="|Gal|1|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gal.1.8">Gal. i. 8</scripRef>.) And
yet neither was himself nor an angel about to do so; but to signify
that he meant to carry the matter as far as possible, he set down
even that which could never by any means happen. And again, when
he writes to the Romans, and saith, “Neither angels, nor
principalities, nor powers, shall be able to separate us from the
love of God;” for neither was this about to be done by any
angels: but here too he supposes a thing which was not; as indeed
also in what comes next, saying, “nor any other creature,”
whereas there is no other creature, for he had comprehended the
whole creation, having spoken of all things both above and below.
Nevertheless here also he mentions that which was not, by way of
hypothesis, so as to show his exceeding desire. Now the same
thing he doth here also, saying, “If a man give all, and have not
love, it profits him nothing.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiii-p43">Either then we may say this, or that his meaning is
for those who give to be also joined closely to those who retire,
and not merely to give without sympathy, but in pity and
condescension, bowing down and grieving with the needy. For
therefore also hath almsgiving been enacted by God: since God
might have nourished the poor as well without this, but that he
might bind us together unto charity and that we might be thoroughly
fervent toward each other, he commanded them to be nourished by
us. Therefore one saith in another place also; “a good word is
better than a gift;” (<scripRef passage="Ecclesiasticus 18.16,17" id="iv.xxxiii-p43.1" parsed="|Sir|18|16|18|17" osisRef="Bible:Sir.18.16-Sir.18.17">Ecclus. xviii. 16,
17</scripRef>.) and, “behold, a
word is beyond a good gift.” (<scripRef passage="Ecclesiasticus 18.16,17" id="iv.xxxiii-p43.2" parsed="|Sir|18|16|18|17" osisRef="Bible:Sir.18.16-Sir.18.17">Ecclus. xviii. 16,
17</scripRef>.) And He Himself
saith, “I will have mercy, and not sacrifice.” (S. <scripRef passage="Matt. ix. 30; Hos. vi. 6" id="iv.xxxiii-p43.3" parsed="|Matt|9|30|0|0;|Hos|6|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.9.30 Bible:Hos.6.6">Matt. ix. 30; Hos. vi. 6</scripRef>.) For since it is usual,
both for men to love those who are benefited by them, and for those
who receive benefits to be more kindly affected towards their
benefactors; he made this law, constituting it a bond of
friendship.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiii-p44">[10.] But the point proposed for enquiry above is,
How, after Christ had said that both these belong to perfection,
Paul affirms, that <pb n="191" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_191.html" id="iv.xxxiii-Page_191" />these
without charity are imperfect? Not contradicting Him, God forbid:
 but harmonizing with Him, and that exactly. For so in the case
of the rich man, He said, not merely, “sell thy goods, and give
to the poor,” but He added, “and come, follow Me.” Now not
even the following Him proves any man a disciple of Christ so
completely as the loving one another. For, “by this shall all
men know,” saith He, “that ye are My disciples, if ye have love
one to another.” (S. 
<scripRef passage="John xiii. 35" id="iv.xxxiii-p44.1" parsed="|John|13|35|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.13.35">John xiii. 35</scripRef>.) And also when He saith,
“Whosoever loseth his life for My sake, shall find it;” (S.
<scripRef passage="Matt. x. 39, 35" id="iv.xxxiii-p44.2" parsed="|Matt|10|39|0|0;|Matt|10|35|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.10.39 Bible:Matt.10.35">Matt. x. 39, 35</scripRef>.) and, “whosoever shall
confess Me before men, him will I also confess before My Father
which is in heaven;” He means not this, that it is not necessary
to have love, but He declares the reward which is laid up for these
labors. Since that along with martyrdom He requires also this, is
what He elsewhere strongly intimates, thus saying, “Ye shall
indeed drink of My cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am
baptized with;” (S. 
<scripRef passage="Matt. xx. 23" id="iv.xxxiii-p44.3" parsed="|Matt|20|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.20.23">Matt. xx. 23</scripRef>.) i.e., ye shall be martyrs,
ye shall be slain for My sake; “but to sit on My right hand, and
on My left, (not as though any sit on the right hand and the left,
but meaning the highest precedency and honor) “is not Mine to
give,” saith He, “but to those for whom it is prepared.”
Then signifying for whom it is prepared, He calls them and saith,
“whosoever among you will be chief, let him be servant to you
all;” (S. <scripRef passage="Matt. xx. 26" id="iv.xxxiii-p44.4" parsed="|Matt|20|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.20.26">Matt. xx.
26</scripRef>.) setting forth
humility and love. And the love which He requires is intense;
wherefore He stopped not even at this, but added, “even as the
Son of Man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to
give His life a ransom for many;” pointing out that we ought so
to love as even to be slain for our beloved. For this above all
is to love Him. Wherefore also He saith to Peter, “If thou
lovest Me, feed My sheep.” (S. 
<scripRef passage="John xxi. 16" id="iv.xxxiii-p44.5" parsed="|John|21|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.21.16">John xxi. 16</scripRef>.)</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiii-p45">[11.] And that ye may learn how great a work of
virtue it is, let us sketch it out in word, since in deeds we see
it no where appearing; and let us consider, if it were every where
in abundance, how great benefits would ensue: how there were no
need then of laws, or tribunals or punishments, or avenging, or any
other such things since if all loved and were beloved, no man would
injure another. Yea, murders, and strifes, and wars, and
divisions, and rapines, and frauds, and all evils would be removed,
and vice be unknown even in name. Miracles, however, would not
have effected this; they rather puff up such as are not on their
guard, unto vain-glory and folly.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiii-p46">Again: what is indeed the marvellous part of love;
all the other good things have their evils yoked with them: as he
that gives up his possessions is oftentimes puffed up on this
account: the eloquent is affected with a wild passion for glory;
the humble-minded, on this very ground, not seldom thinks highly of
himself in his conscience. But love is free from every such
mischief. For none could ever be lifted up against the person
whom he loves. And do not, I pray, suppose one person only loving
but all alike; and then wilt thou see its virtue. Or rather, if
thou wilt, first suppose one single person beloved, and one loving;
loving, however, as it is meet to love. Why, he will so live on
earth as if it were heaven, every where enjoying a calm and weaving
for himself innumerable crowns. For both from envy, and wrath,
and jealousy, and pride, and vain-glory, and evil concupiscence,
and every profane love, and every distemper, such a man will keep
his own soul pure. Yea, even as no one would do himself an injury
so neither would this man his neighbors. And being such, he shall
stand with Gabriel himself, even while he walks on earth.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiii-p47">Such then is he that hath love. But he that works
miracles and hath perfect knowledge, without this, though he raises
ten thousand from the dead, will not be much profited, broken off
as he is from all and not enduring to mix himself up with any of
his fellow-servants. For no other cause than this did Christ say
that the sign of perfect love towards Him is the loving one’s
neighbors. For, “if thou lovest Me,” saith He, “O Peter,
more than these, feed My sheep.” (S. 
<scripRef passage="John xxi. 15" id="iv.xxxiii-p47.1" parsed="|John|21|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.21.15">John xxi. 15</scripRef>.) Dost thou see how hence
also He again covertly intimates, in what case this is greater than
martyrdom? For if any one had a beloved child in whose behalf he
would even give up his life, and some one were to love the father,
but pay no regard whatever to the son, he would greatly incense the
father; nor would he feel the love for himself, because of the
overlooking his son. Now if this ensue in the case of father and
son, much more in the case of God and men: since surely God is
more loving than any parents.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiii-p48">Wherefore, having said, “The first and great
commandment is, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God,” he added,
“and the second—(He leaves it not in silence, but sets it down
also)—is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as
thyself.” And see how with nearly the same excellency He
demands also this. For as concerning God, He saith, “with all
thy heart:” so concerning thy neighbor, “as thyself,” which
is tantamount to, “with all thy heart.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiii-p49">Yea, and if this were duly observed, there would be
neither slave nor free, neither ruler nor ruled, neither rich nor
poor, neither small nor great; nor would any devil then ever have
been known: I say not, Satan only, but whatever other such spirit
there be, nay, rather <pb n="192" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_192.html" id="iv.xxxiii-Page_192" />were
there a hundred or ten thousand such, they would have no power,
while love existed. For sooner would grass endure the application
of fire than the devil the flame of love. She is stronger than
any wall, she is firmer than any adamant; or if thou canst name any
material stronger than this the firmness of love transcends them
all. Her, neither wealth nor poverty overcometh: nay, rather
there would be no poverty, no unbounded wealth, if there were love,
but the good parts only from each estate. For from the one we
should reap its abundance, and from the other its freedom from
care: and should neither have to undergo the anxieties of riches,
nor the dread of poverty.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiii-p50">[12.] And why do I mention the advantages
arising from it? Yea, rather consider how great a blessing it is
of itself to exercise love; what cheerfulness it produces, in how
great grace it establishes the soul; a thing which above all is a
choice quality of it. For the other parts of virtue have each
their troubles yoked with them; as fasting, temperance, watching,
have envy, concupiscence, and contempt. But love along with the
gain hath great pleasure, too, and no trouble, and like an
industrious bee, gathering the sweets from every flower, deposits
them in the soul of him who loveth. Though any one be a slave, it
renders slavery sweeter that liberty. For he who loveth rejoices
not so much in commanding, as in being commanded, although to
command is sweet: but love changes the nature of things and
presents herself with all blessings in her hands, gentler than any
mother, wealthier than any queen, and makes difficulties light and
easy, causing our virtues to be facile, but vice very bitter to
us. As thus: to expend seems grievous, yet love makes it
pleasant: to receive other men’s goods, pleasant, but love
suffers it not to appear pleasant, but frames our minds to avoid it
as an evil. Again, to speak evil seems to be pleasant to all; but
love, while she makes this out to be bitter, causeth speaking well
to be pleasant; for nothing is so sweet to us as to be praising one
whom we love. Again, anger hath a kind of pleasure; but in this
case no longer, rather all its sinews are taken away. Though he
that is beloved should grieve him who loves him, anger no where
shows itself; but tears and exhortations, and supplications; so far
is love from being exasperated: and should she behold one in
error, she mourns and is in pain; yet even this pain itself brings
pleasure. For the very tears and the grief of love, are sweeter
than any mirth and joy. For instance: they that laugh are not
so refreshed as they that weep for their friends. And if thou
doubt it, stop their tears; and they repine at it not otherwise
than as persons intolerably ill-used. “But there is,” said
one, “an unbecoming pleasure in love.<note place="end" n="198" id="iv.xxxiii-p50.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxiii-p51"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxxiii-p51.1">τό φιλεῖν</span>.</p></note>” Avaunt, and hold thy peace,
whoever thou art. For nothing is so pure from such pleasure as
genuine love.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiii-p52">For tell me not of this ordinary sort, the vulgar
and low-minded, and a disease rather than love, but of this which
Paul seeks after, which considers the profit of them that are
loved; and thou shalt see that no fathers are so affectionate as
persons of this stamp. And even as they who love money cannot
endure to spend money, but would with more pleasure be in straits
than see their wealth diminishing: so too, he that is kindly
affected towards any one, would choose to suffer ten thousand evils
than see his beloved one injured.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiii-p53">[13.] “How then,” saith one, “did the
Egyptian woman who loved Joseph wish to injure him?” Because
she loved with this diabolical love. Joseph however not with
this, but with that which Paul requires. Consider then how great
a love his words were tokens of, and the action which she was
speaking of. “Insult me and make me an adulteress, and wrong my
husband, and overthrow all my house, and cast thyself out from thy
confidence towards God:” which were expressions of one who so
far from loving him did not even love herself. But because he
truly loved, he sought to avert her from all these. And to
convince you that it was in anxiety for her, learn the nature of it
from his advice. For he not only thrust her away, but also
introduced an exhortation capable of quenching every flame: 
namely “if on my account, my master,” saith he, “knoweth not
any thing which is in his house.” He at once reminds her of her
husband that he might put her to shame. And he said not, “thy
husband,” but “my master,” which was more apt to restrain her
and induce her to consider who she was, and of whom she was
enamored,—a mistress, of a slave. “For if he be lord, then
art thou mistress. Be ashamed then of familiarity with a servant,
and consider whose wife thou art, and with whom thou wouldst be
connected, and towards whom thou art becoming thankless and
inconsiderate, and that I repay him greater good-will.” And see
how he extols his benefits. For since that barbarous and
abandoned woman could entertain no lofty sentiment, he shames her
from human considerations, saying, “He knoweth nothing through
me,” i.e., “he is a great benefactor to me, and I cannot strike
my patron in a vital part. He hath made me a second lord of his
house, and no one<note place="end" n="199" id="iv.xxxiii-p53.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxiii-p54"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxxiii-p54.1">οὐδεὶς</span>, LXX <span class="Greek" id="iv.xxxiii-p54.2">οὐδέν</span>.</p></note> hath been
kept back from me, but thee.” Here he endeavors to raise her
mind, that so at any rate he might persuade her to be <pb n="193" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_193.html" id="iv.xxxiii-Page_193" />ashamed, and might signify the
greatness of her honor. Nor did he stop even here, but likewise
added a name sufficient to restrain her, saying, “Because thou
art his wife; and how shall I do this wickedness? But what sayest
thou? That thy husband is not present, nor knoweth that he is
wronged? But God will behold it.” She however profited
nothing by his advice, but still sought to attract him. For
desiring to satiate her own frenzy, not through love of Joseph, she
did these things; and this is evident from what she did
afterwards. As that she institutes a trial, and brings in
accusation, and bears false witness, and exposes to a wild beast
him that had done no wrong, and casts him into a prison; or rather
for her part, she even slew him, in such a manner did she arm the
judge against him. What then? Was then Joseph too such as she
was? Nay, altogether the contrary, for he neither contradicted
nor accused the woman. “Yes,” it may be said: “for he
would have been disbelieved.” And yet he was greatly beloved;
and this is evident not only from the beginning but also from the
end. For had not his barbarian master loved him greatly, he would
even have slain him in his silence, making no defence: being as
he was an Egyptian and a ruler, and wronged in his marriage-bed as
he supposed, and by a servant, and a servant to whom he had been so
great a benefactor. But all these things gave way to his regard
for him, and the grace which God poured down upon him. And
together with this grace and love, he had also other no small
proofs, had he been minded to justify himself; the garments
themselves. For if it were she to whom violence was done, her own
vest should have been torn, her face lacerated, instead of her
retaining his garments. But “he heard,” saith she, “that I
lifted up my voice, and left his garments, and went out.” And
wherefore then didst thou take them from him? since unto one
suffering violence, the one thing desirable is to be rid of the
intruder.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiii-p55">But not from hence alone, but also from the
subsequent events, shall I be able to point out his good-will and
his love. Yea even when he fell into a necessity of mentioning
the cause of his imprisonment, and his remaining there, he did not
even then declare the whole course of the story. But what saith
he? “I too have done nothing: but indeed I was stolen out of
the land of the Hebrews;” and he no where mentioned the
adulteress nor doth he plume himself on the matter, which would
have been any one’s feeling, if not for vain-glory, yet so as not
to appear to have been cast into that cell for an evil cause. For
if men in the act of doing wrong by no means abstain even so from
blaming the same things, although to do so brings reproach; of what
admiration is not he worthy, because, pure as he was he did not
mention the woman’s passion nor make a show of her sin; nor when
he ascended the throne and became ruler of all Egypt, remember the
wrong done by the woman nor exact any punishment?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiii-p56">Seest thou how he cared for her? but her’s was not
love, but madness. For it was not Joseph that she loved, but she
sought to fulfil her own lust. And the very words too, if one
would examine them accurately, were accompanied with wrath and
great blood-thirstiness. For what saith she? “Thou hast
brought in a Hebrew servant to mock us:” upbraiding her husband
for the kindness; and she exhibited the garments, having become
herself more savage than any wild beast: but not so he. And why
speak I of his good-will to her, when he was such, we know, towards
his brethren who would slay him; and never said one harsh thing of
them, either within doors or without?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiii-p57">[14.] Therefore Paul saith, that the love which we
are speaking of is the mother of all good things, and prefers it to
miracles and all other gifts. For as where there are vests and
sandals of gold, we require also some other garments whereby to
distinguish the king: but if we see the purple and the diadem, we
require not to see any other sign of his royalty: just so here
likewise, when the diadem of love is upon our head, it is enough to
point out the genuine disciple of Christ, not to ourselves only,
but also to the unbelievers. For, “by this,” saith He,
“shall all men know that ye are My disciples, if ye have love one
to another.” (S. <scripRef passage="John xiii. 35" id="iv.xxxiii-p57.1" parsed="|John|13|35|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.13.35">John
xiii. 35</scripRef>.) So that this
sign is greater surely than all signs, in that the disciple is
recognised by it. For though any should work ten thousand signs,
but be at strife one with another, they will be a scorn to the
unbelievers. Just as if they do no sign, but love one another
exactly, they will continue both reverenced and inviolable by all
men. Since Paul himself we admire on this account, not for the
dead whom he raised, nor for the lepers whom he cleansed, but
because he said, “who is weak, and I am not weak? who is made to
stumble, and I burn not?” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. xi. 29" id="iv.xxxiii-p57.2" parsed="|2Cor|11|29|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.11.29">2 Cor. xi. 29</scripRef>.) For shouldest thou have
ten thousand miracles to compare with this, thou wilt have nothing
equal to it to say. Since Paul also himself said, that a great
reward was laid up for him, not because he wrought miracles, but
because “to the weak he became as weak. For what is my
reward?” saith he. “That, when I preach the Gospel, I may
make the Gospel without charge.” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. ix. 18" id="iv.xxxiii-p57.3" parsed="|1Cor|9|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.9.18">1 Cor. ix. 18</scripRef>.) And when he puts himself
before the Apostles, he saith not, “I have wrought miracles more
abundant than they,” but, “I have 
<pb n="194" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_194.html" id="iv.xxxiii-Page_194" />labored more abundantly than they.” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. xv. 10" id="iv.xxxiii-p57.4" parsed="|1Cor|15|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.15.10">1 Cor. xv. 10</scripRef>.) And even by famine was he
willing to perish for the salvation of the disciples. “For it
were better for me to die,” saith he, “than that any man should
make my glorying void:” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. ix. 15" id="iv.xxxiii-p57.5" parsed="|1Cor|9|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.9.15">1 Cor. ix. 15</scripRef>.) not because he was glorying,
but that he might not seem to reproach them. For he no where is
wont to glory in his own achievements, when the season doth not
call to it; but even if he be compelled so to do he calleth himself
“a fool.” But if he ever glory it is “in infirmities,” in
wrongs, in greatly sympathizing with those who are injured: even
as here also he saith, “who is weak, and I am not weak?”
These words are greater even than perils. Wherefore also he sets
them last, amplifying his discourse.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiii-p58">Of what then must we be worthy compared with him,
who neither contemn wealth for our own sake, nor give up the
superfluities of our goods? But not so Paul; rather both soul and
body did he use to give up, that they who stoned and beat him with
rods, might obtain the kingdom. “For thus,” saith he, “hath
Christ taught me to love;” who left behind Him the new
commandment concerning love, which also Himself fulfilled in
deed. For being Lord of all, and of that Blessed Nature; from
men, whom He created out of nothing and on whom He had bestowed
innumerable benefits, from these, insulting and spitting on Him, He
turned not away, but even became man for their sakes, and conversed
with harlots and publicans, and healed the demoniacs, and promised
heaven. And after all these things they apprehended and beat him
with rods, bound, scourged, mocked, and at last crucified Him.
And not even so did He turn away, but even when He was on high upon
the cross, He saith, “Father, forgive them their sin.” But
the thief who before this reviled Him, He translated into very
paradise; and made the persecutor Paul, an Apostle; and gave up His
own disciples, who were His intimates and wholly devoted to Him,
unto death for the Jews’ sake who crucified Him.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiii-p59">Recollecting therefore in our minds all these
things, both those of God and of men, let us emulate these high
deeds, and possess ourselves of the love which is above all gifts,
that we may obtain both the present and the future blessings: the
which may we all obtain, through the grace and mercy of our Lord
Jesus Christ, with Whom to the Father, with the Holy Ghost, be
glory, power, honor, now and ever, and world without end.
Amen.</p>

<p class="c27" id="iv.xxxiv-p3">Love suffereth long, and is kind; love envieth not;
love vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up.</p>

<p class="c24" id="iv.xxxiv-p4"><span class="c18" id="iv.xxxiv-p4.1">Thus</span>, whereas he had
showed, that both faith and knowledge and prophecy and tongues and
gifts and healing and a perfect life and martyrdom, if love be
absent, are no great advantage; of necessity he next makes an
outline of its matchless beauty, adorning its image with the parts
of virtue as with a sort of colors, and putting together all its
members with exactness. But do not thou hastily pass by, beloved,
the things spoken, but examine each one of them with much care,
that thou mayest know both the treasure which is in the thing and
the art of the painter. Consider, for example, from what point he
at once began, and what he set first, as the cause of all its
excellence. And what is this? Long-suffering. This is the
root of all self-denial. Wherefore also a certain wise man said,
“A man that is long-suffering<note place="end" n="200" id="iv.xxxiv-p4.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxiv-p5"> “He that is slow to wrath,” Auth. Vers. <scripRef passage="Prov. xiv. 31" id="iv.xxxiv-p5.1" parsed="|Prov|14|31|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Prov.14.31">Prov. xiv. 31</scripRef>.</p></note> is of great understanding; but he
that is hasty of spirit is mightily foolish<note place="end" n="201" id="iv.xxxiv-p5.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxiv-p6"> “exalteth folly,” Auth. Vers.</p></note>.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiv-p7">And comparing it too with a strong city, he said
that it is more secure than that. For it is both an invincible
weapon and a sort of impregnable tower, easily beating off all
annoyances. And as a spark falling into the deep doth it no
injury, but is itself easily quenched: so upon a long-suffering
soul whatever unexpected thing falls, this indeed speedily
vanishes, but the soul it disturbs not: for of a truth there is
nothing so impenetrable as long-suffering. You may talk of
armies, money, horses, walls, arms, or any thing else whatsoever;
you will name nothing like long-suffering. For he that is
encompassed with those, oftentimes, being overcome by anger, is
upset like a worthless child, and fills all with confusion and
tempest: but this man, settled as it were in a harbor, enjoys a
profound calm. Though thou surround him 
<pb n="195" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_195.html" id="iv.xxxiv-Page_195" />with loss, thou hast not moved the rock; though
thou bring insult upon him, thou hast not shaken the tower: and
though thou bruise him with stripes, thou hast not wounded the
adamant.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiv-p8">Yea, and therefore is he called long-suffering,
because he hath a kind of long and great soul. For that which is
long is also called great. But this excellence is born of love,
both to them who possess and to them who enjoy it contributing no
small advantage. For tell me not of those abandoned wretches,
who, doing evil and suffering none, become worse: since here, not
from his long-suffering, but from those who abuse it, this result
arises. Tell me not therefore of these, but of those gentler
persons, who gain great benefit therefrom. For when, having done
ill, they suffer none, admiring the meekness of the sufferer, they
reap thereby a very great lesson of self command.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiv-p9">But Paul doth not stop here, but adds also the
other high achievements of love, saying, “is kind.” For since
there are some who practise their long-suffering with a view not to
their own self-denial, but to the punishment of those who have
provoked them, to make them burst with wrath; he saith that neither
hath charity this defect. Wherefore also he added, “is
kind.” For not at all with a view to light up the fire, in
those who are inflamed by anger, do they deal more gently<note place="end" n="202" id="iv.xxxiv-p9.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxiv-p10"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxxiv-p10.1">ἠ</span><span class="Greek" id="iv.xxxiv-p10.2">θικώτερον</span>.</p></note> with them,
but in order to appease and extinguish it: and not only by
enduring nobly, but also by soothing and comforting, do they cure
the sore and heal the wound of passion.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiv-p11">“Envieth not.” For it is possible for one to
be both long-suffering and envious, and thereby that excellency is
spoiled. But love avoids this also.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiv-p12">“Vaunteth not itself;” i.e., is not rash<note place="end" n="203" id="iv.xxxiv-p12.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxiv-p13"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxxiv-p13.1">οὐ προπετεύεται</span>.
Theod. in loc. gives the word the same turn. “She inquires not
into matters which concern her not, (for that is <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxxiv-p13.2"> τὸ περπερεύσθαι</span>,) she feels not about for the measures of
the Divine Substance, nor asks questions in His dispensations, as
some use to do. He that loveth, cannot endure to do any thing
rash.</p></note>. For it
renders him who loves both considerate, and grave, and steadfast.
In truth, one mark of those who love unlawfully is a defect in this
point. Whereas he to whom this love is known, is of all men the
most entirely freed from these evils. For when there is no anger
within, both rashness and insolence are clean taken away. Love,
like some excellent husbandman, taking her seat inwardly in the
soul and not suffering any of these thorns to spring up.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiv-p14">“Is not puffed up.” For so we see many who
think highly of themselves on the score of these very excellencies;
for example, on not being envious, nor grudging, nor mean-spirited,
nor rash: these evils being incidental not to wealth and poverty
only, but even to things naturally good. But love perfectly
purges out all. And consider: he that is long-suffering is not
of course also kind. But if he be not kind, the thing becomes a
vice, and he is in danger of falling into malice. Therefore she
supplies a medicine, I mean kindness, and preserves the virtue
pure. Again, the kind person often becomes over-complaisant; but
this also she corrects. For “love,” saith he, “vaunteth not
itself, is not puffed up:” the kind and long-suffering is often
ostentatious; but she takes away this vice also.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiv-p15">And see how he adorns her not only from what
she hath, but also from what she hath not. For he saith that she
both brings in virtue, and extirpates vice, nay rather she suffers
it not to spring up at all<note place="end" n="204" id="iv.xxxiv-p15.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxiv-p16"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxxiv-p16.1">τήν ἀρχὴν</span>, Saville.
<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxxiv-p16.2">τὴν ἀρετὴν</span>, Bened.</p></note>. Thus he said not, “She
envieth, indeed, but overcometh envy;” nor, “is arrogant, but
chastiseth that passion;” but, “envieth not, vaunteth not
itself, is not puffed up;” which truly is most to be admired,
that even without toil she accomplishes her good things, and
without war and battle-array her trophy is set up: she not
permitting him that possesseth her to toil and so to attain the
crown, but without labor conveying to him her prize. For where
there is not passion to contend against sober reason, what labor
can there be?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiv-p17">[2.] “Doth not behave itself unseemly.<note place="end" n="205" id="iv.xxxiv-p17.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxiv-p18"> Or, <i>doth not think herself treated
unseemly</i>. Theod. in loc. “There is no mean or lowly thing
which for the brethren’s sake she refuses to do, under the notion
that to do so would be an unseemly thing.”</p></note>” “Nay,
why,” saith he, “do I say, she ‘is not puffed up,’ when she
is so far from that feeling, that in suffering the most shameful
things for him whom she loves, she doth not even count the thing an
unseemliness?” Again, he did not say, “she suffereth
unseemliness but beareth the shame nobly,” but, “she doth not
even entertain any sense at all of the shame.” For if the
lovers of money endure all manner of reproaches for the sake of
that sordid traffic of theirs, and far from hiding their faces, do
even exult in it: much more he that hath this praiseworthy love
will refuse nothing whatsoever for the safety’s sake of those
whom he loves: nay, nor will any thing that he can suffer shame
him.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiv-p19">And that we may not fetch our example from any thing
base, let us examine this same statement in its application to
Christ, and then we shall see the force of what hath been said.
For our Lord Jesus Christ was both spit upon and beaten with rods
by pitiful slaves; and not only did He not count it an
unseemliness, but He even exulted and called the thing glory; and
bringing in a robber and murderer with Himself before the rest into
paradise, and discoursing with a harlot, and this when the
standers-by all accused Him, He counted not the thing to <pb n="196" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_196.html" id="iv.xxxiv-Page_196" />be disgraceful, but both allowed her
to kiss His feet, and to bedew His body with her tears, and to wipe
them away with her hair, and this amid a company of spectators who
were foes and enemies; “for love doeth nothing unseemly.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiv-p20">Therefore also fathers, though they be the first of
philosophers and orators, are not ashamed to lisp with their
children; and none of those who see them find fault with them, but
the thing is esteemed so good and right as to be even worthy of
prayer. And again, should they become vicious, the parents keep
on correcting, caring for them, abridging the reproaches they
incur, and are not ashamed. For love “doth nothing unseemly,”
but as it were with certain golden wings covereth up all the
offences of the beloved.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiv-p21">Thus also Jonathan loved David; and hearing his
father say, (<scripRef passage="1 Sam. xx. 30" id="iv.xxxiv-p21.1" parsed="|1Sam|20|30|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Sam.20.30">1 Sam. xx.
30</scripRef>.) “Thou son of
damsels that have run away from their homes<note place="end" n="206" id="iv.xxxiv-p21.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxiv-p22"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxxiv-p22.1">κορασίων
αὐτομολουσῶν</span>. Auth. “of the perverse and rebellious
woman.”</p></note>, thou womanly bred,<note place="end" n="207" id="iv.xxxiv-p22.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxiv-p23"> LXX, <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxxiv-p23.1">γυναικοτραφές</span>.</p></note>” he was
not ashamed, though the words be full of great reproach. For what
he means is this: “Thou son of mean harlots who are mad after
men, who run after the passers-by, thou unnerved and effeminate
wretch, who hast nothing of a man, but livest to the shame of
thyself and the mother who bare thee.” What then? Did he
grieve at these things, and hide his face, and turn away from his
beloved? Nay, quite the contrary; he displayed his fondness as an
ornament. And yet the one was at that time a king, and a king’s
son, even Jonathan; the other a fugitive and a wanderer, I mean,
David. But not even thus was he ashamed of his friendship.
“For love doth not behave itself unseemly. Yea, this is its
wonderful quality that not only it suffers not the injured to
grieve and feel galled, but even disposes him to rejoice.
Accordingly, he too, of whom we are speaking, after all these
things, just as though he had a crown put on him, went away and
fell on David’s neck. For love knows not what sort of thing
shame may be. Therefore it glories in those things for which
another hides his face. Since the shame is, not to know how to
love; not, when thou lovest, to incur danger and endure all for the
beloved.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiv-p24">But when I say, “all,” do not suppose I mean
things injurious also; for example, assisting a youth in a love
affair, or whatsoever hurtful thing any one may beseech another to
do for him. For such a person doth not love, and this I showed
you lately from the Egyptian woman: since in truth he only is the
lover who seeks what is profitable to the beloved: so that if any
pursue not this, even what is right and good, though he make ten
thousand professions of love, he is more hostile than any
enemies.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiv-p25">So also Rebecca aforetime, because she
exceedingly clung to her son, both perpetrated a theft, and was not
ashamed of detection, neither was she afraid, though the risk was
no common one; but even when her son raised scruples<note place="end" n="208" id="iv.xxxiv-p25.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxiv-p26"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxxiv-p26.1">ἁ</span><span class="Greek" id="iv.xxxiv-p26.2">κριβολογουμένου</span>, “made some minute
objection.”</p></note> to her,
“upon me be thy curse, my son,” she said. Dost thou see even
in a woman the soul of the Apostle<note place="end" n="209" id="iv.xxxiv-p26.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxiv-p27"> This view of Rebecca’s conduct is generally
sanctioned by the Fathers: so St. Augustin: “That which Jacob
did by direction of his mother so as to appear to deceive his
father, if you consider it diligently and faithfully, ‘non est
mendacium sed mysterium.’ And if we term that sort of thing a
lie, by the same rule we must also account as lies all parables and
figures whatsoever.” <i>contr. Mendac. ad Consentium</i>, c.
24. St. Ambrose, (<i>de Jacob et vita beata</i>, ii. 6.) “In
the mind of that pious mother the mystery overweighed the tie of
affection. She was not so much preferring Jacob to his brother,
as offering him to the Lord, who, she knew, had power to preserve
the gift presented unto Him.” This seems to mean that in
consecrating Jacob to be the first-born, she knowingly separated
him from herself, and so made a greater sacrifice. S. Chrys.
himself says, “Rebecca did this not of her own mind, but in
obedience to the divine oracle,” (on <i>Gen</i>. Hom. liii. 1.
414.) And he proceeds to point out God’s hand in certain minute
details of the transaction. It appears from St. Jerome, (1.169.)
that Hippolytus, Irenæus’ disciple, early in the third century,
took the same view. St. Gregory Nazianzen seems to be the only
writer who has left a contrary judgment on record: saying, “he
pursued a noble object by ignoble means.” The general result of
the reflections of the Fathers on the subject seems to be, that as
where we have God’s express command or approbation, we are sure
of the rectitude of what would otherwise be wrong, so there may be
circumstances rendering such command or approbation more or less
“probable,” which ought at least to stay us from censure: and
that marked providential interference, and mysterious allusion,
throughout, are to be considered as such circumstances.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiv-p28">[In the foregoing note the translator
has correctly stated the patristic view of Rebecca’s conduct, a
view which most moderns heartily reject as dishonoring to God and
of evil influence upon his people. But while we cannot with
Chrysostom cite the wife of Jacob as an example of love, yet there
is some extenuation for her. The case is neatly stated by the
Bishop of Ely in the Speaker’s Commentary. “Rebekah had no
doubt treasured up the oracle which had assured her, even before
their birth, that her younger son Jacob whom she loved should bear
rule over Esau, whose wild and reckless life and whose Canaanitish
wives had been a bitterness of soul to her. She probably knew
that Jacob had bought Esau’s birthright. Now believing rightly
that the father’s benediction would surely bring blessing with
it, she fears that these promises and hopes would fail. She
believed but not with that faith which can patiently abide till God
works out his plans by His providence. So she strove, as it were,
to force forward the event by unlawful means; even, as some have
thought that Judas betrayed Christ that he might free Him to
declare Himself a king and take the kingdom.” Every character
in the history comes in for some share of blame, but the greatest
seems due to her who originated the whole plot, who swept away the
scruples of her favorite son, and taught him to perpetrate the
boldest fraud and falsehood upon his venerable father. The
overweening idolatrous affection which led to such doings is very
different from the love which the Apostle inculcates and praises.
C.]</p></note> how, even as Paul chose, (if one
may compare a small thing with a great,) to be anathema for the
Jews’ sake, (<scripRef passage="Rom. ix. 3" id="iv.xxxiv-p28.1" parsed="|Rom|9|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.9.3">Rom.
ix. 3</scripRef>.) so also she, that
her son might be blessed, chose to be no less than accursed. And
the good things she gave up to him, for she was not, it seems, to
be blessed with him, but the evils she was prepared to endure
herself alone: nevertheless, she rejoiced, and hasted, and this
where so great a danger lay before her, and she was grieved at the
delay of the business: for she feared lest Esau might anticipate
them and render her wisdom vain. Wherefore also she cuts short
the conversation and urges on the young man, and just permitting
him to answer what had been said, states a 
<pb n="197" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_197.html" id="iv.xxxiv-Page_197" />reason sufficient to persuade him. For she said
not, “thou sayest these things without reason, and in vain thou
fearest, thy father having grown old and being deprived of
clearness of sight:” but what? “upon me be thy curse, my
son. Only do thou not mar the plot, nor lose the object of our
chase, nor give up the treasure.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiv-p29">And this very Jacob, served he not for wages with
his kinsmen twice seven years? Was he not together with the
bondage subject to mockery in respect of that trick? What then? 
Did he feel the mockery? Did he count it behaving himself
unseemly, that being a freeman, and free born, and well brought up,
he endured slaves’ treatment among his own kinsmen: a thing
which is wont to be most vexing, when one receives opprobrious
treatment from one’s friends? In no wise. And the cause was
his love, which made the time, though long, appear short. “For
they were,” saith he, (<scripRef passage="Gen. xxix. 20" id="iv.xxxiv-p29.1" parsed="|Gen|29|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.29.20">Gen. xxix. 20</scripRef>.) “in his sight as a few
days.” So far was he from being galled and blushing for this
his bondage. Justly then said the blessed Paul, “Love doth not
behave itself unseemly.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiv-p30">[3.] 1.
“Seeketh not its own, is not provoked.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiv-p31">Thus having said, “doth not behave itself
unseemly,” he showeth also the temper of mind, on account of
which she doth not behave herself unseemly.   And what is that
temper? That she “seeketh not her own.” For the beloved she
esteems to be all, and then only “behaveth herself unseemly,”
when she cannot free him from such unseemliness; so that if it be
possible by her own unseemliness to benefit her beloved, she doth
not so much as count the thing unseemliness; for the other party
thereafter is yourself, when you love<note place="end" n="210" id="iv.xxxiv-p31.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxiv-p32"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxxiv-p32.1">ἐ</span><span class="Greek" id="iv.xxxiv-p32.2">κεῖνος γὰρ αὐτός ἐστι λοιπόν</span>.</p></note>: since this is friendship, that
the lover and the beloved should no longer be two persons divided,
but in a manner one single person; a thing which no how takes place
except from love. Seek not therefore thine own, that thou mayest
find thine own. For he that seeks his own, finds not his own.
Wherefore also Paul said, “Let no man seek his own, but each his
neighbor’s good.” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. x. 24" id="iv.xxxiv-p32.3" parsed="|1Cor|10|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.10.24">1 Cor. x. 24</scripRef>.) For your own profit lies
in the profit of your neighbor, and his in yours. As therefore
one that had his own gold buried in the house of his neighbor,
should he refuse to go and there seek and dig it up, will never
seek it; so likewise here, he that will not seek his own profit in
the advantage of his neighbor, will not attain unto the crowns due
to this: God Himself having therefore so disposed of it, in order
that we should be mutually bound together: and even as one
awakening a slumbering child to follow his brother, when he is of
himself unwilling, places in the brother’s hand that which he
desires and longs for, that through desire of obtaining it he may
pursue after him that holds it, and accordingly so it takes
place: thus also here, each man’s own profit hath he given to
his neighbor, that hence we may run after one another, and not be
torn asunder.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiv-p33">And if thou wilt, see this also in our case who
address you. For my profit depends on thee, and thy advantage on
me. Thus, on the one hand it profits thee to be taught the things
that please God, but with this have I been entrusted, that thou
mightest receive it from me, and therefore mightest be compelled to
run unto me; and on the other hand it profits me that thou
shouldest be made better: for the reward which I shall receive
for this will be great; but this again lieth in thee; and therefore
am I compelled to follow after thee that thou mayest be better, and
that I may receive my profit from thee. Wherefore also Paul
saith, “For what is my hope? are not even ye?” And again,
“My hope, and my joy, and the crown of my rejoicing.” (<scripRef passage="1 Thess. ii. 19" id="iv.xxxiv-p33.1" parsed="|1Thess|2|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Thess.2.19">1 Thess. ii. 19</scripRef>.) So that the joy of Paul
was the disciples, and his joy they had. Therefore he even wept
when he saw them perishing.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiv-p34">Again their profit depended on Paul: wherefore he
said, “For the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.
(<scripRef passage="Acts xxviii. 20" id="iv.xxxiv-p34.1" parsed="|Acts|28|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.28.20">Acts xxviii. 20</scripRef>.) And
again, “These things I endure for the elect’s sakes that they
may obtain eternal life. (<scripRef passage="2 Tim. ii. 10" id="iv.xxxiv-p34.2" parsed="|2Tim|2|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Tim.2.10">2 Tim. ii. 10</scripRef>.) And this one may see in
worldly things. “For the wife,” saith he, “hath not power
over her own body, nor yet the husband; but the wife over the
husband’s, and the husband over the wife’s.” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. vii. 4" id="iv.xxxiv-p34.3" parsed="|1Cor|7|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.7.4">1 Cor. vii. 4</scripRef>.) So likewise we, when we
wish to bind any together, do this. We leave neither of them in
his own power, but extending a chain between them, we cause the one
to be holden of the other, and the other of the one. Wilt thou
also see this in the case of governors? He that judges sits not
in judgment for himself, but seeking the profit of his neighbor.
The governed on the other hand, seek the profit of the governor by
their attendance, by their ministry, by all the other things.
Soldiers take up their arms for us, for on our account they peril
themselves. We for them are in straits; for from us are their
supplies.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiv-p35">But if thou sayest, “each one doth this seeking
his own,” this also say I, but I add, that by the good of another
one’s own is won. Thus both the soldier, unless he fight for
them that support him, hath none that ministers to him for this
end: and this same on the other hand, unless he nourish the
soldier, hath none to arm himself in his behalf.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiv-p36">[4.] Seest thou love, how it is everywhere ex<pb n="198" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_198.html" id="iv.xxxiv-Page_198" />tended and manages all things? But
be not weary, until thou have thoroughly acquainted thyself with
this golden chain. For having said, “seeketh not her own,” he
mentions again the good things produced by this. And what are
these?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiv-p37">“Is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil.<note place="end" n="211" id="iv.xxxiv-p37.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxiv-p38"> [The revised version renders this clause, “taketh
not account of evil”—a rendering as old as Theodoret. C.]</p></note>” See
love again not only subduing vice, but not even suffering it to
arise at all. For he said not, “though provoked, she
overcomes,” but, “is not provoked.” And he said not,
“worketh no evil,” but, “not even thinketh;” i.e., so far
from contriving any evil, she doth not even suspect it of the
beloved. How then could she work any, or how be provoked? who
doth not even endure to admit an evil surmise; whence is the
fountain of wrath.</p>

“Rejoiceth not in unrighteousness:” i.e., doth not feel
pleasure over those that suffer ill: and not this only, but also,
what is much greater, “rejoiceth with the truth.” “She
feels pleasure,” saith he, “with them that are well spoken
of,” as Paul saith, “Rejoice with them that rejoice, and weep
with them that weep.” (<scripRef passage="Rom. xii. 15" id="iv.xxxiv-p39.2" parsed="|Rom|12|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.12.15">Rom. xii. 15</scripRef>.)</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiv-p40">Hence, she “envieth not,” hence she “is
not puffed up:” since in fact she accounts the good things<note place="end" n="212" id="iv.xxxiv-p40.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxiv-p41"> Fronto Ducæus reads <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxxiv-p41.1"> κακά</span>.</p></note> of others
her own.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiv-p42">Seest thou how by degrees love makes her nursling an
angel? For when he is void of anger, and pure from envy, and free
from every tyrannical passion, consider that even from the nature
of man he is delivered from henceforth, and hath arrived at the
very serenity of angels.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiv-p43">Nevertheless, he is not content with these, but hath
something even more than these to say: according to his plan of
stating the stronger points later. Wherefore he saith, “beareth
all things.” From her long-suffering, from her goodness;
whether they be burdensome, or grievous, or insults, or stripes, or
death, or whatsoever else. And this again one may perceive from
the case of blessed David. For what could be more intolerable
than to see a son rising up against him, and aiming at the
usurpation, and thirsting for a father’s blood? Yet this did
that blessed one endure, nor even so could he bear to throw out one
bitter expression against the parricide; but even when he left all
the rest to his captains, gave a strong injunction respecting his
safety. For strong was the foundation of his love. Wherefore
also it “beareth all things.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiv-p44">Now its power the Apostle here intimates, but its
goodness, by what follows. For, “it hopeth all things,” saith
he, “believeth all things, endureth all things.” What is,
“hopeth all things?” It doth not despair,” saith he, “of
the beloved, but even though he be worthless, it continues to
correct, to provide, to care for him.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiv-p45">“Believeth all things.” “For it doth not
merely hope,” saith he, “but also believeth from its great
affection.” And even if these good things should not turn out
according to its hope, but the other person should prove yet more
intolerable, it bears even these. For, saith he, it “endureth
all things.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiv-p46">[5.] <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 13.8" id="iv.xxxiv-p46.1" parsed="|1Cor|13|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.13.8">Ver. 8</scripRef>. “Love never

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiv-p47">Seest thou when he put the crown on the arch, and
what of all things is peculiar to this gift? For what is,
“faileth not?” it is not severed, is not dissolved by
endurance. For it puts up with everything: since happen what
will, he that loves never can hate. This then is the greatest of
its excellencies.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiv-p48">Such a person was Paul. Wherefore also he said,
“If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my
flesh;” (<scripRef passage="Rom. xi. 14" id="iv.xxxiv-p48.1" parsed="|Rom|11|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.11.14">Rom. xi.

continued hoping. And to Timothy he gave a charge, saying, “And
the Lord’s servant must not strive, but be gentle towards
all.…in meekness correcting those that oppose themselves, if God
peradventure may give them the knowledge of the truth.<note place="end" n="213" id="iv.xxxiv-p48.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxiv-p49"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxxiv-p49.1">μετάνοιαν εἰς</span> om.</p></note>”

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiv-p50">“What then,” saith one, “if they be enemies
and heathens, must one hate them?” One must hate, not them but
their doctrine: not the man, but the wicked conduct, the corrupt
mind. For the man is God’s work, but the deceit is the
devil’s work. Do thou not therefore confound the things of God
and the things of the devil. Since the Jews were both
blasphemers, and persecutors, and injurious, and spake ten thousand
evil things of Christ. Did Paul then hate them, he who of all men
most loved Christ? In no wise, but he both loved them, and did
everything for their sakes: and at one time he saith, “My
heart’s desire and my supplication to God is for them that they
may be saved:” (<scripRef passage="Rom. x. 1; ix. 3" id="iv.xxxiv-p50.1" parsed="|Rom|10|1|0|0;|Rom|9|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.10.1 Bible:Rom.9.3">Rom.

anathema from Christ for their sakes.” Thus also Ezekiel seeing
them slain saith, “Alas, O Lord, dost Thou blot out the remnant
of Israel?” (<scripRef passage="Ezek. ix. 8" id="iv.xxxiv-p50.2" parsed="|Ezek|9|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ezek.9.8">Ezek. ix.

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiv-p51">Why then saith David, “Do not I hate them, O Lord,
that hate Thee, and against Thine enemies did I not pine away? I
hate them with perfect hatred.” (<scripRef passage="Ps. cxxxix. 21, 22" id="iv.xxxiv-p51.1" parsed="|Ps|139|21|139|22" osisRef="Bible:Ps.139.21-Ps.139.22">Ps. cxxxix. 21, 22</scripRef>.)</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiv-p52">Now, in the first place, not all things spoken in
the Psalms by David, are spoken in the person of David. For it is
he himself who saith, “I have dwelt in the tents of Kedar;”
(<scripRef passage="Ps. cxx. 5" id="iv.xxxiv-p52.1" parsed="|Ps|120|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.120.5">Ps. cxx. 5</scripRef>.) and, “By the waters of
Babylon, there we sat <pb n="199" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_199.html" id="iv.xxxiv-Page_199" />down and
wept:” (<scripRef passage="Psa. 137.1" id="iv.xxxiv-p52.2" parsed="|Ps|137|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.137.1">cxxxvii. 1</scripRef>.) yet he neither saw Babylon,
nor the tents of Kedar.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiv-p53">But besides this, we require now a completer
self-command. Wherefore also when the disciples besought that
fire might come down, even as in the case of Elias, “Ye know
not,” saith Christ, “what manner of spirit ye are of. (<scripRef passage="Luke ix. 55" id="iv.xxxiv-p53.1" parsed="|Luke|9|55|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.9.55">Luke ix. 55</scripRef>.) For at that time not the
ungodliness only, but also the ungodly themselves, they were
commanded to hate, in order that their friendship might not prove
an occasion of transgression unto them. Therefore he severed
their connections, both by blood and marriage, and on every side he
fenced them off.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiv-p54">But now because he hath brought us to a more entire
self-command and set us on high above that mischief, he bids us
rather admit and soothe them. For we get no harm from them, but
they get good by us. What then doth he say? we must not hate, but
pity. Since if thou shalt hate, how wilt thou easily convert him
that is in error? how wilt thou pray for the unbeliever? for that
one ought to pray, hear what Paul saith: “I exhort therefore,
first of all, that supplications, prayer, intercessions,
thanksgivings be made for all men.” (<scripRef passage="1 Tim. ii. 1" id="iv.xxxiv-p54.1" parsed="|1Tim|2|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.2.1">1 Tim. ii. 1</scripRef>.) But that all were not then
believers, is, I suppose, evident unto every one. And again,
“for kings and all that are in high place.” But that these
were ungodly and transgressors, this also is equally manifest.
Further, mentioning also the reason for the prayer, he adds, “for
this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour; who
willeth that all men should be saved, and come to the knowledge of
the truth.” Therefore, if he find a Gentile wife consorting
with a believer, he dissolves not the marriage. Yet what is more
closely joined than a man to his wife? “For they two shall be
one flesh,” (<scripRef passage="Gen. ii. 24" id="iv.xxxiv-p54.2" parsed="|Gen|2|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.2.24">Gen. ii.
24</scripRef>.) and great in that
instance is the charm, and ardent the desire. But if we are to
hate ungodly and lawless men, we shall go on to hate also sinners;
and thus in regular process thou wilt be broken off from the most
even of thy brethren, or rather from all: for there is not one,
no, not one, without sin. For if it be our duty to hate the
enemies of God, one must not hate the ungodly only, but also
sinners: and thus we shall be worse than wild beasts, shunning
all, and puffed up with pride; even as that Pharisee. But not
thus did Paul command us, but how? “Admonish the disorderly,
encourage the faint-hearted, support the weak, be long suffering
toward all.” (<scripRef passage="1 Thess. v. 14" id="iv.xxxiv-p54.3" parsed="|1Thess|5|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Thess.5.14">1 Thess.
v. 14</scripRef>.)</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiv-p55">[6.] What then doth he mean when he saith, “If
any obeyeth not our word by this epistle, note that man, that ye
have no company with him?” (<scripRef passage="2 Thess. iii. 14" id="iv.xxxiv-p55.1" parsed="|2Thess|3|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Thess.3.14">2 Thess. iii. 14</scripRef>.) In the first place, he
saith this of brethren, however not even so without limitation, but
this too with gentleness. For do not thou cut off what follows,
but subjoin also the next clause: how, having said, “keep no
company,” he added, “yet count him not as an enemy, but
admonish him as a brother.” Seest thou how he bade us hate the
deed that is evil, and not the man? For indeed it is the work of
the devil to tear us asunder from one another, and he hath ever
used great diligence to take away love that he may cut off the way
of correction, and may retain him in error and thee in enmity, and
thus block up the way of his salvation. For when both the
physician hates the sick man and flies from him, and the sick man
turns away from the physician, when will the distempered person be
restored, seeing that neither the one will call in the other’s
aid, nor will the other go to him?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiv-p56">But wherefore, tell me, dost thou at all turn away
from him and avoid him? Because he is ungodly? Truly for this
cause oughtest thou to welcome and attend him, that thou mayest
raise him up in his sickness. But if he be incurably sick, still
thou hast been bidden to do thy part. Since Judas also was
incurably diseased, yet God left not off attending upon him.
Wherefore, neither do thou grow weary. For even if after much
labor thou fail to deliver him from his ungodliness, yet shalt thou
receive the deliverer’s reward, and wilt cause him to wonder at
thy gentleness, and so all this praise will pass on to God. For
though thou shouldest work wonders, and raise the dead, and
whatsoever work thou doest, the Heathen will never wonder at thee
so much, as when they see thee displaying a meek, gentle, mild
disposition. And this is no small achievement: since many will
even be entirely delivered from their evil way; there being nothing
that hath such power to allure men as love. For in respect of the
former they will rather be jealous of thee, I mean the signs and
wonders; but for this they will both admire and love thee: and if
they love, they will also lay hold of the truth in due course. If
however he become not all at once a believer, wonder not nor hurry
on, neither do thou require all things at once, but suffer him for
the present to praise, and love, and unto this in due course he
will come.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiv-p57">[7.] And that thou mayest clearly know how great a
thing this is, hear how even Paul, going before an unbelieving
judge, made his defence. “I think myself happy,” saith he,
“That I am to make my defence before thee.” (<scripRef passage="Acts xxvi. 2" id="iv.xxxiv-p57.1" parsed="|Acts|26|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.26.2">Acts xxvi. 2</scripRef>.) And these things he said,
not to flatter him, far from it; but wishing to gain him by his
gentleness. And he did in part gain him, and he that was till
then considered to be condemned took captive his judge, and the
victory is confessed by the person himself who was <pb n="200" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_200.html" id="iv.xxxiv-Page_200" />made captive, with a loud voice in
the presence of all, saying, “With but little persuasion thou
wouldst fain make me a Christian.” (<scripRef passage="Acts xxvi. 28, 29" id="iv.xxxiv-p57.2" parsed="|Acts|26|28|26|29" osisRef="Bible:Acts.26.28-Acts.26.29">Acts xxvi. 28, 29</scripRef>.) What then saith Paul? He
spread his net the wider, and saith, “I would to God, that not
only thou, but also all that hear me this day, might become such as
I am, except these bonds.” What sayest thou, O Paul? “except
these bonds?” And what confidence remains for thee, if thou art
ashamed of these things, and fliest from them, and this before so
great a multitude? Dost thou not every where in thy Epistles
boast of this matter, and call thyself a prisoner? Dost thou not
every where carry about this chain in our sight as a diadem? What
then hath happened now that thou deprecatest these bonds? “I
myself deprecate them not,” saith he, “nor am I ashamed of
them, but I condescend to their weakness. For they are not yet
able to receive my glorying; and I have learned from my Lord not to
put ‘a piece of undressed cloth upon an old garment:’ (S.
<scripRef passage="Matt. ix. 16" id="iv.xxxiv-p57.3" parsed="|Matt|9|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.9.16">Matt. ix. 16</scripRef>.) therefore did I thus
speak. For, in fact, unto this time they have heard ill reports
of our doctrine, and abhor the cross. If therefore I should add
also bonds, their hatred becometh greater; I removed these,
therefore, that the other might be made acceptable. So it is,
that to them it seems disgraceful to be bound, because they have
not as yet tasted of the Glory which is with us. One must
therefore condescend: and when they shall have learned of the
true life, then will they know the beauty also of this iron, and
the lustre which comes of these bonds.” Furthermore,
discoursing with others, he even calls the thing a free gift,
saying, “It hath been granted in the behalf of Christ, not only
to believe on Him, but also to suffer in His behalf.” (<scripRef passage="Philip. i. 29" id="iv.xxxiv-p57.4" parsed="|Phil|1|29|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Phil.1.29">Philip. i. 29</scripRef>.) But for the time then
present, it was a great thing for the hearers not to be ashamed of
the cross: for which cause he goes on gradually. Thus, neither
doth any one introducing a person to a palace, before that he
beholds the vestibule, compel him, yet standing without, to survey
what is within: since in that way it will not even seem
admirable, unless one enter in and so acquaint one’s self with
all.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiv-p58">So then let us also deal with the heathen sort: 
with condecension, with love. For love is a great teacher, and
able both to withdraw men from error, and to reform the character,
and to lead them by the hand unto self-denial, and out of stones to
make men.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiv-p59">[8.] And if thou wouldest learn her power,
bring me a man timid and fearful of every sound, and trembling at
shadows; or passionate, and harsh, and a wild beast rather than a
man; or wanton and licentious; or wholly given to wickedness; and
deliver him into the hands of love, and introduce him into this
school; and thou wilt speedily see that cowardly and timid creature
made brave and magnanimous, and venturing upon all things
cheerfully. And what is wonderful, not from any change in nature
do these things result, but in the coward soul itself love
manifests her peculiar power; and it is much the same as if one
should cause a leaden sword, not turned into steel but continuing
in the nature of lead, to do the work of steel. As thus: Jacob
was a “plain man<note place="end" n="214" id="iv.xxxiv-p59.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxiv-p60"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxxiv-p60.1">ᾶ</span><span class="Greek" id="iv.xxxiv-p60.2">πλαστος</span>.</p></note>, (<scripRef passage="Gen. xxv. 27" id="iv.xxxiv-p60.3" parsed="|Gen|25|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.25.27">Gen. xxv. 27</scripRef>.) dwelling in a house<note place="end" n="215" id="iv.xxxiv-p60.4"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxiv-p61"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxxiv-p61.1">οἰκίαν</span>. LXX. rec.
vers. “tents.”</p></note>, and
unpracticed in toils and dangers, living a kind of remiss and easy
life, and like a virgin in her chamber, so also he was compelled
for the most part to sit within doors and keep the house; withdrawn
from the forum and all tumults of the forum, and from all such
matters, and even continuing in ease and quietness. What then? 
After that the torch of love had set him on fire, see how it made
this plain and home-keeping man strong to endure and fond of
toil. And of this hear not what I say, but what the patriarch
himself saith: how finding fault with his kinsman, his words are,
“These twenty years am I with thee.” (<scripRef passage="Gen. xxxi. 36" id="iv.xxxiv-p61.2" parsed="|Gen|31|36|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.31.36">Gen. xxxi. 36</scripRef>.) And how wert thou these
twenty years? (For this also he adds,) “Consumed by the heat in
the day time, and with the frost by night, and sleep departed from
mine eyes.” Thus speaks that “plain man, keeping at home,”
and living that easy life.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiv-p62">Again, that he was timid is evident, in that,
expecting to see Esau, he was dead with fear. But see again, how
this timid man became bolder than a lion under the influence of
love. For putting himself forward like some champion before the
rest, he was ready to be first in receiving that savage and
slaughter-breathing brother as he supposed him to be, and with his
own body to purchase the safety of his wives: and him whom he
feared and shuddered at, he desired to behold himself foremost in
the array. For this fear was not so strong as his affection for
his wives. Seest thou how, being timid, he became suddenly
adventurous, not by changing his character, but being invigorated
by love? For that after this also he was timid, is evident by his
changing from place to place.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiv-p63">But let no man consider what has been said to be a
charge against that righteous man: since being timid is no
reproach, for this is a man’s nature; but the doing any thing
unseemly for timidity’s sake. For it is possible for one that
is timid by nature to become courageous through piety. What did
Moses? Did he not, through fear of a single Egyptian, fly, and go
away into banishment? Nevertheless, this fugitive who could not
endure the menace <pb n="201" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_201.html" id="iv.xxxiv-Page_201" />of a single
man, after that he tasted of the honey of love, nobly and without
compulsion from any man, was forward to perish together with them
whom he loved. “For if thou wilt forgive their sin,” saith
he, “forgive; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of Thy book
which thou hast written. (<scripRef passage="Exod. xxxii. 32" id="iv.xxxiv-p63.1" parsed="|Exod|32|32|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Exod.32.32">Exod. xxxii. 32</scripRef>.)</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiv-p64">[9.] Moreover, that love makes also the fierce
moderate, and the wanton chaste, we have no longer need of any
examples: this being evident to all men. Though a man be more
savage than any wild beast, no sheep so gentle as he is rendered by
love. Thus, what could be more savage and frantic than Saul? 
But when his daughter let his enemy go, he uttered not against her
even a bitter word. And he that unsparingly put to the sword all
the priests for David’s sake, seeing that his daughter had sent
him away from the house, was not indignant with her even as far as
words; and this when so great a fraud had been contrived against
him: because he was restrained by the stronger bridle of
love.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiv-p65">Now as moderation, so chastity, is an ordinary
effect of love. If a man love his own wife as he ought to love,
even though he be never so much inclined to wantoness, he will not
endure to look upon another woman, on account of his affection for
her. “For love,” (<scripRef passage="Song of Sol. 8.5" id="iv.xxxiv-p65.1" parsed="|Song|8|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Song.8.5">Cant. viii. 5</scripRef>.) saith one, “is strong as
death.” So that from no other source doth wanton behavior arise
than from want of love.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxiv-p66">Since then love is the Artificer of all virtue, let
us with all exactness implant her in our own souls, that she may
produce for us many blessings, and that we may have her fruit
continually abounding, the fruit which is ever fresh and never
decays. For thus shall we obtain no less than eternal
blessings: which may we all obtain, through the grace and mercy
of our Lord Jesus Christ, with Whom to the Father, and also the
Holy Ghost, be glory, power, and honor, now and for ever, and world
without end. Amen.</p>

<p class="c27" id="iv.xxxv-p3">But whether there be prophecies, they shall be done

knowledge, it shall be done away.</p>

<p class="c24" id="iv.xxxv-p4"><span class="c18" id="iv.xxxv-p4.1">Having</span> shown the excellency
of love from its being requisite both to the spiritual gifts, and
to the virtues of life; and from rehearsal of all its good
qualities, and by showing it to be the foundation of exact
self-denial; from another, a third head, again he points out its
worth. And this he doth, first from a wish to persuade those who
seemed to be accounted inferior that it is in their power to have
the chief of all signs, and that they will be no worse off than the
possessors of the gifts, if they have this, but rather much
better: secondly, with regard on the other hand to them that had
the greater gifts and were lifted up thereby, studying to bring
them down and to show that they have nothing unless they have
this. For thus they would both love one another, envy as well as
pride being hereby taken away; and reciprocally, loving one
another, they would still further banish these passions. “For
love envieth not, is not puffed up.” So that on every side he
throws around them an impregnable wall, and a manifold unanimity,
which first removes all their disorders, and thereby again waxes
stronger. Therefore also he put forward innumerable reasons which
might comfort their dejection. As thus: both “the same
Spirit,” saith he, is the giver; and He “giveth to profit
withal; and divideth as he will,” and it is a gift which He
divideth, not a debt. Though thou receive but a little, thou dost
equally contribute to the body, and even thus thou enjoyest much
honor. And he that hath the greater, needs thee who hast the
less. And, “Love is the greatest gift, and ‘the more
excellent way.’”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxv-p5">Now all this he said doubly to bind them to each
other, both by their not considering themselves disparaged while
they had this; and because, after pursuit and attainment of it,
they henceforth would not feel human infirmity; both as having the
root of all gifts, and as no longer capable of contentiousness even
though they had nothing. For he that is once led captive by love
is freed from contentiousness.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxv-p6">And this is why, pointing out to them how great
advantages they shall thence reap, he sketched out its fruits; by
his praises of it repressing their disorders: inasmuch as each
one of the things mentioned by him was a sufficient medicine to
heal their wounds. Wherefore also he said, “suffereth long,”
to them that <pb n="202" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_202.html" id="iv.xxxv-Page_202" />are at strife one
with another; “is kind,” to them that stand mutually aloof, and
bear a secret grudge; “envieth not,” to them that look
grudgingly on their superiors; “vaunteth not itself,” to them
that are separated; “is not puffed up,” to them that boast
themselves against others; “doth not behave itself unseemly,”
to them that do not think it their duty to condescend; “seeketh
not her own,” to them that overlook the rest; “is not provoked,
taketh not account of evil,” to them that are insolent;
“rejoiceth not in unrighteousness, but rejoiceth with the
truth,” to them again that are envious; “beareth all things,”
to them that are treacherous; “hopeth all things,” to the
despairing; “endureth all things, never faileth,” to them that
easily separate themselves.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxv-p7">[2.] Now then after that in every way he had
shown her to be very exceedingly great, again he doth so from
another most important head, by a fresh comparison exalting her
dignity, and saying thus; “but whether there be prophecies, they
shall be done away; whether there be tongues, they shall
cease.” For if both these were brought in in order to the
faith; when that is every where sown abroad, the use of these is
henceforth superfluous. But the loving one another shall not
cease, rather it shall even advance further, both here and
hereafter, and then more than now. For here there are many things
that weaken<note place="end" n="216" id="iv.xxxv-p7.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxv-p8"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxxv-p8.1">χαυνοῦντα</span>.</p></note> our love;
wealth, business, passions of the body, disorders of the soul; but
there none of these.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxv-p9">But although it be no marvel that prophecies and
tongues should be done away, that knowledge should be done away,
this is what may cause some perplexity. For this also he added,
“Whether there be knowledge, it shall be done away.” What
then? are we then to live in ignorance? Far from it. Nay, then
specially it is probable that our knowledge is made intense.
Wherefore also he said, “Then shall I know, even as also I am
known.” For this reason, if you mark it, that you might not
suppose this to be done away equally with the prophecy and the
tongues, having said, “Whether there be knowledge, it shall be
done away,” he was not silent, but added also the manner of its
vanishing away, immediately subjoining the saying,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxv-p10"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 13.9,10" id="iv.xxxv-p10.1" parsed="|1Cor|13|9|13|10" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.13.9-1Cor.13.10">Ver. 9. 10</scripRef>. “We know in part, and we
prophesy in part. But when that which is perfect is come, then
that which is in part shall be done away.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxv-p11">It is not therefore knowledge that is done away, but
the circumstance that our knowledge is in part. For we shall not
only know as much but even a great deal more. But that I may also
make it plain by example; now we know that God is every where, but
how, we know not.  That He made out of things that are not the
things that are we know; but of the manner we are ignorant. That
He was born of a virgin, we know; but how, we know not yet. But
then shall we know somewhat more and clearer concerning these
things. Next he points out also how great is the distance between
the two, and that our deficiency is no small one, saying,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxv-p12"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 13.11" id="iv.xxxv-p12.1" parsed="|1Cor|13|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.13.11">Ver. 11</scripRef>. “When I was a child, I
spake as a child, I felt as a child, I thought as a child; but now
that I am become a man, I have put away childish things.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxv-p13">And by another example too he manifests the same
thing again, saying,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxv-p14"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 13.12" id="iv.xxxv-p14.1" parsed="|1Cor|13|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.13.12">Ver. 12</scripRef>. “For now we see in
a mirror.” Further, because the glass sets before us the thing
seen indefinitely, he added, “darkly<note place="end" n="217" id="iv.xxxv-p14.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxv-p15"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxxv-p15.1">ἐν
αἰνίγματι</span>.</p></note>,” to show very strongly that the
present knowledge is most partial.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxv-p16">“But then face to face.”  Not as though God
hath a face, but to express the notion of greater clearness and
perspicuity. Seest thou how we learn all things by gradual
addition?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxv-p17">“Now I know in part; but then shall I know
even as also I have been known.” Seest thou how in two ways he
pulls down their pride? Both because their knowledge is in part,
and because not even this have they of themselves. “For I knew
Him not, but He made Himself known<note place="end" n="218" id="iv.xxxv-p17.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxv-p18"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxxv-p18.1">ἐ</span><span class="Greek" id="iv.xxxv-p18.2">γνώρισε</span>, made me know Him.</p></note> to me,” saith he. Wherefore,
even as now He first knew me, and Himself hastened towards me, so
shall I hasten towards Him then much more than now. For so he
that sits in darkness, as long as he sees not the sun doth not of
himself hasten to meet the beauty of its beam, which indeed shows
itself as soon as it hath begun to shine: but when he perceives
its brightness, then also himself at length follows after its
light: This then is the meaning of the expression, “even as
also I have been known.” Not that we shall so know him as He
is, but that even as He hastened toward us now, so also shall we
cleave unto Him then, and shall know many of the things which are
now secret, and shall enjoy that most blessed society and wisdom.
For if Paul who knew so much was a child, consider what those
things must be. If these be “a glass” and “a riddle,” do
thou hence again infer, God’s open Face, how great a thing It
is.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxv-p19">[3.] But that I may open out to thee some small
part of this difference, and may impart some faint ray of this
thought to thy soul, I would have thee recall to mind things as
they were in the Law, now after that grace hath shone forth. For
those things too, that came before grace, had a certain great and
marvellous <pb n="203" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_203.html" id="iv.xxxv-Page_203" />appearance: 
nevertheless, hear what Paul saith of them after grace came: 
“That which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by
reason of the glory that surpasseth.” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. iii. 10" id="iv.xxxv-p19.1" parsed="|2Cor|3|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.3.10">2 Cor. iii. 10</scripRef>.)</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxv-p20">But that what I say may be made yet clearer, let us
apply the argument to some one of the rites then performed, and
then thou wilt see how great is the difference. And if thou wilt,
let us bring forward that passover and this, and then shalt thou be
aware of our superiority. For the Jews indeed celebrated it, but
they celebrated it “so as in a mirror, and darkly.” But these
hidden mysteries they never at any time did even conceive in their
mind, nor what things they prefigured. They saw a lamb slain, and
the blood of a beast, and door-posts sprinkled with it; but that
the Son of God incarnate shall be slain, and shall set free the
whole world, and shall grant both to Greeks and Barbarians to taste
of this Blood, and shall open heaven to all, and shall offer what
is there to the whole human race, and having taken His
blood-stained flesh shall exalt it above the heaven, and the heaven
of heavens, and, in a word, above all the hosts on high, of the
angels and archangels and all the other powers, and shall cause it
shining in unspeakable glory,—to sit down upon the throne itself
of the King, on the right hand of the Father these things, I say,
no one, either of them or of the rest of mankind, either foreknew
or was able ever to conceive.</p>

nothing?<note place="end" n="219" id="iv.xxxv-p21.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxv-p22"> The Heretics here referred to were the Eunomians or
Anomœans, so called from Eunomius their chief Teacher, (for Aetius
first promulgated their opinions,) and from their maintaining not
merely the inequality but the dissimilarity (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxxv-p22.1">τὸ
ἆνόμοιον</span>) of the Son’s nature to that of the Father.
By this he carried out Arianism, and made it more consistent and
more impious. It seems that he arbitrarily selected the term
<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxxv-p22.2">ἇγεννητὸς</span>,
“unbegotten,” as setting forth not merely the attribute of the
Father, but the very substance of the Godhead, and upon this
proceeded, of course, to deny the proper divinity of the Son,
because He was confessed to be <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxxv-p22.3"> γεννητὸς</span>, “begotten.” And he not only thus
implied, but expressly maintained, that knowing thus much of God,
we know His whole Nature: whence it followed, that St. Paul’s
professions of ignorance referred not to the Substance, but to some
parts of the Providence of God, called here, “dispensations.”
Against this result of Eunomius’ impiety, St. Chrysostom preached
the series of five Homilies, “On the Incomprehensible Nature of
God:” in the first of which, (t. vi. 393. ed. Saville,) he
argues on this passage almost in the same words. The same fallacy
may be seen refuted by St. Basil also, <i>Ep</i>. 234, 235; <i>
Epiph. Hær</i>. 76. p. 989, &amp;c.: Theodoret, ii. 418; and by
others. The whole doctrine as grounded on the word <span class="Greek" id="iv.xxxv-p22.4">ἇγεννητὸς</span> is exposed
at large by St. Basil in his five books against Eunomius, t. i. ed.
Bened. In the Appendix to that volume, Eunomius’s own treatise
is given. The whole forms a melancholy example, how men may
deceive themselves by following after simplification and logical
consistency, without due reverence for sacred things.</p></note>  That the
expression, “now I know in part,” is spoken in dispensations;
for that the Apostle had the perfect knowledge of God. And now he
calls himself a child? How sees he “in a mirror?” How
“darkly,” if he hath the sum of knowledge? And why doth he
refer to it as something peculiar to the Spirit, and to no other
power in the creation, saying, “For who among men knoweth the
things of a man, save the spirit of the man which is in him? Even
so the things of God none knoweth, save the Spirit of God.”
(<scripRef passage="1 Cor. ii. 11" id="iv.xxxv-p22.5" parsed="|1Cor|2|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.2.11">1 Cor. ii. 11</scripRef>.) And Christ again sayeth
that this belongs to Himself alone, thus saying, “Not that any
man hath seen the Father, save He which is from God, He hath seen
the Father,” (<scripRef passage="John vi. 46" id="iv.xxxv-p22.6" parsed="|John|6|46|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.6.46">John vi.
46</scripRef>.) giving the name,
“sight,” to the most clear and perfect knowledge.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxv-p23">And how shall he who knoweth the Essence, be
ignorant of the dispensations? since that knowledge is greater than
this.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxv-p24">“Are we then,” saith he, “ignorant of
God?” Far from it. That He is, we know, but what He is, as
regards His Essence, we know not yet. And that thou mayst
understand that not concerning the dispensations did he speak the
words, “now I know in part,” hear what follows. He adds then,
“but then shall I know, even as also I have been known.” He
was surely known not by the dispensations, but by God.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxv-p25">Let none therefore consider this to be a small or
simple transgression, but twofold, and threefold, yea and
manifold. For not only is there this impiety that they boast of
knowing those things which belong to the Spirit alone; and to the
only-begotten Son of God, but also that when Paul could not acquire
even this knowledge “which is in part” without the revelation
from above, these men say that they have obtained the whole from
their own reasonings. For neither are they able to point out that
the Scripture hath any where discoursed to us of these things.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxv-p26">[5.] But however, leaving their madness, let us
give heed to the words which follow concerning love. For he was
not content with these things, but adds again, saying,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxv-p27"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 13.13" id="iv.xxxv-p27.1" parsed="|1Cor|13|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.13.13">Ver. 13</scripRef>. “And now abideth, faith,
hope, love, these three; and the greatest of these is love.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxv-p28">For faith indeed and hope, when the good things
believed and hoped for are come, cease. And to show this Paul
said, “For hope that is seen is not hope; for who hopeth for that
which he seeth.” Again, “Now faith is the assurance of things
hoped for, the proving of things not seen.” (<scripRef passage="Rom. viii. 24; Heb. xi. 1" id="iv.xxxv-p28.1" parsed="|Rom|8|24|0|0;|Heb|11|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.8.24 Bible:Heb.11.1">Rom. viii. 24; Heb. xi. 1</scripRef>.) So that these cease when
those appear; but love is then most elevated, and becomes more
vehement. Another encomium of love. For neither is he content
with those before mentioned, but he strives to discover yet
another. And observe: he hath said that it is a great gift, and
a still more excellent way to these. He hath said, that without
it there is no great profit in our gifts; he hath shadowed out its
image at length; he intends again and in another manner to exalt
<pb n="204" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_204.html" id="iv.xxxv-Page_204" />it, and to show that it is
great from its abiding. Wherefore also he said, “But now
abideth faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these
is love.” How then is love the greater? In that those pass
away.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxv-p29">If now so great is the virtue of love, with
good reason doth he add and say, “Follow after love.” For
there is surely need of “following,” and a kind of vehement
running after her: in such sort doth she fly from us, and so many
are the things which trip us up in that direction. Wherefore we
have ever need of great earnestness in order to overtake her. And
to point out this, Paul said not, “follow love,” but,
“pursue<note place="end" n="220" id="iv.xxxv-p29.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxv-p30"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxxv-p30.1">ὃ</span><span class="Greek" id="iv.xxxv-p30.2">ιώκετε</span>.</p></note>” her;
stirring us up, and inflaming us to lay hold on her.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxv-p31">For so God from the beginning contrived ten thousand
ways for implanting her in us. Thus, first, He granted one head
to all, Adam. For why do we not all spring out of the earth? 
Why not full grown, as he was? In order that both the birth and
the bringings up of children, and the being born of another, might
bind us mutually together. For this cause neither made He woman
out of the earth: and because the thing of the same substance was
not equally sufficient to shame us into unanimity, unless we had
also the same progenitor, He provided also for this: since, if
now, being only separated by place, we consider ourselves alien
from one another; much more would this have happened if our race
had had two originals. For this cause therefore, as it were from
some one head, he bound together the whole body of the human
race. And because from the beginning they seemed to be in a
manner two, see how he fastens them together again, and gathers
them into one by marriage. For, “therefore,” saith He,
“shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave
unto his wife; and they shall be for one flesh.” (<scripRef passage="Gen. ii. 24" id="iv.xxxv-p31.1" parsed="|Gen|2|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.2.24">Gen. ii. 24</scripRef><note place="end" n="221" id="iv.xxxv-p31.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxv-p32"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxxv-p32.1">εἰς σάρκα μίαν</span>.</p></note>.) And he said not, “the
woman,” but, “the man,” because the desire too is stronger in
him. Yea, and for this cause He made it also stronger, that it
might bow the superior party to the absolute sway of this passion,
and might subjugate it to the weaker. And since marriage also
must needs be introduced, him from whom she sprang He made husband
to the woman. For all things in the eye of God are second to
love. And if when things had thus begun, the first man
straightway became so frantic, and the devil sowed among them so
great warfare and envy; what would he not have done, had they not
sprung from one root?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxv-p33">Further, in order that the one might be subject, and
the other rule; (for equality is wont oftentimes to bring in
strife;) he suffered it not to be a democracy, but a monarchy; and
as in an army, this order one may see in every family. In the
rank of monarch, for instance, there is the husband; but in the
rank of lieutenant and general, the wife; and the children too are
allotted a third station in command. Then after these a fourth
order, that of the servant. For these also bear rule over their
inferiors, and some one of them is oftentimes set over the whole,
keeping ever the post of the master, but still as a servant. And
together with this again another command, and among the children
themselves again another, according to their age and sex; since
among the children the female doth not possess equal sway. And
every where hath God made governments at small distances and thick
together, that all might abide in concord and much good order.
Therefore even before the race was increased to a multitude, when
the first two only were in being, He bade him govern, and her
obey. And in order again that He might not despise her as
inferior, and separate from her, see how He honored her, and made
them one, even before her creation. For, “Let us make for
man,” saith He, “a help meet,” implying that she was made for
his need, and thereby drawing him unto her who was made for his
sake: since to all those things are we more kindly disposed,
which are done for our sakes. But that she, on the other hand,
might not be elated, as being granted him for help, nor might burst
this bond, He makes her out of his side, signifying that she is a
part of the whole body. And that neither might the man be elated
therefore, He no longer permits that to belong to him alone which
before was his alone, but effected the contrary to this, by
bringing in procreation of children, and herein too giving the
chief honor unto the man, not however allowing the whole to be
his.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxv-p34">Seest thou how many bonds of love God hath
wrought? And these indeed by force of nature He hath lodged in us
as pledges of concord. For both our being of the same substance
leads to this; (for every animal loves its like;) and the woman
being produced from the man, and again the children from both.
Whence also many kinds of affection arise. For one we love as a
father, another as a grandfather; one as a mother, another as a
nurse; and one as a son or grandson or great-grandson again, and
another as a daughter, or grand-daughter; and one as a brother,
another as a nephew; and one as a sister, another as a niece. And
why need one recount all the names of consanguinity?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxv-p35">And He devised also another foundation of
affection. For having forbidden the marriage of kindred, he led
us out unto strangers and drew them again unto us. For since by
this natural kindred it was not possible that they <pb n="205" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_205.html" id="iv.xxxv-Page_205" />should be connected with us, he
connected us anew by marriage, uniting together whole families by
the single person of the bride, and mingling entire races with
races.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxv-p36">For, “marry not,” saith the Lord, (<scripRef passage="Lev. xviii. 6" id="iv.xxxv-p36.1" parsed="|Lev|18|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Lev.18.6">Lev. xviii. 6</scripRef>.) “thy sister, nor thy
father’s sister, nor any damsel which hath such consanguinity
with thee,” as utterly hinders the marriage;” naming the
degrees of such relationship. It is enough for thine affection
towards them that ye were the fruit of the same birth-pangs, and
that the others are in a different relation to thee. Why dost
thou narrow the breadth of love? Why dost thou idly throw away a
ground of affection towards her, such as that thou mightest thereby
provide thyself with distinct source for affection to spring from;
I mean, by taking a wife from another family, and through her a
chain of kinsmen, both mother, and father, and brethren, and their
connexions!</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxv-p37">[7.] Seest thou by how many ways He hath bound us
together? Nevertheless, not even this sufficed Him, but He
likewise made us to stand in need of one another, that thus also He
might bring us together, because necessities above all create
friendships. For no other reason neither suffered He all things
to be produced in every place, that hence also He might compel us
to mix with one another. But having set us in need of one
another, He on the other hand made the intercourse easy. Since if
this were not so, the matter would have turned out painful and
difficult in another way. For if one that wanted a physician, or
a carpenter, or any other workman, had need to set off on a long
foreign sojourn, the whole had come to nought. Here then is why
He founded cities also, and brought all into one place. And
accordingly that we might easily keep up intercourse with distant
countries, He spread the level of the sea between us, and gave us
the swiftness of winds, thereby making our voyages easy. And at
the beginning He even gathered all men together in one spot, and
did not disperse them until they who first received the gift abused
their concord unto sin. However, He hath drawn us together in
every way; both by nature, and by consanguinity, and by language,
and by place; and as he willed not that we should fall from
paradise; (for had He willed it, He would not have placed there at
all “the man whom He had formed,” but he that disobeyed was the
cause;) so neither was it His will that men should have divers
tongues; since otherwise He would have made it so from the
beginning. But now “the whole earth was of one language, and
all had one speech.” (<scripRef passage="Gen. xi. 1" id="iv.xxxv-p37.1" parsed="|Gen|11|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.11.1">Gen. xi. 1</scripRef>.)</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxv-p38">Here is the reason why, when it was needful that the
earth should be destroyed, not even then did He make us of other
matter, nor did He translate the righteous man, but leaving him in
the midst of the deluge, like a kind of spark of the world, He
rekindled our race from thence, even by the blessed Noah. And
from the beginning He made one sovereignty only, setting the man
over the woman. But after that our race ran headlong into extreme
disorder, He appointed other sovereignties also, those of Masters,
and those of Governors, and this too for love’s sake. That is,
since vice was a thing apt to dissolve and subvert our race, He set
those who administer justice in the midst of our cities as a kind
of physicians, that driving away vice, as it were a plague to love,
they might gather together all in one.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxv-p39">And that not only in cities, but also in each
family there might be great unanimity, He honored the man with rule
and superiority; the woman on the other hand He armed with
desire: and the gift also of procreation of children, He
committed in common to both, and withal He furnished also other
things apt to conciliate love: neither entrusting all to the man,
nor all to the woman; but “dividing these things also severally
to each;” to her entrusting the house, and to him the market; to
him the work of feeding, for he tills the ground; to her that of
clothing, for loom and distaff are the woman’s. For it is God
Himself who gave to woman-kind skill in woven work. Woe be to
covetousness, which suffers not this difference to appear!  For
the general effeminacy<note place="end" n="222" id="iv.xxxv-p39.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxv-p40"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxxv-p40.1">βλακεία</span>.</p></note> hath gone so far as to introduce
our men to the looms, and put shuttles into their hands, and the
woof, and threads. Nevertheless, even thus the forethought of the
divine economy shines out. For we still greatly need the woman in
other more necessary things, and we require the help of our
inferiors in those things which keep our life together.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxv-p41">[8.] And so strong is the compulsion of this need
that though one be richer than all men, not even thus is he rid of
this close conjunction, and of his want of that which is inferior
to himself. For it is not, we see, the poor only who need the
rich, but the rich also the poor; and these require those more than
the others them. And that thou mayest see it more clearly, let us
suppose, if it seem good, two cities, the one of rich only, but the
other of poor; and neither in that of the rich let there be any
poor man, nor in that of the poor any rich; but let us purge out
both thoroughly, and see which will be the more able to support
itself. For if we find that of the poor able, it is evident that
the rich will more stand in need of them.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxv-p42">Now then, in that city of the affluent there will be
no manufacturer, no builder, no carpenter, no shoe-maker, no baker,
no husband<pb n="206" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_206.html" id="iv.xxxv-Page_206" />man , no brazier, no
rope-maker, nor any other such trade. For who among the rich
would ever choose to follow these crafts, seeing that the very men
who take them in hand, when they become rich, endure no longer the
discomfort caused by these works? How then shall this our city
stand? “The rich,” it is replied, “giving money, will buy
these things of the poor.” Well then, they will not be
sufficient for themselves, their needing the others proves that.
But how will they build houses? Will they purchase this too? 
But the nature of things cannot admit this. Therefore they must
needs invite the artificers thither, and destroy the law, which we
made at first when we were founding the city. For you remember,
that we said, “let there be no poor man within it.” But, lo,
necessity, even against our will, hath invited and brought them
in. Whence it is evident that it is impossible without poor for a
city to subsist: since if the city were to continue refusing to
admit any of these, it will be no longer a city but will perish.
Plainly then it will not support itself, unless it shall collect
the poor as a kind of preservers, to be within itself.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxv-p43">But let us look also upon the city of the poor,
whether this too will be in a like needy condition, on being
deprived of the rich. And first let us in our discourse
thoroughly clear the nature of riches, and point them out
plainly. What then may riches be? Gold, and silver, and
precious stones, and garments silken, purple, and embroidered with
gold. Now then that we have seen what riches are, let us drive
them away from our city of the poor: and if we are to make it
purely a city of poor persons, let not any gold appear there, no
not in a dream, nor garments of such quality; and if you will,
neither silver, nor vessels of silver. What then? Because of
this will that city and its concerns live in want, tell me? Not
at all. For suppose first there should be need to build; one does
not want gold and silver and pearls, but skill, and hands, and
hands not of any kind, but such as are become callous, and fingers
hardened, and great strength, and wood, and stones: suppose again
one would weave a garment, neither here have we need of gold and
silver, but, as before, of hands and skill, and women to work.
And what if one require husbandry, and digging the ground?  Is it
rich men who are wanted, or poor? It is evident to every one,
poor. And when iron too is to be wrought, or any such thing to be
done, this is the race of men whereof we most stand in need. What
respect then remains wherein we may stand in need of the rich?
except the thing required be, to pull down this city. For should
that sort of people make an entrance, and these philosophers, for
(for I call them philosophers, who seek after nothing superfluous,)
should fall to desiring gold and jewels, giving themselves up to
idleness and luxury; they will ruin everything from that day
forward.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxv-p44">[9.] “But unless wealth be useful,” saith one,
“wherefore hath it been given by God?” And whence is it
evident, that being rich is from God? “The Scripture saith,
‘The silver is Mine, and the gold is Mine,’ and to whomsoever I
will, I will give it.” (<scripRef passage="Hag. ii. 8" id="iv.xxxv-p44.1" parsed="|Hag|2|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Hag.2.8">Hag. ii. 8</scripRef>.) Here, if I were not
doing an unseemly thing, I could at this moment laugh loudly, in
derision of those who say these things: because as little
children admitted to a King’s table, together with that food they
thrust into their mouth everything that comes to hand; so also do
these together with the divine Scriptures privily bring in their
own notions. For this, “the silver is Mine, and the gold is
Mine,” I know to have been spoken by the Prophet; but that, “to
whomsoever I will, I will give it,” is not added, but is brought
in by these offscourings<note place="end" n="223" id="iv.xxxv-p44.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxv-p45"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxxv-p45.1">συρφετῶν</span>.</p></note> of the people. And as to the
former, why it was said, I will explain. The Prophet Haggai,
because he was continually promising to the Jews after their return
from Babylon, that he would show the temple in its former
appearance, and some doubted of the thing spoken, and considered it
to be well nigh impossible that after being reduced to dust and
ashes, the house should appear again such as it was;—he, to
remove their unbelief, in the person of God saith these things; as
if he said, “Why are ye afraid? and why do ye refuse to
believe? ‘The silver is Mine, and the gold is Mine,’ and I
need not to borrow from others, and so to beautify the house.”
And to show that this is the meaning he adds, “and the glory of
this house, the latter glory shall be greater than the glory of the
former.” Let us not then bring in spiders’ webs upon the
royal robe. For if any person, detected in weaving a counterfeit
thread in a purple vest, is to suffer the severest punishment, much
more in spiritual things; since neither is it an ordinary sin,
which is hereby committed. And why say I, by adding and taking
away? By a mere point, and by a mere circumstance of delivery in
the reading, many impious thoughts have not seldom been brought
into being.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxv-p46">“Whence then the rich,” saith one? “for it
hath been said, ‘Riches and poverty are from the Lord.’”
Let us then ask those who object these things against us, whether
all riches and all poverty are from the Lord? Nay, who would say
this? For we see that both by rapine, 
<pb n="207" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_207.html" id="iv.xxxv-Page_207" />and by wickedly breaking open of tombs, and by
witchcraft, and by other such devices, great wealth is gathered by
many, and the possessors are not worthy even to live. What then,
tell me, do we say that this wealth is from God? Far from it.
Whence then? From sin. For so the harlot by doing indignity to
her own body grows rich, and a handsome youth oftentimes selling
his bloom with disgrace brings himself gold, and the tomb-spoiler
by breaking open men’s sepulchres gathers together unjust wealth,
and the robber by digging through walls. All wealth therefore is
not from God. “What then,” saith one, “shall we say to this
expression?” Acquaint thyself first with a kind of poverty
which proceeds not from God, and then we will proceed to the saying
itself. I mean, that when any dissolute youth spends his wealth
either on harlots, or on conjurors, or on any other such evil
desires, and becomes poor, is it not very evident that this hath
not come from God, but from his own profligacy? Again, if any
through idleness become poor, if any through folly be brought down
to beggary, if any, by taking in hand perilous and unlawful
practices; is it not quite evident, that neither hath any one of
these and other such persons been brought down to this their
poverty by God?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxv-p47">“Doth then the Scripture speak falsely?” God
forbid! but they do foolishly, who neglect to examine with due
exactness all things written. For if this on the one hand be
acknowledged, that the Scriptures cannot lie; and this on the other
hand proved, that not all wealth is from God; the weakness of
inconsiderate readers is the cause of the difficulty.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxv-p48">[10.] Now it were right for us to dismiss you,
having herein exculpated the Scripture, that ye may suffer this
punishment at our hands for your negligence concerning the
Scriptures: but because I greatly spare you and cannot any longer
bear to look on you confused and disturbed, let us also add the
solution, having first mentioned the speaker, and when it was
spoken, and to whom. For not alike to all doth God speak, as
neither do we deal alike with children and men. When then was it
spoken, and by whom, and to whom? By Solomon in the Old Testament
to the Jews, who knew no other than things of sense, and by these
proved the power of God. For these are they who say, “Can He
give bread also?” and, “What sign showest Thou unto us? Our
fathers did eat manna in the desert:—whose God is their
belly.” (<scripRef passage="Ps. lxxviii. 24; Matt. xii. 38; John vi. 31; Philip. iii. 19" id="iv.xxxv-p48.1" parsed="|Ps|78|24|0|0;|Matt|12|38|0|0;|John|6|31|0|0;|Phil|3|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.78.24 Bible:Matt.12.38 Bible:John.6.31 Bible:Phil.3.19">Ps. lxxviii.
24; Matt. xii. 38; John vi. 31; Philip. iii. 19</scripRef>.) Since then they were
proving Him by these things, He saith to them, “This is also
possible with God to make both rich and poor;” not that it is of
course He Himself who maketh them, but that He can, when He will.
Just as when he saith, “Who rebuketh the sea, and maketh it dry,
and drieth up all the rivers,” (<scripRef passage="Nahum i. 4" id="iv.xxxv-p48.2" parsed="|Nah|1|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Nah.1.4">Nahum i. 4</scripRef>.) and yet this was never
done. How then doth the prophet say so? Not as though it were a
doing always, but as a thing that was possible for Him to do.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxv-p49">What kind of poverty then doth He give, and what
kind of wealth? Remember the patriarch, and thou shalt know the
kind of wealth that is given by God. For He made both Abraham
rich, and after him Job, even as Job himself saith; “If we have
received good from the Lord, shall we not also receive evil?”
(<scripRef passage="Job ii. 10" id="iv.xxxv-p49.1" parsed="|Job|2|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Job.2.10">Job ii. 10</scripRef>.) And the wealth of Jacob
thence had its beginning. There is also a poverty which cometh
from Him, that which is commended, such as He once would have
introduced to the knowledge of that rich man, saying, “If thou
wouldest be perfect, sell thy goods, and give to the poor, and
come, follow Me.” (<scripRef passage="Matt. xix. 21" id="iv.xxxv-p49.2" parsed="|Matt|19|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.19.21">Matt. xix. 21</scripRef>.) And to the disciples
again, making a law and saying, “Provide neither gold, nor
silver, nor two coats.” (<scripRef passage="Matt. ix. 10" id="iv.xxxv-p49.3" parsed="|Matt|9|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.9.10">Matt. ix. 10</scripRef>.) Say not then that all
wealth is His gift: seeing that cases have been pointed out of
its being collected both by murderers, and by rapine, and by ten
thousand other devices.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxv-p50">But again the discourse reverts to our former
question: viz. “if the rich are no way useful to us, wherefore
are they made rich?” What then must we say? That these are
not useful who so make themselves rich; whereas those surely who
are made so by God are in the highest degree useful. And do thou
learn this from the very things done by those whom we just now
mentioned. Thus Abraham possessed wealth for all strangers, and
for all in need. For he who on the approach of three men, as he
supposed, sacrificed a calf and kneaded three measures of fine
flour, and that while sitting in his door in the heat of the day;
consider with what liberality and readiness he used to spend his
substance on all, together with his goods giving also the service
of his body, and this at such an advanced age; being a harbor to
strangers, to all who had come to any kind of want, and possessing
nothing as his own, not even his son: since at God’s command he
actually delivered up even him; and along with his son he gave up
also himself and all his house, when he hastened to snatch his
brother’s son out of danger; and this he did not for lucre’s
sake, but of mere humanity. When, for instance, they who were
saved by him would put the spoils at his disposal, he rejected all,
even to “a thread and a shoe-latchet.” (<scripRef passage="Gen. xiv. 23" id="iv.xxxv-p50.1" parsed="|Gen|14|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.14.23">Gen. xiv. 23</scripRef>.)</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxv-p51">Such also was the blessed Job. “For my door,”
saith, “was open to every one who came: (<scripRef passage="Job xx. 15" id="iv.xxxv-p51.1" parsed="|Job|20|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Job.20.15">Job xx. 15</scripRef>.) “I was eyes to the
blind, and feet to the lame: I was a father of the helpless, the
stranger lodged not without, 
<pb n="208" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_208.html" id="iv.xxxv-Page_208" />and the helpless, whatever need they had, failed
not of it, neither suffered I one helpless man to go out of my door
with a empty bosom.” And much more too than these, that we may
not now recount all, he continued to do, spending all his wealth on
the needy.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxv-p52">Wilt thou also look upon those who have become rich
but not of God, that thou mayest learn how they employed their
wealth? Behold him in the parable of Lazarus, how he imparted not
so much as a share of his crumbs. Behold Ahab, how not even the
vineyard is free from his extortion: behold Gehazi: behold all
such. Thus they on the one hand who make just acquisitions, as
having received from God, spend on the commands of God: but they
who in act of acquiring offend God, in the expending also do the
same: consuming it on harlots and parasites, or burying and
shutting it up, but laying out nothing upon the poor.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxv-p53">“And wherefore,” saith one, “doth God suffer
such men to be rich?” Because He is long-suffering: because
He would bring us to repentance; because He hath prepared hell;
because “He hath appointed a day in which He is to judge the
world.” (<scripRef passage="Acts xvii. 31" id="iv.xxxv-p53.1" parsed="|Acts|17|31|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.17.31">Acts xvii.
31</scripRef>.) Whereas did
He use at once to punish them that are rich and not virtuously,
Zacchæus would not have had an appointed time<note place="end" n="224" id="iv.xxxv-p53.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxv-p54"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxxv-p54.1">προθεσμίαν</span>.</p></note> for repentance, so as even to
restore fourfold whatever he had unjustly taken, and to add half of
his goods; nor Matthew, to be converted and become an Apostle,
taken off as he would have been before the due season; nor yet many
other such. Therefore doth He bear with them, calling all to
repentance. But if they will not, but continue in the same, they
shall hear Paul saying that “after their hardness and impenitent
heart they treasure up unto themselves wrath against the day of
wrath, and revelation, and righteous judgment of God: 
(<scripRef passage="Rom. ii. 5" id="iv.xxxv-p54.2" parsed="|Rom|2|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.2.5">Rom. ii. 5</scripRef>.) which wrath that we may
escape, let us become rich with the riches of heaven, and follow
after the laudable sort of poverty. For thus shall we obtain also
the good things to come: the which may we all obtain through the
grace and mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ, with Whom to the Father,
with the Holy Ghost, be glory, power, and honor, now and for ever,
and world without end. Amen.</p>

had with exactness rehearsed unto them all the excellence of love,
he exhorts them in what follows, with alacrity to lay hold of it.
Wherefore also he said, “Follow after:” for he that is in

that is in chase, when by himself he cannot, by those that are

apprehended, no more let her go, that she may not again escape
us. For continually she springs away from us, because we use her
not as we ought, but prefer all things unto her. Therefore we
ought to make every effort, so as perfectly to retain her. For if

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvi-p6">Then that they might not suppose that for no other

“For he that speaketh in a tongue, speaketh not unto men, but

“But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men edification, and
exhortation, and comfort.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvi-p10">At this point he makes a comparison between the
gifts, and lowers that of the tongues, showing it to be neither
altogether useless, nor very profitable by itself. For in fact
they were greatly puffed up on account of this, because the gift
was considered to be a great one. And 
<pb n="209" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_209.html" id="iv.xxxvi-Page_209" />it was thought great because the Apostles
received it first, and with so great display; it was not however
therefore to be esteemed above all the others. Wherefore then did
the Apostles receive it before the rest? Because they were to go
abroad every where. And as in the time of building the tower the
one tongue was divided into many; so then the many tongues
frequently met in one man, and the same person used to discourse
both in the Persian, and the Roman, and the Indian, and many other
tongues, the Spirit sounding within him: and the gift was called
the gift of tongues because he could all at once speak divers
languages. See accordingly how he both depresses and elevates
it. Thus, by saying, “He that speaketh with tongues, speaketh
not unto men, but unto God, for no man understandeth,” he
depressed it, implying that the profit of it was not great; but by
adding, “but in the Spirit he speaketh mysteries” he again
elevated it, that it might not seem to be superfluous and useless
and given in vain.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvi-p11">“But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men
edification, and exhortation, and comfort.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvi-p12">Seest thou by what he signifies the choice nature of
this gift? i.e., by the common benefit? and how every where he
gives the higher honor to that which tends to the profit of the
many? For do not the former speak unto men also? tell me. But
not so much “edification, and exhortation, and comfort.” So
that the being powered by the Spirit is common to both, as well to
him that prophesieth, as to him that speaketh with tongues; but in
this, the one (he, I mean, who prophesieth) hath the advantage in
that he is also profitable unto the hearers. For they who with
tongues were not understood by them that had not the gift.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvi-p13">What then? Did they edify no man? “Yes,”
saith he, “themselves alone:” wherefore also he adds,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvi-p14"><scripRef passage="1 Cor 14.4" id="iv.xxxvi-p14.1" parsed="|1Cor|14|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.14.4">Ver. 4</scripRef>.
“He that speaketh in tongue edifieth himself.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvi-p15">And how, if he know not what he saith? Why, for
the present, he is speaking of them who understand what they
say;—understand it themselves, but know not how to render it unto
others.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvi-p16">“But he that prophesieth edifieth the Church.”
Now as great as is the difference between a single person and the
Church, so great is the interval between these two. Seest thou
his wisdom, how he doth not thrust out the gift and make nothing of
it, but signifies it to have some advantage, small though it be,
and such as to suffice the possessor only?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvi-p17">[2.] Next, lest they should suppose that in envy
to them he depresses the tongues, (for the more part had this
gift,) to correct their suspicion he saith,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvi-p18"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 14.5" id="iv.xxxvi-p18.1" parsed="|1Cor|14|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.14.5">Ver. 5</scripRef>.
“I would have you all speak with tongues, but rather that ye
should prophesy: for greater is he that prophesieth than he that
speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the Church may
receive edifying.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvi-p19">But “rather” and “greater,” do not mark
opposition, but superiority. So that hence also it is evident
that he is not disparaging the gift, but leading them to better
things, displaying both his carefulness on their behalf, and a
spirit free from all envy. For neither did he say, “I would
that two or three,” but, “that ye all spake with tongues” and
not this only, but also, “that ye prophesied;” and this rather
than that; “for greater is he that prophesieth.” For since he
hath established and proved it, he next proceeds also to assert it;
not however simply, but with a qualification. Accordingly he
adds, “except he interpret;” since if he be able to do this, I
mean the interpreting, “he hath become equal unto the prophet,”
so he speaks, “because then there are many who reap the advantage
of it;” a thing to be especially observed, how this throughout,
before all else, is his object,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvi-p20"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 14.6" id="iv.xxxvi-p20.1" parsed="|1Cor|14|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.14.6">Ver. 6</scripRef>.
“But now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues,
what shall I profit you, unless I speak to you either by way of
revelation, or of knowledge, or of prophesying, or of
teaching?”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvi-p21">“And why speak I,” saith he, “of the rest? 
Nay, let the person who speaketh with tongues be Paul: for not
even so will any good come to the hearers.” And these things he
saith to signify that he is seeking their profit, not bearing any
grudge against them that have the gift; since not even in his own
person doth he shrink from pointing out its unprofitableness. And
indeed it is his constant way to work out the disagreeable topics
in his own person: as in the beginning of the Epistle he said,
“Who then is Paul? and who is Apollos? and who is Cephas?”
This same then he doth also here, saying, “Not even I shall
profit you, except I speak to you either by way of revelation, or
of prophesying, or of knowledge, or of teaching.” And what he
means is, “if I say not somewhat that can be made intelligible to
you and that may be clear, but merely make display of my having the
gift of tongues;—tongues which ye do not understand, ye will go
away with no sort of profit. For how should you profit by a voice
which ye understand not?”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvi-p22">[3] <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 14.7" id="iv.xxxvi-p22.1" parsed="|1Cor|14|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.14.7">Ver. 7</scripRef>.
“Even things without life, giving a voice, whether pipe or harp,
if they give not a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known
what is piped?”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvi-p23">“And why do I say,” saith he, “that in our
<pb n="210" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_210.html" id="iv.xxxvi-Page_210" />case this is unprofitable, and
that only useful which is clear and easy to be apprehended by the
hearers? Since even in musical instruments without life one may
see this: for whether it be pipe or harp, yet if it be struck or
blown confusedly and unskilfully, without proper cadence or
harmony, it will captivate none of the hearers. For even in these
inarticulate sounds there is need of some distinctness: and if
thou strike not or breathe into the pipe according to art, thou
hast done nothing. Now if from things without life we require so
much distinctness, and harmony, and appropriateness, and into those
inarticulate sounds we strive and contend to infuse so much
meaning, much more in men indued with life and reason, and in
spiritual gifts, ought one to make significancy an object.</p>

“For if the trumpet give an uncertain voice, who shall prepare
himself for war?”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvi-p25">Thus from things merely ornamental he carries on his
argument to those which are more necessary and useful; and saith
that not in the harp alone, but in the trumpet also one may see
this effect produced. For in that also there are certain
measures; and they give out at one time a warlike note, and at
another one that is not so; and again sometimes it leads out to
line of battle and at others recalls from it: and unless one know
this, there is great danger. Which is just what he means, and the
mischief of it what he is manifesting, when he saith, “who shall
prepare himself for war?” So then, if it have not this quality,
it is the ruin of all. “And what is this to us,” saith one? 
Truly it concerns you very especially; wherefore also he adds,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvi-p26"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 14.9" id="iv.xxxvi-p26.1" parsed="|1Cor|14|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.14.9">Ver. 9</scripRef>.
“So also ye, unless ye utter by the tongue, speech easy to be
understood, ye will be speaking into the air:” i.e., calling to
nobody, speaking unto no one. Thus every where he shows its
unprofitableness.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvi-p27">[4.] “But if it be unprofitable, why was it
given?” saith one. So as to be useful to him that hath received
it. But if it is to be so to others also, there must be added
interpretation. Now this he saith, bringing them near to one
another; that if a person himself have not the gift of
interpretation, he may take unto him another that hath it, and make
his own gift useful through him. Wherefore he every where points
out its imperfection, that so he may bind them together. Any how,
he that accounts it to be sufficient for itself, doth not so much
commend it as disparage it, not suffering it to shine brightly by
the interpretation. For excellent indeed and necessary is the
gift, but it is so when it hath one to explain what is spoken.
Since the finger too is a necessary thing, but when you separate it
from the other members, it will not be equally useful: and the
trumpet is necessary, but when it sounds at random, it is rather an
annoyance. Yea, neither shall any art come to light, without
matter subject to it; nor is matter put into shape, if no form be
assigned to it. Suppose then the voice to be as the
subject-matter, but the distinctness as that form, which not being
present, there will be no use in the material.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvi-p28"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 14.10" id="iv.xxxvi-p28.1" parsed="|1Cor|14|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.14.10">Ver. 10</scripRef>. “There are, it may be, so
many kinds of voices in the world, and no kind is without
signification:” i.e., so many tongues, so many voices of
Scythians, Thracians, Romans, Persians, Moors, Indians, Egyptians,
innumerable other nations.</p>

meaning of the voice, I shall be to him that speaketh a
barbarian.” “For suppose not,” saith he, “that this
happens only in our case; rather in all one may see this taking
place: so that I do not say this to disparage the voice, but to
signify that to me it is useless, as long as it is not
intelligible.” Next, that he may not render the accusation
unpalatable, he makes his charge alike for the two, saying, “He
shall be unto me a barbarian, and I to him.” Not from the
nature of the voice, but from our ignorance. Seest thou how by
little and little he draws men to that which is akin to the
subject. Which is his use to do, to fetch his examples from afar,
and to end with what more properly belongs to the matter. For
having spoken of a pipe and harp, wherein is much that is inferior
and unprofitable, he comes to the trumpet, a thing more useful;
next, from that he proceeds to the very voice itself. So also
before, when he was discoursing to show that it was not forbidden
the Apostles to receive, beginning first with husbandmen, and
shepherds, and soldiers, then he brought the discourse on to that
which is nearer to the subject, the priests in the old
covenant.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvi-p30">But do thou, I pray, consider, how every where
he hath given diligence to free the gift from censure, and to bring
round the charge to the receivers of it. For he said not, “I
shall be a barbarian,” but, “unto him that speaketh, a
barbarian.” And again, he did not say, “he that speaketh
shall be a barbarian,” but “he that speaketh shall be a
barbarian unto me<note place="end" n="226" id="iv.xxxvi-p30.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxvi-p31"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxxvi-p31.1">ὁ ἐμοι

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvi-p32">[5.] “What then must be done?” saith he.
Why, so far from disparaging, one ought to recommend and to teach
it; as indeed himself also doth. Since after he had accused and
rebuked it and shown its unprofitableness, he proceeds to counsel
them; saying,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvi-p33"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 14.12" id="iv.xxxvi-p33.1" parsed="|1Cor|14|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.14.12">Ver. 12</scripRef>. “So also ye, since as ye
are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that ye may abound unto the

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvi-p34"><pb n="211" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_211.html" id="iv.xxxvi-Page_211" />Seest thou his
aim every where, how he looks to one thing continually and in all
cases, the general utility, the profiting the Church; laying this
down as a kind of rule? And he did not say, “that ye may obtain
the gifts” but, “that ye may abound,” i.e., that ye may even
possess them in great plenitude. Thus, so far am I from wishing
you not to possess them, that I even wish you to abound in them,
only so that ye handle them with a view to the common advantage.
And how is this to be done? This he adds, saying,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvi-p35"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 14.13" id="iv.xxxvi-p35.1" parsed="|1Cor|14|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.14.13">Ver. 13</scripRef>. “Wherefore let him that

will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding
also; I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the
understanding also.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvi-p38">Here he shows that it is in their power to
obtain the gift. For, “let him pray,” saith he, i.e., “let
him contribute his own part,” since if thou ask diligently, thou
wilt surely receive. Ask accordingly not to have the gift of
tongue only, but also of interpretation, that thou mayest become
useful unto all, and not shut up thy gift in thyself alone.
“For if I pray in a tongue,” saith he, “my spirit prayeth,
but my understanding is unfruitful.” Seest thou how by degrees
bringing his argument to a point, he signifies that not to others
only is such an one useless, but also to himself; if at least
“his understanding is unfruitful?” For if a man should speak
only in the Persian, or any other foreign tongue, and not
understand what he saith, then of course to himself also will he be
thenceforth a barbarian, not to another only, from not knowing the
meaning of the sound. For there were of old many who had also a
gift of prayer, together with a tongue; and they prayed, and the
tongue spake, praying either in the Persian or Latin language<note place="end" n="227" id="iv.xxxvi-p38.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxvi-p39"> [From this phrase—a similar one occurs in the
next homily—it seems that Chrysostom held the tongue to mean the
power of speaking in a language not before acquired. Most modern
expositors understand by it an ecstatic utterance, a view which
Tertullian alone of the patristic writers held.—C.]</p></note>, but their
understanding knew not what was spoken. Wherefore also he said,
“If I pray in a tongue, my spirit prayeth,” i.e., the gift
which is given me and which moves my tongue, “but my
understanding is unfruitful.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvi-p40">What then may that be which is best in itself,
and doth good? And how ought one to act, or what request of
God? To pray, “both with the spirit,” i.e., the gift, and
“with the understanding.”<note place="end" n="228" id="iv.xxxvi-p40.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxvi-p41"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxxvi-p41.1">διανοίᾳ</span>.</p></note>  Wherefore also he said, “I will
pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding
also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the
understanding also.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvi-p42">[6.] He signifieth the same thing here also, that
both the tongue may speak, and the understanding may not be
ignorant of the things spoken. For except this be so, there will
also be another confusion.</p>

is unable to say the Amen. And what he saith is this: “if
thou shalt bless in a barbarian tongue, not knowing what thou
sayest, nor able to interpret, the layman cannot respond the
Amen. For not hearing the words, ‘forever and ever,’ which
are at the end<note place="end" n="231" id="iv.xxxvi-p47.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxvi-p48"> i.e., at the end of the Long Thanksgiving in that

say the Amen.” Then again, comforting him concerning this, that
he might not seem to hold the gift too cheap; the same kind of
remark as he made above, that “he speaketh mysteries,” and
“speaketh unto God,” and “edifieth himself,” and “prayeth
with the spirit,” intending no little comfort from these things,
this also he utters here, saying, “for thou indeed givest thanks
well,” since thou speakest being moved by the Spirit: but the
other hearing nothing nor knowing what is said, stands there,
receiving no great advantage by it.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvi-p49">[7.] Further, because he had run down the
possessors of this gift, as though they had no such great thing;
that he might not seem to hold them cheap, as being himself
destitute of it, see what he saith:</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvi-p50"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 14.18" id="iv.xxxvi-p50.1" parsed="|1Cor|14|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.14.18">Ver. 18</scripRef>. “I thank God,

more than ye all.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvi-p52">And this he doth also in another place intending,
namely, to take away the advantages of Judaism and to show that
henceforth they are nothing, he begins by declaring that himself
had been endowed with them, yea, and that in very great excess; and
then he calls them “loss,” thus saying, “If any man thinketh
to have confidence in the flesh, I more: circumcised the eighth
day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of
Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee; as touching zeal,
persecuting the Church; as touching the righteousness which is the
law, found blameless.” (<scripRef passage="Philip. iii. 4-7" id="iv.xxxvi-p52.1" parsed="|Phil|3|4|3|7" osisRef="Bible:Phil.3.4-Phil.3.7">Philip. iii. 4–7</scripRef>.) And then, having <pb n="212" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_212.html" id="iv.xxxvi-Page_212" />signified himself to have the
advantage of all, he saith, “Howbeit what things were gain to me,
those have I counted loss for Christ.” So also he doth here,
saying, “I speak with tongues more than ye all.” Do not ye
therefore glory as though ye only had the gift. For I also
possess it, yea more than ye.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvi-p53"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 14.19" id="iv.xxxvi-p53.1" parsed="|1Cor|14|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.14.19">Ver. 19</scripRef>. “Howbeit in the Church I
had rather speak five words with my understanding, that I might
instruct others also.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvi-p54">What is that, “speak with my understanding, that I
might instruct others also?” “Understanding what I say,”
and “words which I can both interpret to others, and speak
intelligently, and teach the hearers.” “Than ten thousand
words in a tongue.” Wherefore? “That I may instruct
others,” saith he. For the one hath but display only; the
other, great utility: this being what he everywhere seeks, I mean
the common profit. And yet the gift of tongues was strange, but
that of prophecy familiar and ancient and heretofore given to many;
this on the contrary then first given: howbeit it was not much
cared for by him. Wherefore neither did he employ it; not because
he had it not, but because he always sought the more profitable
things: being as he was free from all vain-glory, and considering
one thing only, how he might render the hearers better.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvi-p55">[8.] And here is the reason of the faculty he had
of looking to the expedient both to himself and to others: viz.
because he was free from vain-glory. Since he assuredly that is
enslaved by it, so far from discerning what is good to others, will
not even know his own.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvi-p56">Such was Simon, who, because he looked to
vain-glory, did not even see his own advantage. Such also were
the Jews, who because of this sacrificed<note place="end" n="233" id="iv.xxxvi-p56.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxvi-p57"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxxvi-p57.1">προέπιον</span>.</p></note> their own salvation to the devil.
Hence also did idols spring, and by this madness did the heathen
philosophers excite themselves, and make shipwreck in their false
doctrines. And observe the perverseness of this passion: how
because of it some of them also made themselves poor, others were
eager for wealth. So potent is its tyranny that it prevails even
in direct contraries. Thus one man is vain of chastity, and
contrariwise another of adultery; and this man of justice, and
another of injustice; so of luxury and fasting, modesty and
rashness, riches and poverty. I say poverty: since some of them
that were with out, when it was in their power to receive, for
admiration’s sake forbore to receive. But not so the
Apostles: that they were pure from vainglory, they showed by
their doings: in that, when some were calling them Gods and were
ready to sacrifice-unto them oxen with garlands, they did not
merely just forbid what was doing, but they even rent their
clothes. (<scripRef passage="Acts xiv. 13, 14" id="iv.xxxvi-p57.2" parsed="|Acts|14|13|14|14" osisRef="Bible:Acts.14.13-Acts.14.14">Acts
xiv. 13, 14</scripRef>.) And
after they had set the lame man upright, when all with open mouths
were gazing at them, they said, “Why look ye so earnestly on us,
as though by our own power we had made this man to walk<note place="end" n="234" id="iv.xxxvi-p57.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxvi-p58"> <scripRef passage="Acts iii. 14" id="iv.xxxvi-p58.1" parsed="|Acts|3|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.3.14">Acts iii.

those, among men who admired poverty, chose to themselves a state
of poverty: but these among persons who despised poverty and gave
praise to wealth. And these, if they received aught, ministered
to the needy. Thus, not vain-glory but benevolence, was the
motive of all they did. But those quite the reverse; as enemies
and pests of our common nature, and no otherwise, did they such
things. Thus one sunk all his goods in<note place="end" n="235" id="iv.xxxvi-p58.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxvi-p59"> Aristippus. See Hor. <i>Sat.</i> ii. 3.
100; Cic. <i>de Invent</i>. ii. 58.</p></note> the sea for no good purpose,
imitating fools and madmen: and another let all his land go to
sheep common.<note place="end" n="236" id="iv.xxxvi-p59.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxvi-p60"> Democritus. See Hor. <i>Ep</i>. i.
12.</p></note>  Thus they
did every thing for vain-glory. But not so the Apostles; rather
they both received what was given them, and distributed to the
needy with so great liberality that they even lived in continual
hunger. But if they had been enamored of glory, they would not
have practiced this, the receiving and distributing, for fear of
some suspicion arising against them. For he who throws away his
own for glory, will much more refuse to receive the things of
others, that he may not be accounted to stand in need of others nor
incur any suspicion. But these thou seest both ministering to the
poor, and themselves begging for them. So truly were they more
loving than any fathers.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvi-p61">[9.] And observe also their laws, how moderate and
freed from all vain-glory. Thus: “Having” saith he,” food
and covering, let us therewith be content.” (<scripRef passage="1 Tim. vi. 8" id="iv.xxxvi-p61.1" parsed="|1Tim|6|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.6.8">1 Tim. vi. 8</scripRef>.) Not like him of
Sinope<note place="end" n="237" id="iv.xxxvi-p61.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxvi-p62"> Diogenes the Cynic.</p></note>, who clothed
in rags and living in a cask to no good end, astonished many, but
profited none: whereas Paul did none of these things; (for
neither had he an eye to ostentation;) but was both clothed in
ordinary apparel with all decency, and lived in a house
continually, and displayed all exactness in the practice of all
other virtue; which the cynic despised, living impurely and
publicly disgracing himself, and dragged away by his mad passion
for glory. For if any one ask the reason of his living in a cask,
he will find no other but vain-glory alone. But Paul also paid
rent for the house wherein he abode at Rome. Although he who was
able to do things far severer, could much more have had strength
for this. But he looked not to glory, that savage monster, that
fearful demon, that pest of the world, that <pb n="213" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_213.html" id="iv.xxxvi-Page_213" />poisonous viper. Since, as that
animal tears through the womb of her parent with her teeth, so also
this passion tears in pieces him that begets it.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvi-p63">[10.] By what means then may one find a remedy for
this manifold distemper? By bringing forward those that have
trodden it under foot, and with an eye to their image so ordering
one’s own life. For so the patriarch Abraham.—nay, let none
accuse me of tautology if I often make mention of him, and on all
occasions: this being that which most of all shows him wonderful,
and deprives them that refuse to imitate him of all excuse. For,
if we exhibit one doing well in this particular, and another in
that, some one might say that virtue is hardly to be attained; for
that it is scarcely possible to succeed in all those things
together, whereof each one of the saints hath performed only a
part. But when one and the same person is found to possess all,
what excuse will they have, who after the law and grace are not
able to attain unto the same measure with them that were before the
law and grace? How then did this Patriarch overcome and subdue
this monster, when he had a dispute with his nephew? (<scripRef passage="Gen. xiii. 8" id="iv.xxxvi-p63.1" parsed="|Gen|13|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.13.8">Gen. xiii. 8</scripRef>.) For so it was, that coming
off worst and losing the first share, he was not vexed. But ye
know that in such matters the shame is worse than the loss to the
vulgar-minded, and particularly when a person having all in his own
power, as he had then, and having been the first to give honor, was
not honored in return. Nevertheless, none of these things vexed
him, but he was content to receive the second place, and when
wronged by the young man, himself old, an uncle by a nephew, he was
not indignant nor took it ill, but loved him equally and ministered
to him. Again, having been victorious in that great and terrible
fight, and having mightily put to flight the Barbarians (<scripRef passage="Gen. xiv" id="iv.xxxvi-p63.2" parsed="|Gen|14|0|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.14">Gen. xiv</scripRef>.) he doth not add show to
victory, nor erect a trophy.  For he wished to save only, not to
exhibit himself. Again, he entertained strangers, yet did he not
here act vain-gloriously, but himself both ran to them and bowed
down to them, not as though he were giving, but receiving a
benefit, and he calleth them lords, without knowing who they are
who are come to him, and presents his wife in the place of a
handmaiden. (<scripRef passage="Gen. xviii" id="iv.xxxvi-p63.3" parsed="|Gen|18|0|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.18">Gen.
xviii</scripRef>.) And in Egypt
too before this, when he had appeared so extraordinary a person,
and had received back this very woman, his wife, and had enjoyed so
great honor (<scripRef passage="Gen. xii" id="iv.xxxvi-p63.4" parsed="|Gen|12|0|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.12">Gen. xii</scripRef>.) he showeth it to no man.
And though the inhabitants of the place called him prince, he
himself even laid down the price of the sepulchre. (<scripRef passage="Gen. xxiii. 6" id="iv.xxxvi-p63.5" parsed="|Gen|23|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.23.6">Gen. xxiii. 6</scripRef>.) And when he sent to
betroth a wife for his son, he gave no command to speak in high and
dignified terms of him, (<scripRef passage="Gen. xxiv" id="iv.xxxvi-p63.6" parsed="|Gen|24|0|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.24">Gen. xxiv</scripRef>.) but merely to bring the
bride.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvi-p64">[11.] Wilt thou examine also the conduct of those
under grace, when from every side great was the glory of the
teaching flowing round them, and wilt thou see then also this
passion cast out? Consider, I pray, this same Apostle who speaks
these things, how he ever ascribes the whole to God, how of his
sins he makes mention continually, but of his good deeds never,
unless perchance it should be needful to correct the disciples; and
even if he be compelled to do this, he calls the matter folly, and
yields the first place to Peter, and is not ashamed to labor with
Priscilla and Aquila, and every where he is eager to show himself
lowly, not swaggering in the market place, nor carrying crowds with
him, but setting himself down among the obscure. Wherefore also
he said, “but his bodily presence is weak.” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. x. 10" id="iv.xxxvi-p64.1" parsed="|2Cor|10|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.10.10">2 Cor. x. 10</scripRef>.) i.e., easy to be
despised, and not at all accompanied with display. And again,
“I pray that ye do no evil, not that we may appear approved.”
And what marvel if he despise this glory? seeing that he despises
the glory of heaven, and the kingdom, and hell, for that which was
pleasing unto Christ: for he wishes<note place="end" n="238" id="iv.xxxvi-p64.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxvi-p65"> [Rather he <i>could</i> wish, i.e., if it
were proper. C.]</p></note> himself to be accursed from Christ
for the glory of Christ. For if he saith that he is willing to
suffer this for the Jews’ sake, he saith it on this account that
none of those without understanding might think to take to himself
the promises made to them. If therefore he were ready to pass by
those things, what marvel is it if he despise human
things?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvi-p66">[12.] But the men of our time are overwhelmed by
all things, not by desire of glory only, but also, on the other
hand, by insult and fear of dishonor. Thus, should any one
praise, it would puff thee up, and if he blame, it would cast thee
down. And as weak bodies are by common accidents injured, so also
souls which grovel on earth. For such not poverty alone, but even
wealth destroys, not grief only, but likewise joy, and prosperity
more than adversity. For poverty compels to be wise, but wealth
leads on oftentimes into some great evil. And as men in a fever
are hard to be pleased in any thing, so also they that are depraved
in mind on every side receive hurt.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvi-p67">Knowing therefore these things, let us not shun
poverty, let us not admire riches: but prepare our soul to be
sufficient for all estates. For so any one building an house doth
not consider how neither rain may descend, nor sunbeam light on it,
(for this were impossible,) but how it may be made capable of
enduring all. And he again that builds a ship doth not fashion
and design any thing to keep waves from breaking against it, or any
tempest from rising in the sea: (for this too were impossible:) 
but that <pb n="214" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_214.html" id="iv.xxxvi-Page_214" />the sides of the ship
may be ready to meet all. And again, he that cares for the body
doth not look to this that there may be no inequality in the
temperature, but that the body may easily endure all these
things. So accordingly let us act in respect of the soul, and
neither be anxious to fly poverty nor to become rich, but to
regulate each of them for our own safety.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvi-p68">Wherefore, letting alone these things, let us render
our soul meet both for wealth and poverty. For although no
calamity, such as man is subject to, befall, which is for the most
part impossible, even thus, better is he that seeks not wealth, but
knows how to bear all things easily than he that is always rich.
And why? First, such an one hath his safety from within, but the
other from without. And as he is a better soldier who trusts to
his bodily powers and skill in fighting, than he that hath his
strength in his armor only; so he that relies on his wealth,
compared with him that is fenced in by his virtue, is inferior.
Secondly, because even if he do not fall into poverty, it is
impossible that he should be without trouble. For wealth hath
many storms and troubles; but not so virtue, but pleasure only and
safety. Yea, and it puts a man out of the reach of them that lay
snares for him, but wealth quite the contrary, rendering him easy
to be attacked and taken. And as among animals, stags and hares
are of all most easily taken through their natural timidity, but
the wild boar, and the bull, and the lion, would not easily fall in
the way of the liers-in-wait; just so one may see in the case of
the rich, and of them that live voluntarily in poverty.  The one
is like the lion and the bull, the other like the stag and the
hare. For whom doth not the rich man fear? Are there not
robbers, potentates, enviers, informers? And why speak I of
robbers and informers, in a case where a man suspects his very
domestics?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvi-p69">[13.] And why say I, “when he is alive?” Not
even when dead is he freed from the villainy of the robbers, nor
hath death power to set him in safety, but the evil doers despoil
him even when dead, so dangerous a thing is wealth. For not only
do they dig into houses, but they even burst open tombs and
coffins. What then can be more wretched than this man, since not
even death can furnish him with this security, but that wretched
body, even when deprived of life, is not freed from the evils of
life, those that commit such wickedness hastening to war even with
dust and ashes, and much more grievously than when it was alive? 
For then, it might be, entering his storehouse, they would remove
his chests, but abstain from his person, and would not take so much
as to strip the body itself but now the accursed hands of the
tombbreakers do not even abstain from these, but move and turn it
about, and with much cruelty insult it. For after it hath been
committed to the ground, having stripped it both of its covering of
earth and of that which its grave-clothes constitute, they leave it
thus to be cast out.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvi-p70">What foe then so deadly as wealth, which destroys
both the soul of the living, and insults the body of the dead, not
suffering it even to lie buried in the ground, which is common even
to the condemned and to them that have been taken in the vilest
crimes? For of them the legislators having exacted the punishment
of death, inquire no further; but of these, wealth even after death
exacts a most bitter punishment, exposing them naked and unburied,
a dreadful and pitiable spectacle: since even those who suffer
this after sentence and by the anger of their judges, do not suffer
so grievously as these. For they indeed remain unburied the first
and second day, and so are committed to the ground; but these, when
they have been committed to the ground, are then stripped naked and
insulted. And if the robbers depart without taking the coffin
too, there is still no thanks to their wealth, but in this case
also to their poverty. For she it is that guards it. Whereas
most assuredly, had we intruded wealth with even so much as this,
and leaving off to form it of stone, had forged it of gold, we
should have lost this also.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvi-p71">So faithless a thing is wealth; which belongs not so
much to them that have it, as to them that endeavor to seize it.
So that it is but a superfluous argument which aims to show that
wealth is irresistible, seeing that not even on the day of their
death do its possessors obtain security. And yet who is not
reconciled with the departed, whether it be wild beast, or demon,
or whatever else? The very sight being enough to bend even one
who is altogether iron, and quite past feeling. Wherefore, you
know, when one sees a corpse, though it be an enemy public or
private whom he sees, yet he weeps for him in common with his
dearest friends; and his wrath is extinguished with life, and pity
is brought in. And it would be impossible, in time of mourning
and carrying out of burial, to distinguish an enemy from him who is
not such. So greatly do all men revere their common nature, and
the customs which have been introduced respecting it. But wealth
not even on obtaining this, remits her anger against her
possessors; nay, it renders them that have been no way wronged
enemies of the dead; if at least to strip the dead body be an act
of persons very bitter and hostile. And nature for her part
reconciles even his enemies to him then: but wealth makes foes of
them that have noth<pb n="215" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_215.html" id="iv.xxxvi-Page_215" />ing to
accuse him of, and cruelly intreats the body in its utter
desolation. And yet in that case there are many things which
might lead one to pity, the fact of its being a corpse, its
inability to move, and tending to earth and corruption, the absence
of any one to help: but none of these things soften those
accursed wretches, because of the tyranny they are under from their
base cupidity. For the passion of covetousness, like some
ruthless tyrant, is at hand, enjoining those inhuman commands and
having made wild beasts of them, so brings them to the tombs.
Yea, like wild beasts attacking the dead, they would not even
abstain from their flesh, if their limbs were any way useful unto
them. Such is our enjoyment of wealth; to be insulted even after
death, and deprived of sepulture which even the most desperate
criminals obtain.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvi-p72">[14.] Are we still then, tell me, to be fond of so
grievous an enemy? Nay, I beseech you, nay, my brethren! but let
us fly from it without turning to look: and if it come into our
hands, let us not keep it within, but bind it fast by the hands of
the poor. For these are the bonds which have more power to hold
it, and from those treasuries it will never more escape; and so
this faithless one abides for the time to come faithful, tractable,
tame, the right hand of Mercy producing this effect on it.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvi-p73">As I have said then, if it ever come to us, let us
hand it over to her; but if it come not, let us not seek after it,
nor fret ourselves, nor count its possessors happy; for what sort
of a notion of happiness is this? Unless thou wouldest also say
that those who fight with beasts are to be envied, because those
high-priced animals are shut up and reserved by the proposers of
such contests for themselves: who however not daring themselves
to approach or to touch them, but fearing and trembling because of
them, hand over others to them. Something like this, I say, is
the case of the wealthy, when they have shut up their wealth in
their treasuries as if it were some savage beast, and day by day
receive from it innumerable wounds: in this latter unlike to the
beasts: since they, when thou leadest them out, then, and not
till then, hurt such as meet them: but this, when it is shut up
and preserved, then destroys its possessors and hoarders.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvi-p74">But let us make this beast tame. And it will be
tame, if we do not shut it up, but give it into the hands of all
who are in need. So shall we reap from this quarter the greatest
blessings, both living in the present life with safety and a good
hope, and in the day that is to come standing with boldness: to
which may we all attain, through the grace and mercy, &amp;c.

his long argument and demonstration he adopts a more vehement style
and abundance of rebuke; and mentions an example suited to the
subject. For children too are wont to gape after trifles and to
be fluttered, but of things very great they have not so much
admiration. Since then these also having the gift of tongues,
which was the lowest of all, thought they had the whole; therefore
he saith, “Be not children,” i.e., be not without understanding
where ye ought to be considerate, but there be ye childlike and
simple, where unrighteousness is, where vain-glory, where pride.
For he that is a babe in wickedness ought also to be wise. Since
as wisdom with wickedness would not be wisdom, so also simplicity
with folly would not be simplicity, it being requisite both in
simplicity to avoid folly, and in wisdom wickedness. For as
neither bitter nor sweet medicines in excess do good, so neither
doth simplicity by itself, nor wisdom: and this is why Christ
enjoining us to mix both said, “Be ye wise as serpents, and
harmless as doves.” (<scripRef passage="Matt. x. 16" id="iv.xxxvii-p4.2" parsed="|Matt|10|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.10.16">Matt. x. 16</scripRef>.)</p>

is fornication among you.” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. v. 1" id="iv.xxxvii-p5.1" parsed="|1Cor|5|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.5.1">1 Cor. v. 1</scripRef>.) He said not, “is
done,” but is “reported:” as if he said, “ye are not
without knowledge of the thing; ye have heard of it some time.”
I say, he would have them both to be men and children; the one
however in wickedness, but the other in wisdom. For so even the
man may become a man, if he be also a child: but as long as he
<pb n="216" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_216.html" id="iv.xxxvii-Page_216" />is not a child in wickedness,
neither will he be a man. For the wicked, instead of being
mature, will be but a fool.</p>

written, By men of strange tongues and by the lips of strangers
will I speak unto this people; and not even thus will they hear me,
saith the Lord.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvii-p7">Yet surely it is no where written in the Law, but as
I said before, he calls always the whole of the Old Testament, the
Law: both the prophets and the historical books. And he brings
forward his testimony from Esaias the prophet, again covertly
detracting from the glory of the gift, for their profit;
nevertheless, even thus he states it with praise. For the
expression, “not even thus,” hath force to point out that the
miracle was enough to astonish them; and if they did not believe,
the fault was theirs. And wherefore did God work it, if they were
not to believe? That He might in every case appear to do His
part.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvii-p8">[2.]  Having shown then even from the prophecy,
that the sign in question is not of great use, he adds,</p>

for a sign, not to them that believe, but to the unbelieving: but
prophesying is for a sign not to the unbelieving, but to them that
believe.”</p>

Church be assembled together, and all speak with tongues, and there
come in men unlearned or unbelieving, will they not say that ye are
mad?”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvii-p11"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 14.24" id="iv.xxxvii-p11.1" parsed="|1Cor|14|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.14.24">Ver. 24</scripRef>. “But if all prophesy, and

his heart are made manifest; and so he will fall down on his face
and worship God, declaring that God is among you indeed.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvii-p13">Great in this place is the difficulty which one
seems to find arising from what is said. For if tongues are for a
sign to them that believe not, how saith he, if they that believe
not should see you speaking with tongues, they will say that “ye
are mad?” And if prophecy be “not for the unbelieving, but
for them that believe,” how shall also the unbelievers gain
thereby?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvii-p14">“For if there come in,” saith he, “when ye are
prophesying, one that believeth not, he is reproved by all, and
judged.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvii-p15">And not only this, but also after this another
question hence springs up: since the tongue will appear on the
contrary greater than the prophecy. For if the tongues are for a
sign to the unbelieving, but prophecy to them that believe, that
which draws in aliens and makes of the household, is greater than
that which regulates those of the household. What then is the
meaning of that expression? Nothing difficult nor obscure, nor
contrary to what went before, but rather very agreeable to it, if
we give heed: viz., that prophecy is suitable to both, but then
tongue not so. Wherefore having said of the tongue, “it is for
a sign,” he adds, “not to them that believe, but to the
unbelievers,” and to them “for a sign,” i.e., for
astonishment, not so much for instruction.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvii-p16">“But in the case of prophecy too,” saith some
one, “he did the very same thing, saying, ‘but prophesying
serveth not for the unbelieving, but for them which believe.’
For the believer hath no need to see a sign, but requires only
teaching and catechizing. How then sayest thou,” saith he,
“that prophecy is of use to both, when Paul saith ‘not to the
unbelieving, but to them which believe?’” If thou wilt
accurately examine, thou wilt understand what is said. For he
said not, “prophecy is not useful to them unbelieving,” but,
“is not for a sign,” as the tongue,” i.e., a mere sign
without profit: nor is the tongue any way useful to believers;
for its only work is to astonish and to confound; the word
“sign” being one of those which may be taken two ways: as
when he saith, “show me a sign,” (<scripRef passage="Ps. lxxxvi. 17" id="iv.xxxvii-p16.1" parsed="|Ps|86|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.86.17">Ps. lxxxvi. 17</scripRef>.) and adds, “for good:”
and again, “I am become as a wonder unto many,” (<scripRef passage="Ps. lxxi. 7" id="iv.xxxvii-p16.2" parsed="|Ps|71|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.71.7">Ps. lxxi. 7</scripRef>.) i.e., a sign.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvii-p17">And to show thee that he introduced the term
“sign” here, not as a thing which of course did some good, he
added that which resulted from it. And what was this? “They
will say,” saith he, “that ye are mad.” This however not
from the nature of the sign, but from their folly. But when thou
hearest of unbelievers, do not suppose that the same persons are in
every case intended, but at one time they which are incurably
diseased and abide uncorrected, and at another they which may be
changed; such as were they who in the times of the Apostles admire
the mighty things of God which they hear of; such as in the case of
Cornelius. His meaning accordingly is this; that prophecy avails
both among the unbelieving and among them that believe: as to the
tongue, when heard by the unbelieving and inconsiderate, instead of
profiting by it, they rather deride the utterers as madmen. For,
in fact, it is to them but for a sign, i.e., in order to astonish
them merely; whereas they who had understanding used also to profit
by it: with a view to which the sign was given. Even as then
there were not only certain who accused them of drunkenness, but
many also admired them as relating the wonderful works of God. It
appears then that the mockers were those without understanding.
Wherefore also Paul did not simply say, “they will say that ye
are mad,” but added, “unlearned and unbelievers.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvii-p18"><pb n="217" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_217.html" id="iv.xxxvii-Page_217" />But prophecy is
not for a sign merely, but is also suitable and useful for faith
and for profit unto both classes. And this, if not directly, yet
in the sequel he more clearly explained, saying, “he is reproved
by all. For, if all prophesy,” saith he, “and there come in
one unbelieving or unlearned, he is reproved by all; he is judged
by all; and thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so
he will fall down on his face and worship God, declaring that God
is among you indeed.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvii-p19">So that not in this only is prophecy greater,
in its availing with each class<note place="end" n="239" id="iv.xxxvii-p19.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxvii-p20"> i.e. <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxxvii-p20.1">ἐν
ἀπίστοις καὶ πίστοις</span>.</p></note>, but also in its attracting the
more shameless of the unbelievers. For it was not the same
wonder, when Peter convicted<note place="end" n="240" id="iv.xxxvii-p20.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxvii-p21"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxxvii-p21.1">ἤ</span><span class="Greek" id="iv.xxxvii-p21.2">λεγξεν</span>.</p></note> Sapphira, which was a work of
prophecy, and when he spake with tongues: but in the former case
all shrank into themselves; whereas, when he spake with tongues, he
got the credit of being even beside himself.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvii-p22">[3.] Having said then, that a tongue
profited not, and having again qualified<note place="end" n="241" id="iv.xxxvii-p22.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxvii-p23"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxxvii-p23.1">ὑ</span><span class="Greek" id="iv.xxxvii-p23.2">ποτεμόμενος αὐτὸ τοῦτο</span>.</p></note> this statement by turning the
charge upon the Jews, he proceeds to signify that it even doth
injury. “And wherefore was it given?” That it might go
forth with interpretation: since without this, it hath even the
contrary effect among them that are without understanding. “For
if,” saith he, “all speak with tongues, and there come in
unbelievers or unlearned, they will say that ye are mad;” as
indeed even the Apostles incurred the suspicion of being drunken: 
for “these men,” it saith, “are filled with new wine: 
(<scripRef passage="Acts ii. 13" id="iv.xxxvii-p23.3" parsed="|Acts|2|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.2.13">Acts ii. 13</scripRef>.) but it is not the fault of
the sign, but of their unskilfulness; therefore he added,
“unlearned and unbelievers,” to show that the notion belongs to
their ignorance and want of faith; for, as I before said, his
object is to rank that gift not among things that are disparaged,
but among those which do not greatly profit, and this, in order to
repress them, and bring them to a necessity of seeking for an
interpreter. For since the greater part looked not to this, but
made use of it for display and rivalry, this is what he especially
withdraws them from, intimating that their credit is injured, they
bringing on themselves a suspicion of madness. And this
especially is what Paul continually attempts to establish, when he
wants to lead men away from any thing: he shows that the person
suffers loss in respect of those very things which he desires.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvii-p24">And do thou accordingly likewise: if thou wouldest
lead men away from pleasure, show that the thing is bitter: if
thou wouldest withdraw them from vain-glory, show that the thing is
full of dishonor: thus also was Paul used to do. When he would
tear away the rich from their love of money, he said not merely
that wealth is a hurtful thing, but also that it casts into
temptations. “For they that desire to be rich,” saith he,”
fall into a temptation.” (<scripRef passage="1 Tim. vi. 9" id="iv.xxxvii-p24.1" parsed="|1Tim|6|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.6.9">1 Tim. vi. 9</scripRef>.) Thus, since it seems
to deliver from temptations, he attributes to it the contrary of
that which the rich supposed. Others again held fast by the
wisdom that is without, as though by it establishing Christ’s
doctrine; he signifies that not only it gives no aid to the cross,
but even makes it void. They held to going to law before
strangers, thinking it unmeet to be judged by their own, as if
those without were wiser: he points out that going to law before
them that are without is shameful. They clave to things offered
in sacrifice to idols, as displaying perfect knowledge: he
intimates that this is a mark of imperfect knowledge, not to know
how to manage in the things which concern our neighbors. So also
here, because they were wild<note place="end" n="242" id="iv.xxxvii-p24.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxvii-p25"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxxvii-p25.1">ἐ</span><span class="Greek" id="iv.xxxvii-p25.2">πτόηντο</span>.</p></note> about this gift of tongues, through
their love of glory, he signifies that this on the other hand more
than any thing brings shame upon them, not only depriving them of
glory, but also involving them in a suspicion of madness. But he
did not at once say this, but having spoken very many things
before, when he had made his discourse acceptable, then he brings
in that topic so very contrary to their opinion. And this in fact
is no more than the common rule; that he who intends thoroughly to
shake a deep-rooted opinion and to turn men round to its contrary,
must not at once state the opposites: otherwise he will be
ridiculous in the eyes of them that are preoccupied by the contrary
conviction. Since that which is very much beside expectation
cannot be from the beginning easily received, but you must first
well undermine by other arguments, and then give it the contrary
turn.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvii-p26">Thus for example he did when discoursing of
marriage: I mean, since many regarded it as a thing which brings
ease, and he wished to intimate that the abstaining from marriage
was ease; if he had said this at once he would not so easily have
made it acceptable: whereas now, having stated it after much
other matter and timing its introduction exactly, he strongly
touched the hearers. This also he did in respect of virginity.
For before this having said much, and after this again, at last he
saith, “I spare you,” and, “I would have you to be free from
cares.” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. vii. 28, 32" id="iv.xxxvii-p26.1" parsed="|1Cor|7|28|0|0;|1Cor|7|32|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.7.28 Bible:1Cor.7.32">1 Cor. vii.
28, 32</scripRef>.)</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvii-p27">This then he doth in respect of the tongues, showing
that they not only deprive of glory, but also bring shame upon
those who have them in the eyes of the unbelievers. But prophecy,
on the contrary, is both free from reproach among the unbelievers,
and hath very great 
<pb n="218" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_218.html" id="iv.xxxvii-Page_218" />credit and usefulness. For none will say
in regard to prophesying, “they are mad;” nor will any one
deride them that prophesy; but, on the contrary, will be astonished
at and admire them. For “he is reproved by all,” i.e., the
things which he hath in his heart, are brought forward and shown
unto all:  now it is not the same thing for any one to come in and
see one speaking in Persian and another in Syriac, and to come in
and hear the secrets of his own mind; as whether he cometh in as a
tempter and with evil mind, or sincerely; or that such and such a
thing hath been done by him, and such another designed. For this
is much more awful and more profitable than the other. For this
cause therefore, whereas of the tongues he saith, “ye are mad;”
not however affirming this of himself, but of their judgment: 
i.e., “they will say,” saith he, “that ye are mad;” here,
on the contrary, he makes use both of the verdict of the facts<note place="end" n="243" id="iv.xxxvii-p27.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxvii-p28"> i.e., the actions of the man’s life, and his
conscience, which answers to the prophecy.</p></note>, and that of
those who are the objects of the benefit. “For he is reproved
by all,” saith he, “he is judged by all; and thus are the
secrets of his heart made manifest; and so he will fall down on his
face and worship God, declaring that God is around you indeed.
Seest thou that this is not capable of two interpretations: how
in the former case what is done may be doubted of, and here and
there an unbeliever might ascribe it to madness? whereas here there
will be no such thing, but he will both wonder and worship, first
making a confession by his deeds, and then by his words also.
Thus also Nebuchadnezzar worshipped God, saying, “Of a truth,
your God, He is the God that revealeth secrets, seeing thou
couldest reveal this secret.” (<scripRef passage="Dan. ii. 47" id="iv.xxxvii-p28.1" parsed="|Dan|2|47|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Dan.2.47">Dan. ii. 47</scripRef>.) Seest thou the might of
prophecy, how it changed that savage one and brought him under
instruction and introduced him to faith?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvii-p29">[4.] <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 14.26" id="iv.xxxvii-p29.1" parsed="|1Cor|14|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.14.26">Ver. 26</scripRef>. “What is it then,
brethren? When ye come together, each one hath a psalm, hath a
teaching, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an
interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvii-p30">Seest thou the foundation and the rule of
Christianity? how, as it is the artificer’s work to build, so it
is the Christian’s to profit his neighbors in all things.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvii-p31">But since he had vehemently run down the gift; lest
it might seem to be superfluous, for with a view to pull down their
pride and no more, he did this:—again he reckons it with the
other gifts, saying, “hath a psalm, hath a teaching, hath a
tongue.” For of old they used also to make psalms by a gift and
to teach by a gift. Nevertheless, “let all these look to one
thing,” saith he, “the correction of their neighbor: let
nothing be done at random. For if thou comest not to edify thy
brother, why dost thou come here at all? In fact, I do not make
much account of the difference of the gifts. One thing concerns
me, one thing is my desire, to do all things “unto edifying.”
Thus also he that hath the lesser gift will outrun him that hath
the greater, if this be not wanting. Yea, therefore are the gifts
bestowed, that each might be edified; since unless this take place,
the gift will rather turn to the condemnation of the receiver.
For what, tell me, is the use of prophesying? What is the use of
raising the dead, when there is none who profits by it? But if
this be the end of the gifts, and if it be possible to effect it in
another way without gifts, boast not thyself on the score of the
signs, nor do thou bewail thyself to whom the gifts are denied.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvii-p32">[5.] <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 14.27" id="iv.xxxvii-p32.1" parsed="|1Cor|14|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.14.27">Ver. 27</scripRef>. “And if any man speaketh
in a tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and that in

interpreter, let him keep silence in the Church; and let him speak
to himself, and to God.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvii-p34">What sayest thou, tell me? Having spoken so
much of tongues, that the gift is a thing unprofitable, a thing
superfluous, if it have no interpreter, dost thou command again to
speak with tongues? I do not command, saith he, neither do I
forbid; as when he saith, “if any of them that believe not bid
you to a feast and ye be disposed to go,” he saith it not laying
down a law for them to go, but not hindering them: so likewise
here. “And let him speak to himself and to God.” If he
endure not to be silent, saith he, but is so ambitious and
vain-glorious, “let him speak by himself.<note place="end" n="244" id="iv.xxxvii-p34.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxvii-p35"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxxvii-p35.1">καθ̓ ἑαυτόν</span>.</p></note>” And thus, by the very fact of
so permitting, he greatly checked and put them to shame. Which he
doth also elsewhere, discoursing of converse with a wife and
saying, “But this I say because of your incontinency.” But
not so did he speak, when he was discoursing of prophecy. How
then? In a tone of command and legislation: “Let the prophets
speak, two or three.” And he no where here seeks the
interpreter, nor doth he stop the mouth of him that prophesies as
under the former head, saying, “If there be no interpreter, let
him keep silence;” because in fact he who speaks in a tongue is
not sufficient of himself. Wherefore if any hath both gifts, let
him speak. But if he hath not, yet wish to speak, let him do so
with the interpreter’s aid. For the prophet is an interpreter,
but of God; whereas thou art of man. “But if there be no
interpreter, let him keep silence:” for nothing ought to be
done superfluously, nothing for ambition. Only “let him speak
to <pb n="219" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_219.html" id="iv.xxxvii-Page_219" />himself and to
God;” i.e., mentally, or quietly and without noise: at least,
if he will speak. For this is surely not the tone of one making a
law, but it may be of one who shames them more even by his
permission; as when he saith, “but if any hunger, let him eat at
home:” and seeming to give permission, he touches them hereby
the more sharply. “For ye come not together for this
purpose,” saith he, “that ye may show that ye have a gift, but
that ye may edify the hearers;” which also he before said, “Let
all things be done unto edifying.”</p>

by two or three, and let the others discern.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvii-p37">No where hath he added, “at the most,” as in the
case of the tongues. And how is this, one saith? For he makes
out that neither is prophesy sufficient in itself, if at least he
permitteth the judgment to others. Nay, surely it is quite
sufficient; and this is why he did not stop the mouth of the
prophet, as of the other, when there is no interpreter; nor, as in
his case he said, “if there be no interpreter let him keep
silence,” so also in the case of the prophet, “if there be none
to discern, let him not prophesy;” but he only secured the
hearer; since for the satisfaction of the hearers he said this,
that no diviner might throw himself in among them. For of this
also at the beginning he bade them beware, when he introduced a
distinction between divination and prophecy, and now he bids them
discriminate and spy out the matter, so that no Satanic teacher
might privily enter.</p>

one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvii-p40">What may this be which is spoken? “If when
thou prophesiest,” saith he, “and art speaking, the spirit of
another stir him up, be silent thenceforth.” For that which he
said in the case of the tongues, this also here he requires, that
it should be done “in turn,” only in a diviner way here. For
he made not use of the very expression, “in turn<note place="end" n="245" id="iv.xxxvii-p40.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxvii-p41"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxxvii-p41.1">ἀνὰ

“if a revelation be made to another.” Since what need was
there further, that when the second was moved to prophesy the first
should speak? Ought they then both? Nay, this were profane and
would produce confusion. Ought the first? This too were out of
place. For to this end when the one was speaking, the Spirit
moved the other, in order that he too might say
somewhat.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvii-p42">So then, comforting him that had been silenced, he
saith, “For ye all can prophesy one by one, that all may learn,
and all may be comforted.” Seest thou how again he states the
reason wherefore he doeth all things? For if him that speaks with
tongues he altogether forbid to speak, when he hath not an
interpreter, because of the unprofitableness; reasonably also he
bids restrain prophecy, if it have not this quality, but createth
confusion and disturbance and unseasonable tumult.</p>

prophets are subject to the prophets.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvii-p44">Seest thou how he put him to shame earnestly and
fearfully? For that the man might not strive nor be factious, he
signifies that the gift itself was under subjection. For by
“spirit” here, he means its actual working. But if the spirit
be subject, much more thou its possessor canst not justly be
contentious.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvii-p48">Seest thou by how many reasons he leads him to
silence and soothes him, in the act of giving way to the other? 
By one thing and that the chief, that he was not shut up by such a
proceeding; “for ye all can prophesy,” saith he, “one by
one.” By a second, that this seems good to the Spirit Himself;
“for the spirits of the prophets are subject to the
prophets.” Besides these, that this is according to the mind of
God; “for God,” saith he, “is not a God of confusion, but of
peace:” and by a fourth, that in every part of the world this
custom prevails, and no strange thing is enjoined upon them. For
thus, saith he, “I teach in all the Churches of the
saints.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvii-p49">What now can be more awful than these
things? For in truth the Church was a heaven then, the Spirit
governing all things, and moving each one of the rulers and making
him inspired. But now we retain only the symbols of those
gifts. For now also we speak two or three, and in turn, and when
one is silent, another begins. But these are only signs and
memorials of those things. Wherefore when we begin to speak, the
people respond, “with thy Spirit<note place="end" n="247" id="iv.xxxvii-p49.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxvii-p50"> The “Anaphora,” or more solemn part of the
Liturgy begins with the Versicle and Response here alluded to, in
the Clementine Liturgy, and in those of St. Mark, St. Chrysostom,
St. Basil, and the Roman Missal.</p></note>,” indicating that of old they
thus used to speak, not of their own wisdom, but moved by the
Spirit. But not so now: (I speak of mine own case so far.) 
But the present Church is like a woman who hath fallen from her
former prosperous days, and in many respects retains the symbols
only of that ancient prosperity; displaying indeed the repositories
and caskets of <pb n="220" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_220.html" id="iv.xxxvii-Page_220" />her
golden ornaments, but bereft of her wealth: such an one doth the
present Church resemble. And I say not this in respect of
gifts: for it were nothing marvelous if it were this only: but
in respect also of life and virtue. Thus the list of her widows,
and the choir of her virgins, then gave great ornament to the
churches: but now she is made desolate and void, and the tokens
only remain. There are indeed widows now, there are also virgins;
but they retain not that adornment which women should have who
prepare themselves for such wrestlings. For the special
distinction of the virgin is the caring for the things of God
alone, and the waiting on Him without distraction: and the
widow’s mark too should be not so much the not engaging in a
second marriage, as the other things, charity to the poor,
hospitality, continuing instant in prayers, all those other things,
which Paul writing to Timothy requires with great exactness. One
may see also the married women exhibiting among us great
seemliness. But this is not the only thing required, but rather
that sedulous attention to the needy, through which those women of
old shone out most brightly. Not as the generality now-a-days.
For then instead of gold they were clothed with the fair array of
almsgiving: but now, having left off this, they are decked out on
every side with cords of gold woven of the chain of their sins.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvii-p51">Shall I speak of another repository too emptied of
its hereditary splendor? They all met together in old time and
sang psalms in common. This we do also now: but then among all
was there one soul and one heart: but now not in one single soul
can one see that unanimity, rather great is the warfare every
where.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvii-p52">“Peace,” even now, “to all,”<note place="end" n="248" id="iv.xxxvii-p52.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxvii-p53"> See Bingham, xiii. 8. 13.; S. Chrys. 3 Hom. in
Coloss. t. iv. 106. Ed. Savile.</p></note> he that
presides in the Church prays for, entering as it were into his
Father’s house: but of this peace the name is frequent, but the
reality no where.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvii-p54">[8.] Then the very houses were churches: but now
the church itself is a house, or rather worse than any house. For
in a house one may see much good order: since both the mistress
of the house is seated on her chair with all seemliness, and the
maidens weave in silence, and each of the domestics hath his
appointed task in hand. But here great is the tumult, great the
confusion, and our assemblies differ in nothing from a vintner’s
shop, so loud is the laughter, so great the disturbance; as in
baths, as in markets, the cry and tumult is universal. And these
things are here only: since elsewhere it is not permitted even to
address one’s neighbor in the church, not even if one have
received back a long absent friend, but these things are done
without, and very properly. For the church is no barber’s or
perfumer’s shop, nor any other merchant’s warehouse in the
market-place, but a place of angels, a place of archangels, a
palace of God, heaven itself. As therefore if one had parted the
heaven and had brought thee in thither, though thou shouldest see
thy father or thy brother, thou wouldest not venture to speak; so
neither here ought one to utter any other sound but these which are
spiritual. For, in truth, the things in this place are also a
heaven.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvii-p55">And if thou believest not, look to this table, call
to mind for Whose sake it is set, and why: consider Who it is
that is coming forth here; tremble with awe even before the time.
For so, when one sees the throne only of a king, in heart he rises
up, expecting the king’s coming forth. And do thou accordingly
thrill with awe even before that thrilling moment: raise up
thyself, and before thou seest the veils drawn aside and the choir
of angels marching forth, ascend thou to the very heaven.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvii-p56">But the uninitiated knows not these things. Well
then, it is necessary with a view to him also to introduce other
topics. For neither towards him shall we want reasons able to
stir him up thoroughly and cause him to soar.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvii-p57">Thou then who knowest not these things, when
thou shalt hear the prophet<note place="end" n="249" id="iv.xxxvii-p57.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxvii-p58"> Because the Catechumens and others, as it seems,
were allowed to hear the Lessons read, though not to be present at
what was strictly called the Communion Service. See Bingham, xiv.
iii. 1.</p></note> saying, “Thus saith the Lord,”
quit the earth, ascend thou also unto heaven, consider who it is
that by him discourses with thee.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvii-p59">But as things are, for a buffoon who is moving
laughter or for a whorish and abandoned woman, so vast an
assemblage of spectators is set, listening in entire quietness to
what is spoken, and this when none commands silence<note place="end" n="250" id="iv.xxxvii-p59.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxvii-p60"> An allusion to the injunctions for silence used by
the Deacon occasionally in the Church: see Bingham, ii. 20. 14: 
and the Apost. Constit. ii. 57. as quoted by him; “Let the Deacon
oversee the people, that none whisper, or doze, or laugh, or
nod;” and afterwards in the time of the offering, “Let some of
the Deacons observe the people, and make silence among them.”
Chrys. Hom. 24. on Acts, says, “Prayer is going on, and here are
young persons talking and jesting with one another even while on
their knees. Do thou who standest by, young or old, rebuke them,
if thou seest it; reprimand them more sharply; if he take it not
well, call the Deacon.”</p></note>; and there
is neither tumult, nor cry, nor any the least noise: but when God
is speaking from heaven on subjects so awful, we behave ourselves
more impudently than dogs, and even to the harlot women we pay
greater respect than to God.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvii-p61">Doth it make your flesh creep to be told of these
things? Nay then, much rather let it creep when ye do them.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvii-p62">[9.] That which Paul said of them that despised
the poor and feasted alone, “What, have ye not houses to eat and
to drink in? or despise ye the Church of God, and shame them that
<pb n="221" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_221.html" id="iv.xxxvii-Page_221" />have not?” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. xi. 22" id="iv.xxxvii-p62.1" parsed="|1Cor|11|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.11.22">1 Cor. xi. 22</scripRef>.)—the same allow me also to
say of those who make a disturbance and hold conversations in this
place. “What? have ye not houses to trifle in? or despise ye
the Church of God, and corrupt those even who would be modest and
quiet?” “But it is sweet and pleasant for you to converse
with your friends.” I do not forbid this, but let it be done in
the house, in the market, in the baths. For the church is not a
place of conversation, but of teaching. But now it differs not
from the market; nay, if it be not too bold a word, haply, not even
from the stage; in such sort do the women who assemble here adorn
themselves more wantonly than the unchaste who are to be found
there. Accordingly we see that even hither many profligates are
enticed by them; and if any one is trying or intending to corrupt a
woman, there is no place, I suppose, that seems to him more
suitable than the church. And if anything be to be sold or
bought, the church appears more convenient than the market. For
on such subjects also there is more talk here than in the shops
themselves. Or if any wish to say or to hear any scandal, you
will find that this too is to be had here more than in the forum
without. And if you wish to hear any thing of political matters,
or the affairs of private families, or the camp, go not to the
judgment-hall, nor sit in the apothecary’s shop; for here, here I
say are those who report all these things more accurately; and our
assemblies are any thing rather than a church.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvii-p63">Can it be that I have touched you to the quick? I
for my part think not. For while ye continue in the same
practices, how am I to know that you are touched by what hath been
said? Therefore I must needs handle the same topics again.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvii-p64">Are these things then to be endured? Are these
things to be borne? We weary and distract ourselves every day
that ye may not depart without having learned something useful: 
and none of you go away at all the better, but rather injured the
more. Yea, and “ye come together unto judgment,” having no
longer any cloak for your sin, and ye thrust out the more modest,
disturbing them with your fooleries on every side.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvii-p65">But what do the multitude say? “I do not hear
what is read,” saith one, “nor do I know what the words are
which are spoken.” Because thou makest a tumult and confusion,
because thou comest not with a reverent soul. What sayest thou? 
“I know not what things are said.” Well then, for this very
reason oughtest thou to give heed. But if not even the obscurity
stir up thy soul, much more if things were clear wouldest thou
hurry them by. Yea, this is the reason why neither all things are
clear, lest thou shouldest indulge indolence; nor obscure, lest
thou shouldest be in despair.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvii-p66">And whereas that eunuch and barbarian (<scripRef passage="Acts viii. 20" id="iv.xxxvii-p66.1" parsed="|Acts|8|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.8.20">Acts viii. 20</scripRef>.) said none of these
things, but surrounded as he was with a crowd of so important
affairs and on his journey, had a book in his hands and was
reading: dost thou, both abounding in teachers, and having others
to read to thee privately<note place="end" n="251" id="iv.xxxvii-p66.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxvii-p67"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxxvii-p67.1">ὑ</span><span class="Greek" id="iv.xxxvii-p67.2">παναγινώσκοντας</span>, perhaps, ‘repeating what is
read in a lower tone.’</p></note>, allege to me thine excuses and
pretexts? Knowest thou not what is said? Why then pray that
thou mayest learn: but sure it is impossible to be ignorant of
all things. For many things are of themselves evident and
clear. And further, even if thou be ignorant of all, even so
oughtest thou to be quiet, not to put out them that are attentive;
that God, accepting thy quietness and thy reverence, may make the
obscure things also plain. But canst thou not be silent?  Well
then, go out, not to become a mischief to others also.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvii-p68">For in truth there ought to be but one voice in the
church always, even as there is but one body. Therefore both he
that reads utters his voice alone, and the Bishop himself is
content to sit in silence; and he who chants chants alone; and
though all utter the response, the voice is wafted as from one
mouth. And he that pronounces a homily pronounces it alone. But
when there are many conversing on many and diverse subjects, why do
we disturb you for no good? since surely unless ye thought that we
are but disturbing you for no good, ye would not in the midst of
our speech on such high matters, discourse on things of no
consequence.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvii-p69">[10.] Therefore not in your conduct only, but in
your very estimation of things, there is great perversion. And ye
gape after superfluities, and leaving the truth pursue all sorts of
shadows and dreams. Are not all present things a shadow and
dreams, and worse than a shadow? For both before they appear,
they fly away; and before they are flown, the trouble they give is
much, and more than the pleasure. Let one acquire in this world
and bury in the earth ever such abundance of wealth, yet when the
night is past, naked he shall depart hence, and no wonder. Since
they too who are rich but in a dream, on rising from their couch
have nothing of what they seemed to have while sleeping. So also
are the greedy of gain: or rather not so, but in a much worse
condition. For he that dreams of being rich, neither hath the
money which he fancied he had, nor is any other mischief found to
have accrued to him from this phantasy when he arises, but this man
is both deprived of his riches, and hath also to depart, filled
with the sins which arise out of them; and in his wealth having but
enjoyed a phantasy, <pb n="222" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_222.html" id="iv.xxxvii-Page_222" />the evils
resulting from his wealth he sees not in fancy any more, but in the
very truth of things; and his pleasure was in dreams, but the
punishment ensuing on his pleasure turns out no more a dream, but
is matter of actual experience. Yea rather, even before that
punishment, even here he pays the heaviest penalty, in the very
collecting of his wealth wearing into himself innumerable
sadnesses, anxieties, accusations, calumnies, tumults,
perturbations.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxvii-p70">In order therefore that we may be delivered both
from the dreams and from the evils that are not in dreams, instead
of covetousness let us choose almsgiving, instead of rapine, mercy
to mankind. For thus we shall obtain the good things both present
and to come, through the grace and mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ,
with Whom, to the Father, with the Holy Ghost, be glory, power,
honor, now and ever, and world without end. Amen.</p>

<p class="c27" id="iv.xxxviii-p3">Let your women keep silence in the churches: for
it is not permitted unto them to speak; but let them be in
subjection, as also saith the law.</p>

<p class="c24" id="iv.xxxviii-p4"><span class="c18" id="iv.xxxviii-p4.1">Having</span> abated the
disturbance both from the tongues and from the prophesyings; and
having made a law to prevent confusion, that they who speak with
tongues should do this in turn, and that they who prophesy should
be silent when another begins; he next in course proceeds to the
disorder which arose from the women, cutting off their unseasonable
boldness of speech: and that very opportunely. For if to them
that have the gifts it is not permitted to speak inconsiderately,
nor when they will, and this, though they be moved by the Spirit;
much less to those women who prate idly and to no purpose.
Therefore he represses their babbling with much authority, and
taking the law along with him, thus he sews up their mouths; not
simply exhorting here or giving counsel, but even laying his
commands on them vehemently, by the recitation of an ancient law on
that subject. For having said, “Let your women keep silence in
the churches;” and “it is not permitted unto them to speak, but
let them be in subjection;” he added, “as also saith the
law.” And where doth the law say this? “Thy desire shall be
to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.” (<scripRef passage="Gen. iii. 16" id="iv.xxxviii-p4.2" parsed="|Gen|3|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.3.16">Gen. iii. 16</scripRef>.) Seest thou the wisdom of
Paul, what kind of testimony he adduced, one that not only enjoins
on them silence, but silence too with fear; and with as great fear
as that wherewith a maid servant ought to keep herself quiet.
Wherefore also having himself said, “it is not permitted unto
them to speak,” he added not, “but to be silent,” but instead
of “to be silent,” he set down what is more, to wit, “the
being in subjection.” And if this be so in respect of husbands,
much more in respect of teachers, and fathers, and the general
assembly of the Church. “But if they are not even to speak,”
saith one, “nor ask a question, to what end are they to be
present?” That they may hear what they ought; but the points
which are questioned let them learn at home from their husbands.
Wherefore also he added,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxviii-p5"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 14.35" id="iv.xxxviii-p5.1" parsed="|1Cor|14|35|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.14.35">Ver. 35</scripRef>. “And if they would learn
any thing, let them ask their own husbands at home.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxviii-p6">Thus, “not only, as it seems, are they not allowed
to speak,” saith he, “at random, but not even to ask any
question in the church.” Now if they ought not to ask
questions, much more is their speaking at pleasure contrary to
law. And what may be the cause of his setting them under so great
subjection? Because the woman is in some sort a weaker being and
easily carried away and light minded. Here you see why he set
over them their husbands as teachers, for the benefit of both.
For so he both rendered the women orderly, and the husbands he made
anxious, as having to deliver to their wives very exactly what they
heard.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxviii-p7">Further, because they supposed this to be an
ornament to them, I mean their speaking in public; again he brings
round the discourse to the opposite point, saying, “For it is
shameful for a woman to speak in the church.” That is, first he
made this out from the law of God, then from common reason and our
received custom; even when he was discoursing with the women about
long hair, he said, “Doth not even nature herself teach you?”
(c. <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 11.14" id="iv.xxxviii-p7.1" parsed="|1Cor|11|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.11.14">xi. 14</scripRef>.) And everywhere thou mayest
find this to be his manner, not only from the divine Scriptures,
but also from the common custom, to put them to shame.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxviii-p8">[2.] But besides these things, he also shames them
by consideration of what all agreed on, 
<pb n="223" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_223.html" id="iv.xxxviii-Page_223" />and what was every where prescribed; which topic
also here he hath set down, saying,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxviii-p9"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 14.36" id="iv.xxxviii-p9.1" parsed="|1Cor|14|36|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.14.36">Ver. 36</scripRef>. “What? was it from you
that the word of God went forth? or came it unto you alone?”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxviii-p10">Thus he brings in the other Churches also as holding
this law, both abating the disturbance by consideration of the
novelty of the thing, and by the general voice making his saying
acceptable. Wherefore also elsewhere he said, “Who shall put
you in remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, even as I teach
everywhere in all the Churches.” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. iv. 17" id="iv.xxxviii-p10.1" parsed="|1Cor|4|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.4.17">1 Cor. iv. 17</scripRef>.) And again, “God is not a
God of confusion, but of peace, as in all the Churches of the
saints.” (c. <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 14.33" id="iv.xxxviii-p10.2" parsed="|1Cor|14|33|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.14.33">xiv. 33</scripRef>.) And here, “What?
was it from you that the word of God went forth? or came it unto
you alone?” i.e., “neither first, nor alone are ye believers,
but the whole world<note place="end" n="252" id="iv.xxxviii-p10.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxviii-p11"> <scripRef passage="Rom. i. 8" id="iv.xxxviii-p11.1" parsed="|Rom|1|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.1.8">Rom. i.
8</scripRef>. <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxxviii-p11.2"> καταγγέλλεται</span>.</p></note>.” Which also writing to the
Colossians he said, “even as it is bearing fruit and increasing
in all the world,” (<scripRef passage="Col. i. 6" id="iv.xxxviii-p11.3" parsed="|Col|1|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Col.1.6">Col. i. 6</scripRef>.) speaking of the Gospel.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxviii-p12">But he turns it also at another time to the
encouragement of his hearers; as when he saith that theirs were the
first fruits, and were manifest unto all. Thus, writing to the
Thessalonians he said, “For from you hath sounded forth the word
of God,” and, “in every place your faith to God-ward is gone
forth.” (<scripRef passage="1 Thess. i. 8" id="iv.xxxviii-p12.1" parsed="|1Thess|1|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Thess.1.8">1 Thess. i.
8</scripRef>.) And again to
the Romans, “Your faith is proclaimed throughout the whole
world.” For both are apt to shame and stir up, as well the
being commended of others, as that they have others partakers in
their judgment. Wherefore also here he saith; “What? was it
from you that the word of God went forth? or came it unto you
only?” “For neither can ye say this,” saith he; “we were
made teachers to the rest, and it cannot be right for us to learn
of others;” nor, “the faith remained in this place only, and no
precedents from other quarters ought to be received.” Seest
thou by how many arguments he put them to shame? He introduced
the law, he signified the shamefulness of the thing, he brought
forward the other Churches.<note place="end" n="253" id="iv.xxxviii-p12.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxviii-p13"> [The sharp rebuke contained in this verse is
restricted by Meyer to the regulation laid down respecting women,
but it rather refers, as Chrysostom views it, to all the points
touched upon in the preceding discussion. As Principal Edwards
says, “The Corinthians acted as if they had originated the Gospel
or were the only Christian Church; that is, as if the Gospel took
its coloring from local influences and were not broad as humanity
itself nor destined to survive nationalities.” He thinks too
that it is a question whether they asked the Apostle’s advice as
touching the Spiritual gifts, as the way in which that subject is
introduced in the <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 12.1;14.36" id="iv.xxxviii-p13.1" parsed="|1Cor|12|1|0|0;|1Cor|14|36|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.12.1 Bible:1Cor.14.36">first verse of the twelfth chapter</scripRef> as well as
the words of this verse make it doubtful. C.]</p></note></p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxviii-p14">[3.] Next, what is strongest of all he puts last,
saying, “God ordains these things even at this time by me.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxviii-p15"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 14.37" id="iv.xxxviii-p15.1" parsed="|1Cor|14|37|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.14.37">Ver. 37</scripRef>. Thus: “if any man
thinketh himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him take
knowledge of the things which I write unto you that they are the
commandments of the Lord.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxviii-p16"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 14.38" id="iv.xxxviii-p16.1" parsed="|1Cor|14|38|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.14.38">Ver. 38</scripRef>. “But if any man is
ignorant, let him be ignorant.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxviii-p17">And wherefore did he add this? Intimating that he
is not using violence nor contention, which is a sign of them who
wish not to set up their own things, but aim at what is profitable
to others. Wherefore also in another place he saith, “But if
any man seemeth to be contentious, we have no such custom.”
(<scripRef passage="1 Cor. xi. 16" id="iv.xxxviii-p17.1" parsed="|1Cor|11|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.11.16">1 Cor. xi. 16</scripRef>.) But he doth not this
everywhere, but only where the offences are not very great, and
then rather as putting them to shame. Since when he discourses of
other sins, he speaks not thus. But how? “Be not deceived: 
neither fornicators, nor effeminate, shall inherit the kingdom of
God.” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. vi. 9, 10" id="iv.xxxviii-p17.2" parsed="|1Cor|6|9|6|10" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.6.9-1Cor.6.10">1 Cor. vi. 9,
10</scripRef>.) And again,
“Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye receive circumcision,
Christ will profit you nothing.” (<scripRef passage="Gal. v. 2" id="iv.xxxviii-p17.3" parsed="|Gal|5|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gal.5.2">Gal. v. 2</scripRef>.) But here, since his
discourse was of silence, he doth not very keenly inveigh against
them, by this very thing attracting them the more. Then, as he is
ever wont to do, unto the former subject whence he digressed to say
these things, he brings back his discourse as follows:</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxviii-p18"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 14.39" id="iv.xxxviii-p18.1" parsed="|1Cor|14|39|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.14.39">Ver. 39</scripRef>. “Wherefore, brethren,
desire earnestly to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with
tongues.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxviii-p19">For this too is his wont, not only to work out what
is before him, but also starting from that to set right whatever
seems to him in any way akin to it, and again to return to the
former, so as not to appear to wander from the subject. For so
when he was discoursing of their concord in their banquets, he
digressed to their Communion in the Mysteries, and having thence
put them to shame, he returns again to the former, saying,
“Wherefore, when ye come together to eat, wait one for
another.” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. xi. 33" id="iv.xxxviii-p19.1" parsed="|1Cor|11|33|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.11.33">1 Cor. xi.
33</scripRef>.)</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxviii-p20">And here, accordingly, having discoursed of
good order in their gifts, and of its being a duty neither to faint
in the lesser, nor to be puffed up on account of the greater; then
having made an excursion from thence to the sobriety becoming women
and having established it, he returns again to his subject, saying,
“Wherefore, brethren, desire earnestly to prophesy, and forbid
not to speak with tongues.” Seest thou how to the end he
preserved the difference of these? And how he signifies that the
one is very necessary, the other not so? Wherefore of the one he
saith, “desire earnestly<note place="end" n="254" id="iv.xxxviii-p20.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxviii-p21"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxxviii-p21.1">ζηλοῦτε</span>.</p></note>,” but of the other, “forbid
not.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxviii-p22">[4.] Then, as in brief summary, setting all things
right, he adds the words,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxviii-p23"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 14.40" id="iv.xxxviii-p23.1" parsed="|1Cor|14|40|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.14.40">Ver. 40</scripRef>. “Let all things be done
decently and in order.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxviii-p24"><pb n="224" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_224.html" id="iv.xxxviii-Page_224" />Again giving a
blow to them who chose to behave themselves unseemly without cause,
and to incur the imputation of madness; and who keep not their
proper rank. For nothing doth so build up as good order, as
peace, as love; even as their contraries tend to pull down. And
not only in things spiritual, but also in all others one may
observe this. Thus whether it be in a dance, or a ship, or in a
chariot, or a camp, if thou shouldest confound the order, and
casting the greater out of their proper place, shouldest bring in
the lesser into their rank, thou destroyest all, and thus things
are turned upside down. Neither let us then destroy our order,
nor place the head below and the feet above:  now this is done
when we cast down right reason, and set our lusts, passions, and
pleasure, over the rational part: whence violent are the billows,
and great the confusion, and intolerable the tempest, all things
being wrapt in darkness.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxviii-p25">And, if thou wilt, let us first examine the
unseemliness which arises herefrom, and then the loss. How then
may this be clear to us, and thoroughly known? Let us bring
forward a man in that frame of mind; enamoured of a harlot and
overcome by a dishonorable passion; and then we shall see the
mockery which this comes to. For what can be baser than a man
watching the doors before the harlots’ chambers, and beaten by a
whorish woman, and weeping, and lamenting, and turning his glory
into shame? And if thou wilt also see the loss, call to mind, I
pray, the expenditure of money, the extreme risks, the contests
with rival lovers, the wounds, the stripes received in such
affrays.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxviii-p26">Such also are they who are holden by the lust of
wealth; or rather they behave themselves more unseemly. For
whereas these are wholly occupied about one person; the covetous
busy themselves about all men’s substance alike, both poor and
rich, and long for things that are not; a thing which above all
denotes the wildness of their passion. For they say not, “I
would fain have the substance of such a person or of such
another,” only, but they want the very mountains to be gold, and
the houses and all that they see; and they go forth into another
world, and this passion they feel to a boundless degree, and at no
point cease from their lusting. What discourse can set before us
the tempest of those thoughts, the waves, the darkness? And where
the waves and tempest are so great, what pleasure can there be? 
There is not any; but tumult, and anguish, and black clouds which
instead of rain bring great sorrow of heart: the kind of thing
which is wont to happen in the case of those who are enamoured of
beauty not their own. Wherefore they who have no passionate love
at all are in more pleasure than any lovers.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxviii-p27">[5.] This however no man would gainsay. But to
me even he who loves, but restrains his passion, seems to live more
pleasurably than he who continually enjoys his mistress. For
though the proof be rather difficult, nevertheless even at that
disadvantage the argument must be ventured on: the cause of the
increased difficulty not being the nature of the thing, but because
of the want of meet hearers for this high morality. Thus: 
whether is it pleasanter, tell me, to the lover, to be despised by
his beloved, or to be honored, and to look down upon her? 
Evidently the latter. Whom then, tell me, will the harlot value
more? Him that is a slave to her and is already led captive at
her will, or him that is above her nets and soareth higher than her
arrows?  Every one must see, the latter. And about whom will she
take more thought, the fallen, or him that is not yet so? Him
that is not yet so, of course. And which will be more an object
of desire, he who is subdued, or he who is not yet taken? He who
up to this time is not yet taken. And if ye disbelieve it, I will
produce my proof from what takes place within yourselves. As
thus: of which woman would a man be more enamored; one that
easily submits and gives herself up to him, or one that denies, and
gives him trouble? Evidently of this last; since hereby the
longing is more vehemently kindled. Of course then in the
woman’s case also exactly the same thing will happen. And him
will they honor and admire more who looks down upon them. But if
this be true, so likewise is the other, that he enjoys greater
pleasure who is more honored and beloved. Since the general too
lets alone the city that hath been once taken, but that which
stands out and maintains the struggle he besets with all
diligence: and the hunter, when the animal is caught, keeps it
shut up in darkness as the harlot doth her lover, but pursues that
which flies from him.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxviii-p28">But I shall be told, “the one enjoys his desire,
the other not so.” But freedom from disgrace, and from being a
slave under her tyrannical commands, the not being led and dragged
about by her as a drudge, beaten, spit upon, pitched head foremost;
dost thou consider this to be a small pleasure, tell me? Nay, if
one would accurately examine these things, and were able to gather
into one their insults, complaints, everlasting quarrels, some
arising from their tempers, others from their wantonness, their
enmities, and all the rest, such as they only that feel them
know;—he will find that there is no war but hath more truces than
this wretched life of theirs. What pleasure then meanest thou,
tell me? The temporary and brief enjoyment of intercourse? But
this speedily doth strife overtake, and storms, and rage, and the
same madness again.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxviii-p29"><pb n="225" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_225.html" id="iv.xxxviii-Page_225" />[6.] And these
things have been said by us, as one would speak discoursing with
licentious youths, who do not very patiently submit to hear our
discourses of the kingdom and of hell.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxviii-p30">And now that we are bringing forward these topics
also, it is not even possible to say how great is the pleasure of
the continent; if one frame in one’s own mind his crowns, his
rewards, his converse with the angels, the proclaiming of him
before the world, his boldness, those blessed and immortal hopes of
his.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxviii-p31">“But intercourse hath a certain pleasure:” for
this they are continually repeating: “while the continent
continually suffers pain contending with the tyranny of
nature.” Nay, but one shall find just the contrary result.
For this violence and tumult is present with the unchaste rather: 
there being in his body a violent tempest, and no sea in a storm so
grievously vexed as he; never withstanding his passion, but ever
receiving blows from it; as the possessed and they that are
continually rent in the midst by evil spirits. Whereas the
temperate like a noble champion continually giving blows to it,
reaps the best of pleasures, and sweeter than ten thousand of that
kind; and this victory and his good conscience, and those
illustrous trophies, are ornaments for him continually to deck
himself withal.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxviii-p32">As to the other, if after his intercourse he hath a
little respite, it must be counted nothing. For again the storm
comes on, and again there are waves. But he that commands himself
doth not suffer this tumult to lay hold of him at all, nor the sea
to arise, nor the wild beast to roar. And even if he endure some
violence in restraining such an impulse, yet so doth the other
also, continually receiving blows and stabs, and unable to endure
the sting: and it is like as if there were a wild horse furious
and struggling, and one should check with the bridle, and hold him
in with all skill: while another giving him the rein to escape
the trouble, were dragged along by him and carried hither and
thither.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxviii-p33">If I have spoken these things more plainly than is
becoming, let no man blame me. For I desire not to make a brave
show by a gravity of words, but to make my hearers grave.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxviii-p34">Therefore also the prophets spare no such words,
wishing to extirpate the licentiousness of the Jews, but do even
more nakedly inveigh against them than we do now in the things we
have spoken. For so a physician wishing to remove an ulcer doth
not consider how he may keep his hands clean, but how he may rid
the patient of the ulcer; and he who would raise on high the lowly,
first makes himself lowly; and he who seeks to slay the conspirator
stains himself with blood as well as the other, and this makes him
the more brilliant. Since if one were to see a soldier returning
from the war, stained with gore and blood and brains, he will not
loathe him nor turn from him on this account, but will even admire
him the more. So then let us do, when we see any one returning,
covered with blood after the slaughter of his evil desire, let us
the more admire him and become partakers of his battle and victory,
and say to those who indulge this wild love, “show us the
pleasure you derive from lust; for the continent hath that which
comes of his victory, but thou none from any quarter. But if ye
should mention that which is connected with the criminal act, yet
the other is more manifest and satisfactory. For thou hast from
the enjoyment something brief and hardly apparent; but he from his
conscience, hath both a greater and an enduring and a sweeter
joy. The company of a woman hath surely no such power as
self-command, to preserve the soul undisturbed and give it
wings.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxviii-p35">Well then: the continent man, as I said, thus
evidently makes his pleasure out to us: but in thy case I see the
dejection arising from defeat, but the pleasure, desiring to see, I
find not. For what dost thou consider the moment of pleasure? 
That before the criminal action? Nay, it is not so, for it is a
time of madness and delirium and frenzy: to grind the teeth and
be beside one’s self is not any pleasure: and if it were
pleasure, it would not produce the same effects on you which they
who are in pain endure. For they who strike with their fists and
are stricken grind their teeth, and women in travail distracted
with pains do the same. So that this is no pleasure, but frenzy
rather, and confusion, and tumult. Shall we say then, the time
after the action? Nay, neither is this. For neither could we
say that a woman just delivered is in pleasure, but in release from
certain pains. But this is by no means pleasure, but weakness
rather and falling away: and there is a great difference between
these two. What then is the time of pleasure, tell me? There is
none. But if there be any, it is so brief as not even to be
apparent. At least, having zealously sought in a great many ways
to detect and apprehend it, we have not been able. But the time
of the chaste man’s pleasure is not such, rather it is wider and
evident to all. Or rather, all his life is in pleasure, his
conscience crowned, the waves laid, no disturbance from any quarter
arising within him.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxviii-p36">Since then this man’s life is more in pleasure,
while the life spent in love of pleasure is in dejection and
disquiets; let us flee from licentiousness, let us keep hold on
continence, that we may also obtain the good things to come,
through the grace and mercy, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p class="c24" id="iv.xxxix-p5"><span class="c18" id="iv.xxxix-p5.1">Having</span> finished the
discourse of spiritual gifts, he passes to that which is of all
most necessary, the subject of the resurrection. For in this too
they were greatly unsound. And as in men’s bodies, when the
fever lays actual hold of their solid parts, I mean the nerves and
the veins and the primary elements, the mischief becomes incurable
unless it receive much attention; just so at that time also it was
like to happen. Since to the very elements of godliness the
mischief was proceeding. Wherefore also Paul uses great
earnestness. For not of morals was his discourse henceforth nor
about one man’s being a fornicator, another covetous, and another
having his head covered; but about the very sum of all good
things. For touching the resurrection itself they were at
variance. Because this being all our hope, against this point did
the devil make a vehement stand, and at one time he was wholly
subverting it, at another his word was that it was “past
already;” which also Paul writing to Timothy called a gangrene, I
mean, this wicked doctrine, and those that brought it in he
branded, saying, “Of whom is Hymenœus and Philetus, who
concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is
past already, and overthrow the faith of some.” (<scripRef passage="2 Tim. ii. 17, 18" id="iv.xxxix-p5.2" parsed="|2Tim|2|17|2|18" osisRef="Bible:2Tim.2.17-2Tim.2.18">2 Tim. ii. 17, 18</scripRef>.) At one time then they said
thus, but at another that the body rises not again but the
purification of the soul is the resurrection.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxix-p6">But these things that wicked demon persuaded
them to say, not wishing to overturn the resurrection only, but
also to show that all the things done for our sakes are a fable.
For if they were persuaded that there is no resurrection of bodies,
he would have gradually persuaded them that neither was Christ
raised. And thereupon he would introduce also this in due course,
that He had not come nor had done what He did. For such is the
craft of the devil. Wherefore also Paul calls it “cunning
craftiness<note place="end" n="256" id="iv.xxxix-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxix-p7"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxxix-p7.1">μεθοδείαν</span>. <scripRef passage="Eph. iv. 14" id="iv.xxxix-p7.2" parsed="|Eph|4|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Eph.4.14">Eph. iv. 14</scripRef>.</p></note>,” because
he doth not straightway signify what he intends to effect, for fear
of being detected, but dressing himself up in a mask of one kind,
he fabricates arts of another kind: and like a crafty enemy
attacking a city with walls, he secretly undermines it from
below: so as thereby to be hardly guarded against and to succeed
in his endeavors. Therefore such snares on his part being
continually detected, and these his crafty ambushes hunted out by
this admirable and mighty man, he said, “For we are not ignorant
of his devices.” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. ii. 11" id="iv.xxxix-p7.3" parsed="|2Cor|2|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.2.11">2 Cor. ii. 11</scripRef>.) So also here he unfolds
his whole guile and points out all his stratagems, and whatsoever
he would fain effect, Paul puts before us, with much exactness
going over all. Yea, and therefore he put this head after the
rest, both because it was extremely necessary and because it
involves the whole of our condition.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxix-p8">And observe his consideration: how first having
secured his own, he then proceeds even beyond in his discourse, and
them that are without he doth abundantly reduce to silence. Now
he secures his own, not by reasonings, but by things which had
already happened and which themselves had received and believed to
have taken place: a thing which was most of all apt to shame
them, and capable of laying hold on them. Since if they were
unwilling to believe after this, it was no longer Paul but
themselves they would disbelieve: which thing was a censure on
those who had once for all received it and changed their minds.
For this cause then he begins also from hence, implying that he
needs no other witnesses to prove his speaking truth, but those
very persons who were deceived.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxix-p9">[2.] But that what I say may become clearer, we
must needs in what follows attend to the very words. What then
are these? “I make known unto you, brethren,” saith he,
“the gospel which I preached unto you.” Seest thou with what
modesty he commences? Seest thou how from the beginning he points
out that he is bringing in no new nor strange thing? For he who
“maketh known” that which was already known but afterwards had
fallen into oblivion, “maketh known” by recalling it into
memory.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxix-p10"><pb n="227" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_227.html" id="iv.xxxix-Page_227" />And when he
called them “brethren,” even from hence he laid the foundation
of no mean part of the proof of his assertions. For by no other
cause became we “brethren,” but by the dispensation of Christ
according to the flesh. And this is just the reason why he thus
called them, at the same time soothing and courting them, and
likewise reminding them of their innumerable blessings.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxix-p11">And what comes next again is demonstrative of the
same. What then is this? “The gospel.” For the sum of the
gospels hath its original hence, from God having become man and
having been crucified and having risen again. This gospel also
Gabriel preached to the Virgin, this also the prophets to the
world, this also the apostles all of them.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxix-p12">“Which I preached unto you, which also ye
received, wherein also ye stand. By which also ye are saved, in
what word I preached unto you; if ye hold it fast, except ye
believed in vain.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxix-p13">Seest thou how he calls themselves to be witnesses
of the things spoken? And he saith not, “which ye heard,”
but, “which ye received,” demanding it of them as a kind of
deposit, and showing that not in word only, but also by deeds and
signs and wonders they received it, and that they should hold it
safe.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxix-p14">Next, because he was speaking of the things long
past, he referred also to the present time, saying, “wherein also
ye stand,” taking the vantage ground of them that disavowal might
be out of their power, though they wished it never so much. And
this is why at the beginning he said not, “I teach you,” but,
‘I make known unto you’ what hath already been made
manifest.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxix-p15">And how saith he that they who were so tossed with
waves “stand?” He feigns ignorance to profit them; which also
he doth in the case of the Galatians, but not in like manner. For
inasmuch as he could not in that case affect ignorance, he frames
his address in another way, saying, “I have confidence toward you
in the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded.” (<scripRef passage="Gal. v. 10" id="iv.xxxix-p15.1" parsed="|Gal|5|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gal.5.10">Gal. v. 10</scripRef>.) He said not, “that ye
were none otherwise minded,” because their fault was acknowledged
and evident, but he answers for the future; and yet this too was
uncertain; but it was to draw them to him more effectually. Here
however he doth feign ignorance, saying, “wherein also ye
stand.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxix-p16">Then comes the advantage; “by which also ye are
saved, in what words I preached it unto you.” “So then, this
present exposition is for doctrine clearness and interpretation.
For the doctrine itself ye need not,” saith he, “to learn, but
to be reminded of it and corrected.” And these things he saith,
leaving them no room to plunge into recklessness once for all.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxix-p17">But what is, “in what word I preached it
unto you?” After what manner did I say,” saith he, “that
the resurrection takes place? For that there is a resurrection I
would not say that ye doubt: but ye seek perhaps to obtain a
clearer knowledge of that saying. This then will I provide for
you: for indeed I am well assured that ye hold the doctrine.”
Next, because he was directly affirming, “wherein also ye
stand;” that he might not thereby make them more remiss, he
alarms them again, saying, “If ye hold it fast, except ye
believed in vain;” intimating that the stroke is on the chief
head, and the contest for no common things but in behalf of the
whole of the faith. And for the present he saith it with reserve,
but as he goes on and waxes warm, he throws off the veil and
proceeds to cry out<note place="end" n="257" id="iv.xxxix-p17.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxix-p18"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxxix-p18.1">γυμνῇ λοιπὸν τῇ κεφαλῇ
βοᾷ</span>.</p></note>, and say, “But if Christ hath not
been raised then is our preaching vain, your faith also is vain: 
ye are yet in your sins:” but in the beginning not so: for
thus it was expedient to proceed, gently and by degrees.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxix-p19"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 15.3" id="iv.xxxix-p19.1" parsed="|1Cor|15|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.15.3">Ver. 3</scripRef>.
“For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also
received.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxix-p20">Neither here doth he say, “I said unto you,”
nor, “I taught you,” but uses the same expression again,
saying, “I delivered unto you that which also I received:”
nor again here doth he say, “I was taught,” but, “I
received:” establishing these two things; first, that one ought
to introduce nothing from one’s self; next, that by demonstration
from his deeds they were fully persuaded, not by bare words: and
by degrees while he is rendering his argument credible, he refers
the whole to Christ, and signifies that nothing was of man in these
doctrines.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxix-p21">But what is this, “For I delivered unto you
first of all?<note place="end" n="258" id="iv.xxxix-p21.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxix-p22"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxxix-p22.1">ἐν
πρώτοις</span>.</p></note>” for that
is his word. “In the beginning, not now.” And thus saying
he brings the time for a witness, and that it were the greatest
disgrace for those who had so long time been persuaded now to
change their minds: and not this only, but also that the doctrine
is necessary. Wherefore also it was “delivered” among “the
first,” and from the beginning straightway. And what didst thou
so deliver? tell me. But this he doth not say straightway, but
first, “I received.” And what didst thou receive? “That
Christ died for our sins.”  He said not immediately that there
is a resurrection of our bodies, yet this very thing in truth he
doth establish, but afar off and by other topics saying that
“Christ died,” and laying before a kind of strong base
and <pb n="228" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_228.html" id="iv.xxxix-Page_228" />irrefragable
foundation of the doctrine concerning the resurrection. For
neither did he simply say that “Christ died;” although even
this were sufficient to declare the resurrection, but with an
addition, “Christ died for our sins.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxix-p23">[3.] But first it is worth while to hear what
those who are infected with the Manichæan doctrines say here, who
are both enemies to the truth and war against their own
salvation. What then do these allege? By death here, they say,
Paul means nothing else than our being in sin; and by resurrection,
our being delivered from our sins. Seest thou how nothing is
weaker than error? And how it is taken by its own wings, and
needs not the warfare from without, but by itself it is pierced
through? Consider, for instance, these men, how they too have
pierced themselves through by their own statements. Since if this
be death, and Christ did not take a body, as ye suppose, and yet
died, He was in sin according to you. For I indeed say that He
took unto Himself a body and His death, I say, was that of the
flesh; but thou denying this, wilt be compelled to affirm the
other. But if He was in sin, how saith He, “Which of you
convinceth Me of sin?” and “The prince of this world cometh,
and hath nothing in me?” (<scripRef passage="John viii. 46; xiv. 30" id="iv.xxxix-p23.1" parsed="|John|8|46|0|0;|John|14|30|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.8.46 Bible:John.14.30">John viii. 46; xiv. 30</scripRef>.) and again, “Thus it
becometh Us to fulfill all righteousness?” (<scripRef passage="Matt. iii. 15" id="iv.xxxix-p23.2" parsed="|Matt|3|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.3.15">Matt. iii. 15</scripRef>.) Nay, how did He at all die
for sinners, if Himself were in sin? For he who dies for sinners
ought himself to be without sin. Since if he himself also sin,
how shall he die for other sinners? But if for others’ sins He
died, He died being without sin: and if being without sin He
died, He died—not the death of sin; for how could He being
without sin?—but the death of the body. Wherefore also Paul did
not simply say, “He died,” but added, “for our sins:”
both forcing these heretics against their will to the confession of
His bodily death, and signifying also by this that before death He
was without sin: for he that dies for others’ sins, it
followeth must himself be without sin.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxix-p24">Neither was he content with this, but added,
“according to the Scriptures:” hereby both again making his
argument credible, and intimating what kind of death he was
speaking of: since it is the death of the body which the
Scriptures everywhere proclaim. For, “they pierced My hands and
My feet,” (<scripRef passage="Ps. xxi. 18" id="iv.xxxix-p24.1" parsed="|Ps|21|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.21.18">Ps. xxi.

buried.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxix-p30">And this also confirms the former topics, for that
which is buried is doubtless a body. And here he no longer adds,
“according to the Scriptures.” He had wherewithal,
nevertheless he adds it not. For what cause? Either because the
burial was evident unto all, both then and now, or because the
expression, “according to the Scriptures,” is set down of both
in common. Wherefore then doth he add, “according to the
Scriptures,” in this place, “and that He rose on the third day
according to the Scriptures,” and is not content with the former
clause, so spoken in common? Because this also was to most men
obscure: wherefore here again he brings in “the Scriptures”
by inspiration, having so conceived this thought so wise and
divine.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxix-p31">How is it then that he doth the same in regard
of His death<note place="end" n="263" id="iv.xxxix-p31.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxix-p32"> The Benedictines insert a negative here, which
contradicts the sense, and is not in Savile.</p></note>? Because
in that case too, although the cross was evident unto all and in
the sight of all He was stretched upon it; yet the cause was no
longer equally so. The fact indeed of his death all knew, but
that He suffered this for the sins of the world was no longer
equally known to the multitude. Wherefore he brings in the
testimony from the Scriptures.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxix-p33">This however hath been sufficiently proved by what
we have said. But where have the Scrip<pb n="229" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_229.html" id="iv.xxxix-Page_229" />tures said that He was buried, and on
the third day shall rise again? By the type of Jonah which also
Himself alleges, saying, “As Jonah was three days and three

indeed, but was not holden of death continually<note place="end" n="264" id="iv.xxxix-p33.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxix-p34"> This sign is variously yet without
contradiction interpreted by the Fathers. St. Augustin considers

not consuming the thorny hardness of their heart. t. v. p. 25.
St. Cyril (<i>in Exod</i>. t. i. p. 263.) of the Divine Nature
inhabiting the Human, yet not consuming it, in the person of our
Lord. Theodoret (<i>in loc</i>.) says, “The power and mercy of
God are proclaimed by the circumstance, that the bush being mere
brushwood was not consumed by the unquenchable fire: I think
however that other intimations are conveyed by this circumstance: 
as that Israel, plotted against by the Egyptians, should not be
consumed, but overcome his enemies; and that the Only-Begotten,
being made incarnate and dwelling in the Virgin’s Womb, shall
keep that virginity inviolate.” Tertull. (<i>adv. Gnost</i>. c.
1.) alludes to it, as representing the Church in the fire of
persecution.</p></note>. And the dragon also in Daniel
shadows out this. For as the dragon having taken the food which
the prophet gave, burst asunder in the midst;<note place="end" n="265" id="iv.xxxix-p34.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxix-p35"> <scripRef passage="Bel and the Dragon, v. 27" id="iv.xxxix-p35.1">Bel and

that Body, was rent asunder, the Body of itself cutting asunder its
womb and rising again.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxix-p36">Now if thou desirest to hear also in words those
things which thou hast seen in types, listen to Isaiah, saying,
“His life is taken from the earth,” (<scripRef passage="Is. liii. 8, 10, 11" id="iv.xxxix-p36.1" parsed="|Isa|53|8|0|0;|Isa|53|10|0|0;|Isa|53|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.53.8 Bible:Isa.53.10 Bible:Isa.53.11">Is. liii. 8, 10, 11</scripRef>.)<note place="end" n="266" id="iv.xxxix-p36.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxix-p37"> LXX. in our vers. “it pleased the Lord to bruise

suffer Thy Holy One to see corruption.” (<scripRef passage="Ps. xvi. 10" id="iv.xxxix-p37.1" parsed="|Ps|16|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.16.10">Ps. xvi. 10</scripRef>.)</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxix-p38">Therefore Paul also sends thee on to the Scriptures,
that thou mayest learn that not without cause nor at random were
these things done. For how could they, when so many prophets are
describing and proclaiming them beforehand? And no where doth the
Scripture mean the death of sin, when it makes mention of our
Lord’s death, but that of the body, and a burial and resurrection
of the same kind.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxix-p39">[5.] <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 15.5" id="iv.xxxix-p39.1" parsed="|1Cor|15|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.15.5">Ver. 5</scripRef>. “And that He appeared to

“Then he appeared to James; then to all the Apostles.”</p>

“And last of all, as unto one born out of due time, he appeared
to me also.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxix-p43">Thus, since he had mentioned the proof from the
Scriptures, he adds also that by the events, producing as witnesses
of the resurrection, after the prophets, the apostles and other
faithful men. Whereas if he meant that other resurrection, the
deliverance from sin, it were idle for him to say, He appeared to
such and such an one; for this is the argument of one who is
establishing the resurrection of the body, not of one obscurely
teaching deliverance from sins. Wherefore neither said he once
for all, “He appeared,” although it were sufficient for him to
do so, setting down the expression in common: but now both twice
and thrice, and almost in each several case of them that had seen
Him he employs it. For “He appeared,” saith he, “to Cephas,
He appeared to above five hundred brethren, He appeared to me
also.” Yet surely the Gospel saith the contrary, that He was
seen of Mary first. (<scripRef passage="Mark xvi. 9" id="iv.xxxix-p43.1" parsed="|Mark|16|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Mark.16.9">Mark xvi. 9</scripRef>.) But among men He was seen
of him first who did most of all long to see Him.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxix-p44">But of what twelve apostles doth he here
speak<note place="end" n="267" id="iv.xxxix-p44.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxix-p45"> [It is generally considered that “the twelve”
is simply a designation of the Apostolic college. C.]</p></note>? For after
He was received up, Matthias was taken into the number, not after
the resurrection immediately. But it is likely that He appeared
even after He was received up. At any rate, this our apostle
himself after His ascension was both called, and saw Him.
Therefore neither doth he set down the time, but simply and without
defining recounts the appearance. For indeed it is probable that
many took place; wherefore also John said, “This third time He
was manifested.” (<scripRef passage="John xxi. 14" id="iv.xxxix-p45.1" parsed="|John|21|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.21.14">John xxi. 14</scripRef>.)</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxix-p46">“Then He appeared to above five hundred
brethren.” Some say that “above<note place="end" n="268" id="iv.xxxix-p46.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xxxix-p47"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxxix-p47.1">ἐ</span><span class="Greek" id="iv.xxxix-p47.2">πάνω</span>. [One wonders that Chrysostom should
mention this meaning of the word, yet it has been adopted by Peter
Martyr and Seinler. It is certainly far more natural to take it
as given in the A.V., especially as it is connected with a
numeral. Had the Apostle intended to express the meaning “from
above,” he would doubtless have used the word <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xxxix-p47.3"> ἄνωθεν</span>. C.]</p></note>,” is above from heaven; that is,
“not walking upon earth, but above and overhead He appeared to
them:” adding, that it was Paul’s purpose to confirm, not the
resurrection only, but also the ascension. Others say that the
expression, “above five hundred,” means, “more than five
hundred.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxix-p48">“Of whom the greater part remain until now.”
Thus, “though I relate events of old,” saith he, “yet have I
living witnesses.” “But some are fallen asleep.” He said
not, “are dead,” but, “are fallen asleep,” by this
expression also again confirming the resurrection. “After that,
He was seen of James.” I suppose, His brother. For the Lord
is said to have Himself ordained him and made him Bishop in
Jerusalem first. “Then to all the apostles.” For there were
also other apostles, as the seventy.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxix-p49">“And last of all he appeared unto me also, as unto
one born out of due time.” This is rather an expression of
modesty than any thing <pb n="230" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_230.html" id="iv.xxxix-Page_230" />else.
For not because he was the least, therefore did he appear to him
after the rest. Since even if He did call him last, yet he
appeared more illustrious than many which were before him, yea
rather than all. And the five hundred brethren too were not
surely better than James, because He appeared to them before
him.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxix-p50">Why did He not appear to all at the same time? 
That He might first sow the seeds of faith. For he that saw Him
first and was exactly and fully assured, told it unto the
residue: then their report coming first placed the hearer in
expectation of this great wonder, and made way before for the faith
of sight. Therefore neither did He appear to all together, nor in
the beginning to many, but to one alone first, and him the leader
of the whole company and the most faithful: since indeed there
was great need of a most faithful soul to be first to receive this
sight. For those who saw him after others had seen him, and heard
it from them, had in their testimony what contributed in no small
degree to their own faith and tended to prepare their mind
beforehand; but he who was first counted worthy to see Him, had
need, as I have said, of great faith, not to be confounded by a
sight so contrary to expectation. Therefore he appears to Peter
first. For he that first confessed Him to be Christ was justly
also counted worthy first to behold His resurrection. And not on
this account alone doth He appear to him first, but also because he
had denied Him, more abundantly to comfort him and to signify that
he is not despaired of, before the rest He vouchsafed him even this
sight and to him first entrusted His sheep. Therefore also He
appeared to the women first. Because this sex was made inferior,
therefore both in His birth and in His resurrection this first
tastes of His grace.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxix-p51">But after Peter, He appears also to each at
intervals, and at one time to fewer, at another to more, hereby
making them witnesses and teachers of each other, and rendering His
apostles trustworthy in all that they said.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxix-p52">[6.] “And last of all, as unto one born out of
due time, he appeared to me also.” What mean here his
expressions of humility, or wherein are they seasonable? For if
he wishes to show himself worthy of credit and to enrol himself
among the witnesses of the resurrection, he is doing the contrary
of what he wishes: since it were meet that he exalt himself and
show that he was great, which in many places he doth, the occasion
calling for it. Well, the very reason why he here also speaks
modestly is his being about to do this. Not straightway, however,
but with his own peculiar good sense: in that having first spoken
modestly and heaped up against himself many charges, he then
magnifies the things concerning himself. What may the reason
be? That, when he comes to utter that great and lofty expression
concerning himself, “I labored more abundantly than all,” his
discourse may be rendered more acceptable, both hereby, and by its
being spoken as a consequence of what went before and not as a
leading topic. Therefore also writing to Timothy, and intending
to say great things concerning himself, he first sets down his
charges against himself. For so all persons, when speaking in
high terms of others, speak out freely and with boldness: but he
that is compelled to praise himself, and especially when he also
calls himself to witness, is disconcerted and blushes. Therefore
also this blessed man first declares his own misery, and then
utters that lofty expression. This then he doth, partly to abate
the offensiveness of speaking about himself, and partly that he
might hereby recommend to their belief what he had to say
afterwards. For he that truly states what things are
discreditable to him and conceals none of them, such as that he
persecuted the Church, that he laid waste the faith, doth hereby
cause the things that are honorable to him also to be above
suspicion.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxix-p53">And consider the exceeding greatness of his
humility. For having said, “and last of all He appeared to me
also,” he was not content with this: “For many that are last
shall be first,” saith He, “and the first last.” (<scripRef passage="Matt. xx. 16" id="iv.xxxix-p53.1" parsed="|Matt|20|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.20.16">Matt. xx. 16</scripRef>.) Therefore he added, “as
unto one born out of due time.” Neither did he stop here, but
adds also his own judgment and with a reason, saying,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxix-p54"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 15.9" id="iv.xxxix-p54.1" parsed="|1Cor|15|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.15.9">Ver. 9</scripRef>.
“For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be
called an apostle, because I persecuted the Church of God.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxix-p55">And he said not, of the twelve alone, but also of
all the other apostles. And all these things he spake, both as
one speaking modestly and because he was really so disposed as I
said, making arrangements also beforehand for what was intended to
be spoken and rendering it more acceptable. For had he come
forward and said, “Ye ought to believe me that Christ rose from
the dead; for I saw Him and of all I am the most worthy of credit,
inasmuch as I have labored more,” the expression might have
offended the hearers: but now by first dwelling on the
humiliating topics and those which involve accusation, he both took
off what might be grating in such a narrative, and prepared the way
for their belief in his testimony.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxix-p56">On this account therefore neither doth he simply, as
I said, declare himself to be the last and unworthy of the
appellation of an apostle, but also states the reason, saying,
“because I persecuted the Church.” And yet all those things
were forgiven, but nevertheless he himself never forgot them,
desiring to signify the greatness of God’s favor: wherefore
also he goes on to say,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxix-p57"><pb n="231" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_231.html" id="iv.xxxix-Page_231" />[7.] <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 15.10" id="iv.xxxix-p57.1" parsed="|1Cor|15|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.15.10">Ver.

defects he imputes to himself, but of the good deeds nothing;
rather he refers all to God. Next, lest he might hereby render
his hearer supine, he saith, “And His grace which was bestowed
upon me was not found vain.” And this again with reserve: in
that he said not, “I have displayed a diligence worthy of His
grace,” but, “it was not found vain.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxix-p60">“But I labored more abundantly than they all.”
He said not, “I was honored,” but, “I labored;” and when he
had perils and deaths to speak of, by the name of labor he again
abates his expression.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxix-p61">Then again practicing his wonted humility, this also
he speedily passes by and refers the whole to God, saying, “Yet
not I, but the grace of God which was with me.” What can be
more admirable than such a soul? who having in so many ways
depressed himself and uttered but one lofty word, not even this
doth he call his own; on every side finding ways, both from the
former things and from them that follow after, to contract this
lofty expression, and that because it was of necessity that he came
to it.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxix-p62">But consider how he abounds in the expressions of
humility. For so, “to me last of all He appeared,” saith
he. Wherefore neither doth he with himself mention any other, and
saith, “as of one born out of due time,” and that himself is
“the least of the apostles,” and not even worthy of this
appellation. And he was not content even with these, but that he
might not seem in mere words to be humble-minded, he states both
reasons and proofs: of his being “one born out of due time,”
his seeing Jesus last; and of his being unworthy even of the name
of an apostle, “his persecuting the Church.” For he that is
simply humble-minded doeth not this: but he that also sets down
the reasons utters all from a contrite mind. Wherefore also he
elsewhere makes mention of these same things, saying, “And I
thank him that enabled me; even Christ Jesus our Lord, for that He
counted me faithful, appointing the to his service, though I was
before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious.” (<scripRef passage="1 Tim. i. 12, 13" id="iv.xxxix-p62.1" parsed="|1Tim|1|12|1|13" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.1.12-1Tim.1.13">1 Tim. i. 12, 13</scripRef>.)</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxix-p63">But wherefore did he utter at all that same lofty
expression, “I labored more abundantly than they?” He saw
that the occasion compelled him. For had he not said this, had he
only depreciated himself, how could he with boldness call himself
to witness, and number himself with the rest, and say,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxix-p64"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 15.11" id="iv.xxxix-p64.1" parsed="|1Cor|15|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.15.11">Ver. 11</scripRef>. “Whether then it be I or
they, so we preach.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxix-p65">For the witness ought to be trustworthy, and a great
man. But how he “labored more abundantly than they,” he
indicated above, saying, “Have we no right to eat and to drink,
as also the other Apostles?” And again, “to them that are
without law as without law.” Thus, both where exactness was to
be displayed, he overshot all: and where there was need to
condescend, he displayed again the same great superiority.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxix-p66">But some cite his being sent to the Gentiles and his
overrunning the larger part of the world. Whence it is evident
that he enjoyed more grace. For if he labored more, the grace was
also more: but he enjoyed more grace, because he displayed also
more diligence. Seest thou how by those particulars whereby he
contends and strives to throw into shade the things concerning
himself, he is shown to be first of all?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxix-p67">[8.] And these things when we hear, let us also
make open show of our defects, but of our excellencies let us say
nothing. Or if the opportunity force it upon us, let us speak of
them with reserve and impute the whole to God’s grace: which
accordingly the Apostle also doth, ever and anon putting a bad mark
upon his former life, but his after-state imputing to grace, that
he might signify the mercy of God from every circumstance: from
His having saved him such as he was and when saved making him again
such as he is. Let none accordingly of those who are in sin
despair, let none of those in virtue be confident, but let the one
be exceeding fearful and the other forward. For neither shall any
slothful man be able to abide in virtue, nor one that is diligent
be weak to escape from evil. And of both these the blessed David
is an example, who after he slumbered a little, had a great
downfall: and when he was pricked in his heart, again hastened up
to his former height. Since in fact both are alike evils, both
despair and slothfulness; the one quickly casting a man down from
the very arch of the heavens; the other not suffering the fallen to
rise again. Wherefore with respect to the one, Paul said, “Let
him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall:” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. x. 12" id="iv.xxxix-p67.1" parsed="|1Cor|10|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.10.12">1 Cor. x. 12</scripRef>.) but unto the other,
“To-day if ye will hear His voice, harden not your hearts: 
(<scripRef passage="Heb. iv. 7" id="iv.xxxix-p67.2" parsed="|Heb|4|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Heb.4.7">Heb. iv. 7</scripRef>.) and again, “Lift up the
hands that hang down and the palsied knees.” (<scripRef passage="Heb. xii. 12" id="iv.xxxix-p67.3" parsed="|Heb|12|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Heb.12.12">Heb. xii. 12</scripRef>.) And him too that had
committed fornication but repented, he therefore quickly refreshes,
“that such an one might not be swallowed up with his overmuch
sorrow?” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. ii. 7" id="iv.xxxix-p67.4" parsed="|2Cor|2|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.2.7">2 Cor. ii.
7</scripRef>.)</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxix-p68">Why then in regard of other griefs art thou cast
down, O man? Since if for sins, where only grief is beneficial,
excess works much mischief, much more for all other things. For
wherefore grievest thou? That thou hast lost money? Nay, think
of those that are not even 
<pb n="232" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_232.html" id="iv.xxxix-Page_232" />filled with bread, and thou shalt very speedily
obtain consolation. And in each of the things that are grievous
to thee mourn not the things that have happened, but for the
disasters that have not happened give thanks. Hadst thou money
and didst thou lose it? Weep not for the loss, but give thanks
for the time when thou didst enjoy it. Say like Job, “Have we
received good at the hand of the Lord, and shall we not receive
evil?” (<scripRef passage="Job ii. 10" id="iv.xxxix-p68.1" parsed="|Job|2|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Job.2.10">Job ii.
10</scripRef>.) And together with
that use this argument also; that even if thou didst lose thy
money, yet thy body thou hast still sound and hast not with thy
poverty to grieve that it also is maimed. But hath thy body too
endured some outrage? Yet is not this the bottom of human
calamities, but in the middle of the cask thou art as yet carried
along. For many along with poverty and maiming, both wrestle with
a demon and wander in deserts: others again endure other things
more grievous than these. For may it never be our lot to suffer
all that it is possible for one to bear.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxix-p69">These things then ever considering, bear in mind
them that suffer worse, and be vexed at none of those things: but
when thou sinnest, only then sigh, then weep; I forbid thee not,
nay I enjoin thee rather; though even then with moderation,
remembering that there is returning, there is reconciliation. But
seest thou others in luxury and thyself in poverty: and another
in goodly robes, and in preeminence? Look not however on these
things alone, but also on the miseries that arise out of these.
And in thy poverty too, consider not the beggary alone, but the
pleasure also thence arising do thou take into account. For
wealth hath indeed a cheerful mask, but its inward parts are full
of gloom; and poverty the reverse. And shouldest thou unfold each
man’s conscience, in the soul of the poor thou wilt see great
security and freedom: but in that of the rich, confusions,
disorders, tempests. And if thou grievest, seeing him rich, he
too is vexed much more than thou when he beholds one richer than
himself. And as thou fearest him, even so doth he another, and he
hath no advantage over thee in this. But thou art vexed to see
him in office, because thou art in a private station and one of the
governed. Recollect however the day of his ceasing to hold
office. And even before that day the tumults, the perils, the
fatigues, the flatteries, the sleepless nights, and all the
miseries.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxix-p70">[9.] And these things we say to those who have no
mind for high morality: since if thou knowest this, there are
other and greater things whereby we may comfort thee: but for the
present we must use the coarser topics to argue with thee. When
therefore thou seest one that is rich, think of him that is richer
than he, and thou wilt see him in the same condition with
thyself. And after him look also on him that is poorer than
thyself, consider how many have gone to bed hungry, and have lost
their patrimony, and live in a dungeon, and pray for death every
day. For neither doth poverty breed sadness, nor wealth pleasure,
but both the one and the other our own thoughts are wont to produce
in us. And consider, beginning from beneath: the scavenger
grieves and is vexed that he cannot be rid of this his business so
wretched and esteemed so disgraceful: but if thou rid him of
this, and cause him, with security, to have plenty of the
necessaries of life, he will grieve again that he hath not more
than he wants: and if thou grant him more, he will wish to double
them again, and will therefore vex himself no less than before: 
and if thou grant him twofold or threefold, he will be out of heart
again because he hath no part in the state: and if you provide
him with this also, he will count himself wretched because he is
not one of the highest officers of state. And when he hath
obtained this honor, he will mourn that he is not a ruler; and when
he shall be ruler, that it is not of a whole nation; and when of a
whole nation, that it is not of many nations; and when of many
nations, that it is not of all. When he becomes a deputy, he will
vex himself again that he is not a king; and if a king, that he is
not so alone; and if alone, that he is not also of barbarous
nations; and if of barbarous nations, that he is not of the whole
world even: and if of the whole world, why not likewise of
another world? And so his course of thought going on without end
does not suffer him ever to be pleased. Seest thou, how even if
from being mean and poor thou shouldest make a man a king, thou
dost not remove his dejection, without first correcting his turn of
thought, enamored as it is of having more?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxix-p71">Come, let me show thee the contrary too, that even
if from a higher station thou shouldest bring down to a lower one
him that hath consideration, thou wilt not cast him into dejection
and grief. And if thou wilt, let us descend the same ladder, and
do thou bring down the satrap from his throne and in supposition
deprive him of that dignity. I say that he will not on this
account vex himself, if he choose to bear in mind the things of
which I have spoken. For he will not reckon up the things of
which he hath been deprived, but what he hath still, the glory
arising from his office. But if thou take away this also, he will
reckon up them who are in private stations and have never ascended
to such sway, and for consolation his riches will suffice him.
And if thou also cast him out again from this, he will look to them
that have a moderate estate. And if thou shouldest take <pb n="233" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_233.html" id="iv.xxxix-Page_233" />away even moderate wealth, and
shouldest allow him to partake only of necessary food, he may think
upon them that have not even this, but wrestle with incessant
hunger and live in prison. And even if thou shouldest bring him
into that prison-house, when he reflects on them that lie under
incurable diseases and irremediable pains, he will see himself to
be in much better circumstances. And as the scavenger before
mentioned not even on being made a king will reap any cheerfulness,
so neither will this man ever vex himself if he become a
prisoner. It is not then wealth that is the foundation of
pleasure, nor poverty of sadness, but our own judgment, and the
fact, that the eyes of our mind are not pure, nor are fixed
anywhere and abide, but without limit flutter abroad. And as
healthy bodies, if they be nourished with bread alone, are in good
and vigorous condition: but those that are sickly, even if they
enjoy a plentiful and varied diet, become so much the weaker; so
also it is wont to happen in regard of the soul. The mean
spirited, not even in a diadem and unspeakable honors can be
happy: but the denying, even in bonds and fetters and poverty,
will enjoy a pure pleasure.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxix-p72">[10.] These things then bearing in mind, let us
ever look to them that are beneath us. There is indeed, I grant,
another consolation, but of a high strain in morality, and mounting
above the grossness of the multitude. What is this? That wealth
is naught, poverty is naught, disgrace is naught, honor is naught,
but for a brief time and only in words do they differ from each
other. And along with this there is another soothing topic also,
greater than it; the consideration of the things to come, both evil
and good, the things which are really evil and really good, and the
being comforted by them. But since many, as I said, stand aloof
from these doctrines, therefore were we compelled to dwell on other
topics, that in course we might lead on to them the receivers of
what had been said before.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xxxix-p73">Let us then, taking all these things into account,
by every means frame ourselves aright, and we shall never grieve at
these unexpected things. For neither if we should see men rich in
a picture, should we say they were to be envied, any more than on
seeing poor men there depicted we should call them wretched and
pitiable: although those are surely more abiding than they whom
we reckon wealthy. Since one abides rich in the picture longer
than in the nature itself of things. For the one often lasts,
appearing such, even to a hundred years, but the other sometimes,
not having had so much as a year to live at his ease in his
possessions, hath been suddenly stripped of all. Meditating then
on all these things, let us from all quarters build up cheerfulness
as an outwork against our irrational sorrow, that we may both pass
the present life with pleasure, and obtain the good things to come,
through the grace and mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ, with Whom to
the Father, with the Holy Ghost, be glory, power, honor, now and
forever, and world without end. Amen.</p>

Apostles and abased himself, then again having exalted himself
above them that he might make out an equality: (for he did effect
an equality, when he showed that he had advantages over them as
well as they over him,) and having thereby proved himself worthy of
credit; neither so doth he dismiss them, but again ranks himself
with them, pointing out their concord in Christ. Nevertheless he
doth it not so as that he should seem to have been tacked on to
them,<note place="end" n="270" id="iv.xl-p4.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xl-p5"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xl-p5.1">προσεῤῥίφθαι</span>.</p></note> but as
himself also to appear in the same rank. For so it was profitable
for the Gospel. Wherefore also he was equally earnest, on the one
hand, that he might not seem to overlook them; on the other, that
he might not be on account of the honor paid to them held cheap by
those that were under his authority. Therefore he also now makes
himself equal again, saying,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p6">“Whether then it be I or they, so we preach.”
“From whomsoever,” saith he, “ye choose to learn, learn;
there is no difference between us.” And he said not, “if ye
will not believe me, believe them;” but while he makes himself
worthy of credit and saith that he is of himself sufficient, he
affirms the same also of them by themselves. For the difference
of persons took no effect, their authority being equal. And in
the Epistle to the Galatians <pb n="234" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_234.html" id="iv.xl-Page_234" />he
doth this, taking them with him, not as also standing in need of
them, but saying indeed that even himself was sufficient: “For
they who were of repute imparted nothing to me:” (<scripRef passage="Gal. ii. 6" id="iv.xl-p6.1" parsed="|Gal|2|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gal.2.6">Gal. ii. 6</scripRef>.) nevertheless, even so I
follow after agreement with them. “For they gave unto me,”
saith he, “their right hands.” (<scripRef passage="Gal. ii. 9" id="iv.xl-p6.2" parsed="|Gal|2|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gal.2.9">Gal. ii. 9</scripRef>.) For if the credit of Paul
were always to depend on others and to be confirmed by testimony
from others, the disciples would hence have received infinite
injury. It is not therefore to exalt himself that he doeth this,
but fearing for the Gospel. Wherefore also he here saith, making
himself equal, “Whether it be I or they, so we preach.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p7">Well did he say, “we preach,” indicating
his great boldness of speech. For we speak not secretly, nor<note place="end" n="271" id="iv.xl-p7.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xl-p8"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xl-p8.1">ἐν

but we utter a voice clearer than a trumpet. And he said not,
“we preached,” but, “even now ‘so we preach.’” “And
so ye believed.” Here he said not, “ye believe,” but, “ye
believed.” Because they were shaken in mind, therefore he ran
back to the former times, and proceeds to add the witness from
themselves.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p9">[2.] <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 15.12" id="iv.xl-p9.1" parsed="|1Cor|15|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.15.12">Ver. 12</scripRef>. “Now if Christ is
preached that He hath been raised from the dead, how say some among
you that there is no resurrection of the dead?”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p10">Seest thou how excellently he reasons, and proves
the resurrection from the fact of Christ’s being raised, having
first established the former in many ways? “For both the
prophets spake of it,” saith he, “and the Lord Himself showed
it by His appearing, and we preach, and ye believed;” weaving
thus his fourfold testimony; the witness of the prophets, the
witness of the issue of events, the witness of the apostles, the
witness of the disciples; or rather a fivefold. For this very
cause too itself implies the resurrection; viz. his dying for
others’ sins. If therefore this hath been proved, it is evident
that the other also follows, viz. that the other dead likewise are
raised. And this is why, as concerning an admitted fact, he
challenges and questions them, saying, “Now if Christ hath been
raised, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the
dead?”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p11">Hereby also again abating the boldness of the
gainsayers: in that he said not, “how say, ye,” but, “how
say some among you.” And neither doth he bring a charge against
all nor declare openly the very persons whom he accuses, in order
not to make them more reckless: neither on the other hand doth he
conceal it wholly, that he may correct them. For this purpose
accordingly, separating them from the multitude, he strips himself
for the contest with them, by this both weakening and confounding
them, and holding the rest in their conflicts with these firmer to
the truth, nor suffering them to desert to those that were busy to
destroy them: he being in fact prepared to adopt a vehement mode
of speech.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p12">Further, lest they should say, “this indeed is
clear and evident unto all that Christ is raised, and none doubts
it; this doth not however necessarily imply the other also, to wit,
the resurrection of mankind:”—for the one was both before
proclaimed and came to pass, and was testified of by his appearing;
the fact, namely, of Christ’s resurrection: but the other is
yet in hope, i.e., our own part:—see what he doeth; from the
other side again he makes it out: which is a proof of great
power. Thus, “why do some say,” saith he, “that there is no
resurrection of the dead?” Of course then the former also in
its turn is subverted by this, the fact, namely, that Christ is
raised. Wherefore also he adds, saying,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p13"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 15.13" id="iv.xl-p13.1" parsed="|1Cor|15|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.15.13">Ver. 13</scripRef>. “But if there is no
resurrection of the dead, neither hath Christ been raised.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p14">Seest thou Paul’s energy, and his spirit for the
combat, so invincible? how not only from what is evident he
demonstrates what is doubted, but also from what is doubted,
endeavors to demonstrate to gainsayers the former evident
proposition? Not because what had already taken place required
demonstration, but that he might signify this to be equally worthy
of belief with that.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p15">[3.] “And what kind of consequence is this?”
saith one. “For if Christ be not raised, that then neither
should others be raised, doth follow: but that if others be not
raised, neither should Christ be raised, what reason can there be
in this?” Since then this doth not appear to be very
reasonable, see how he works it out wisely, scattering his seeds
beforehand from the beginning, even from the very groundwork of the
Gospel: as, that “having died for our sins,” He was raised;
and that He is “the first-fruits of them that slept.” For the
first-fruits—of what can He be the first-fruits, except of them
that are raised? And how can He be first-fruits, if they rise not
of whom He is first-fruits? How then are they not raised?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p16">Again, if they be not raised, wherefore was Christ
raised? Wherefore came He? Wherefore did He take upon Him
flesh, if he were not about to raise flesh again? For He stood
not in need of it Himself but for our sakes. But these things he
afterwards set down as he goes on; for the present he saith, “If
the dead be not raised, neither hath Christ been raised,” as
<pb n="235" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_235.html" id="iv.xl-Page_235" />though that were connected with
this. For had He not intended to raise Himself, He would not have
wrought that other work. Seest thou by degrees the whole economy
overthrown by those words of theirs and by their unbelief in the
resurrection? But as yet he saith nothing of the incarnation, but
of the resurrection. For not His having become incarnate, but His
having died, took away death; since while He had flesh, the tyranny
of death still had dominion.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p17"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 15.14" id="iv.xl-p17.1" parsed="|1Cor|15|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.15.14">Ver. 14</scripRef>. “And if Christ hath not
been raised, then is our preaching vain, your faith also is
vain.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p18">Although what followed in due course would have
been, “but if Christ be not risen, ye fight against things
evident, and against so many prophets, and the truth of facts;”
nevertheless he states what is much more fearful to them: “then
is our preaching vain, your faith also is vain.” For he wishes
to shake thoroughly their mind: “we have lost all,” saith he,
“all is over, if He be not risen.” Seest thou how great is
the mystery of the œconomy? As thus: if after death He could
not rise again, neither is sin loosed nor death taken away nor the
curse removed. Yea, and not only have we preached in vain, but ye
also have believed in vain.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p19">[4.] And not hereby alone doth he show the impiety
of these evil doctrines, but he further contends earnestly against
them, saying,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p20"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 15.15" id="iv.xl-p20.1" parsed="|1Cor|15|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.15.15">Ver. 15</scripRef>. “Yea, and we are found
false witnesses of God: because we witnessed of Him that He
raised up Christ; whom He raised not up, if so be that the dead are
not raised.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p21">But if this be absurd, (for it is a charge against
God and a calumny,) and He raised Him not, as ye say, not only
this, but other absurdities too will follow.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p22">And again he establishes it all, and takes it up
again, saying,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p23"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 15.16" id="iv.xl-p23.1" parsed="|1Cor|15|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.15.16">Ver. 16</scripRef>. “For if the dead are not
raised, neither hath Christ been raised.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p24">For had He not intended to do this, He would not
have come into the world. And he names not this, but the end, to
wit, His resurrection; through it drawing all things.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p25"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 15.17" id="iv.xl-p25.1" parsed="|1Cor|15|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.15.17">Ver. 17</scripRef>. “And if Christ hath not
been raised, your faith is vain.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p26">With whatever is clear and confessed, he keeps on
surrounding the resurrection of Christ, by means of the stronger
point making even that which seems to be weak and doubtful, strong
and clear.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p27">“Ye are yet in your sins.” For if He was not
raised, neither did He die; and if He died not, neither did He take
away sin: His death being the taking away of sin. “For
behold,” saith one, “the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin
of the world.” (<scripRef passage="John i. 29" id="iv.xl-p27.1" parsed="|John|1|29|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.1.29">John
i. 29</scripRef>.) But how
“taketh away?” By His death. Wherefore also he called him a
Lamb, as one slain. But if He rose not again, neither was He
slain: and if He was not slain, neither was sin taken away: and
if it was not taken away, ye are in it: and if ye are in it, we
have preached in vain: and if we have preached in vain, ye have
believed in vain that ye were reconciled. And besides, death
remains immortal, if He did not arise. For if He too was holden
of death and loosed not its pains, how released He all others,
being as yet Himself holden of it? Wherefore also he adds,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p28"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 15.18" id="iv.xl-p28.1" parsed="|1Cor|15|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.15.18">Ver. 18</scripRef>. “Then they also which are
fallen asleep in Christ have perished.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p29">“And why speak I of you,” saith he,
“when all those also are perished, who have done all and are no
longer subject to the uncertainty of the future?” But by the
expression, “in Christ,” he means either “in the faith,” or
“they who died for His sake, who endured many perils, many

that by the resurrection here means the liberation from sin<note place="end" n="273" id="iv.xl-p31.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xl-p32"> The Manichæans say, “that Christ came in
the last times, to deliver not bodies but souls.” St. Aug. <i>
de Hæres</i>. §. 46. They argued against the resurrection of
the body from such texts as 
<scripRef passage="1 Cor. v. 5; xv. 50" id="iv.xl-p32.1" parsed="|1Cor|5|5|0|0;|1Cor|15|50|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.5.5 Bible:1Cor.15.50">1 Cor. v. 5; xv. 50</scripRef>; see Epiph. <i>
Hæres</i>. 66. §. 86, 87. They as well as the old Gnostics, of
course, took this line, holding as they did the inherent corruption
of matter.</p></note>? For these
compact and continuous syllogisms, holding as they do also
conversely, indicate nothing of what they say, but what we
affirm. It is true, “rising again” is spoken of one who has
fallen: and this is why he keeps on explaining, and saith not
only that He was raised, but adds this also, “from the dead.”
And the Corinthians too doubted not of the forgiveness of sins, but
of the resurrection of bodies.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p33">But what necessity is there at all, that
except mankind be not without sin, neither should Christ Himself be
so? Whereas, if He were not to raise men up, it were natural to
say, “wherefore came He and took our flesh and rose again?”
But on our supposition not so. Yea, and whether men sin or do not
sin, there is ever with God an impossibility of sinning, and what
happens to us reaches not to Him, nor doth one case answer to the
other by way of conversion, as in the matter of the resurrection of
the body<note place="end" n="274" id="iv.xl-p33.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xl-p34"> His argument may be thus briefly stated. The
Apostle had in the former verses made use of the resurrection of
Christ and our resurrection as terms implying one another. If
(according to the Manichees) the word resurrection means only
liberation from sin, the terms no longer imply one another. For
Christ by His divine nature cannot sin. It doth not therefore
follow that, if we be not raised, Christ is not risen.</p></note>.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p35">[4.] <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 15.19" id="iv.xl-p35.1" parsed="|1Cor|15|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.15.19">Ver. 19</scripRef>. “If in this life only we
have hoped in Christ, we are of all men most pitiable.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p36">What sayest thou, O Paul? How “in this <pb n="236" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_236.html" id="iv.xl-Page_236" />life only have we hope,” if our
bodies be not raised, the soul abiding and being immortal? 
Because even if the soul abide, even if it be infinitely immortal,
as indeed it is, without the flesh it shall not receive those
hidden good things, as neither truly shall it be punished. For
all things shall be made manifest before the judgment-seat of
Christ, “that every one may receive the things done in the body,
according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.”
(<scripRef passage="2 Cor. v. 10" id="iv.xl-p36.1" parsed="|2Cor|5|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.5.10">2 Cor. v. 10</scripRef>.) Therefore he saith, “if
in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most
pitiable.” For if the body rise not again, the soul abides
uncrowned without that blessedness which is in heaven. And if
this be so, we shall enjoy nothing then at all: and if nothing
then, in the present life is our recompense. “What then in this
respect can be more wretched than we?” saith he.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p37">But these things he said, as well to confirm them in
the doctrine of the resurrection of the body, as to persuade them
concerning that immortal life, in order that they might not suppose
that all our concerns end with the present world. For having
sufficiently established what he purposed by the former arguments,
and having said, “if the dead are not raised, neither hath Christ
been raised; but if Christ were not raised, we have perished, and
we are yet in our sins;” again he also subjoins this, thoroughly
demolishing their arrogance. For so when he intends to introduce
any of the necessary doctrines, he first shakes thoroughly their
hardness of heart by fear: which accordingly he did here, having
both above scattered those seeds, and made them anxious, as those
who had fallen from all: and now again after another manner, and
so as they should most severely feel it, doing this same thing and
saying, “‘we are of all men most pitiable,’ if after so great
conflicts and deaths and those innumerable evils, we are to fall
from so great blessings, and our happiness is limited by the
present life.” For in fact all depends on the resurrection.
So that even hence it is evident that his discourse was not of a
resurrection from sins, but of bodies, and of the life present and
to come.</p>

raised from the dead, the first-fruits of them that are
asleep.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p39">Having signified how great mischiefs are bred
from not believing the resurrection, he takes up the discourse
again, and says, “But now hath Christ been raised from the
dead;” continually adding, “from the dead,” so as to stop<note place="end" n="275" id="iv.xl-p39.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xl-p40"> lit. sew up, <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xl-p40.1">ἀ</span><span class="Greek" id="iv.xl-p40.2">πόῤῥαψαι</span>.</p></note> the mouths
of the heretics. “The first-fruits of them that slept.” But
if their first-fruits, then themselves also, must needs rise
again. Whereas if he were speaking of the resurrection from sins,
and none is without sin;—for even Paul saith, “I know nothing
against myself, yet am I not hereby justified<note place="end" n="276" id="iv.xl-p40.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xl-p41"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xl-p41.1">οὐδεν ἐμαυτῷ

rise again, according to you? Seest thou that his discourse was
of bodies? And that he might make it worthy of credit, he
continually brings forward Christ who rose again in the
flesh.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p42">Next he also assigns a reason. For, as I said,
when one asserts but does not state the reason, his discourse is
not easily received by the multitude. What then is the
reason?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p43"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 15.21" id="iv.xl-p43.1" parsed="|1Cor|15|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.15.21">Ver. 21</scripRef>. “For since by man came
death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p44">But if by a man, doubtless by one having a body.
And observe his thoughtfulness, how on another ground also he makes
his argument inevitable. As thus: “he that is defeated,”
saith he, “must in his own person also renew the conflict, the
nature which was cast down must itself also gain the victory. For
so the reproach was wiped away.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p45">But let us see what kind of death he is speaking
of.</p>

found that the term <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xl-p48.2">νεκροὶ</span> used in those
texts, is applied rather to each person’s actual sin and its
effects, than to the general result of Adam’s transgression; and
that <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xl-p48.3">ἀποθανὼν</span>,
when applied to the latter, relates to the death of the body: as

by St. Aug. <i>de Nupt</i>. ii. 46.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p49">[Whatever may be thought of the
speaker’s view of the former part of this verse, it is clear that
he does not make the “all” of the second clause coextensive
with the “all” of the first. He expressly excludes sinners.
And he is right. Men are connected with Adam by nature, but with
Christ by faith and this is the work of grace. Adam and Christ
are the two heads of humanity but in a different way. The
limitation of the second “all” is further confirmed by the fact
that the whole discussion here is about believers. The Apostle
says nothing in this chapter about the resurrection of
unbelievers. C.]</p></note>? How then
was Noah righteous in his generation? and how Abraham? and how Job?
and how all the rest? And what, I pray? shall all be made alive
in Christ? Where then are those who are led away into hell

but if of righteousness and sin, it doth so no longer.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p50">Further, lest, on hearing that the making alive is
common to all, thou shouldest also suppose that sinners are saved,

with enemies<note place="end" n="278" id="iv.xl-p56.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xl-p57"> The partisans of Marcellus of Ancyra, who
about the middle of the fourth century taught that the Personal
Kingdom of the Son, and indeed His Personality, will cease at the
last day, He being such an emanation from the Father as shall be
again absorbed into the Father. See S. Cyril, <i>Catech</i>. xv.
27. and others quoted by Bp. Pearson on the Creed, Art. vi. part
2. This error is supposed to have occasioned the insertion at
Constantinople of the words, “Of whose kingdom there shall be no
end,” in the Nicene Creed. It appears that Marcellus alleged
this text.</p></note>: wherefore
we first must practice the <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> which also
Paul often doeth. Since in this way shall we find what they say
most easy of detection. Let us ask them then first, what is the
meaning of the saying, “When he shall have delivered up the
kingdom to God, even the Father?” For if we take this just as
it stands and not in a sense becoming Deity, He will not after this
retain it. For he that hath delivered up to another, ceases any
longer to retain a thing himself. And not only will there be this
absurdity, but that also the other person who receives it will be
found not to be possessor of it before he hath so received it.
Therefore according to them, neither was the Father a King before,
governing our affairs: nor will it seem that the Son after these
things will be a King. How then, first of all, concerning the
Father doth the Son Himself say, “My Father worketh hitherto, and
I work:” (<scripRef passage="John v. 17" id="iv.xl-p57.1" parsed="|John|5|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.5.17">John
v. 17</scripRef>.) and of Him
Daniel, “That His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, which shall
not pass away?” (<scripRef passage="Dan. vii. 14" id="iv.xl-p57.2" parsed="|Dan|7|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Dan.7.14">Dan.
vii. 14</scripRef>.) Seest thou
how many absurdities are produced, and repugnant to the Scriptures,
when one takes the thing spoken after the manner of men?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p58">But what “rule,” then doth he here say, that
Christ “putteth down?” That of the angels? Far from it.
That of the faithful? Neither is it this. What rule then? 
That of the devils, concerning which he saith, “Our wrestling is
not against flesh and blood, but against the principalities,
against the powers, against the world-rulers of this darkness:”
(<scripRef passage="Eph. vi. 12" id="iv.xl-p58.1" parsed="|Eph|6|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Eph.6.12">Eph. vi. 12</scripRef>.) For now it is not as yet
“put down” perfectly, they working in many places, but then
shall they cease.</p>

He hath put all enemies under His feet.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p60">Again from hence also another absurdity is produced,
unless we take this also in a way becoming Deity. For the
expression “until,” is one of end and limitation: but in
reference to God, this does not exist.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p61"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 15.26" id="iv.xl-p61.1" parsed="|1Cor|15|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.15.26">Ver. 26</scripRef>. “The last enemy that
shall be abolished is death.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p62">How the last? After all, after the devil, after
all the other things. For so in the beginning also death came in
last; the counsel of the devil having come first, and our
disobedience, and then death. Virtually then indeed it is even
now abolished: but actually, at that time.</p>

been subjected unto Him, then shall the Son also Himself be
subjected unto Him that did subject all things unto Him.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p65">And yet before he said not that it was the Father
who “put things under Him,” but He Himself who
“abolishes.” For “when He shall have abolished,” saith
he, “all rule and authority:” and again, “for He must reign
until He hath put all His enemies under His feet.” How then
doth he here say, “the Father?”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p66">And not only is there this apparent perplexity, but
also that he is afraid with a very unaccountable fear, and uses a
correction, saying, “He is excepted, who did subject all things
unto Him,” as though some would suspect, whether the Father might
Himself not be subject unto the Son; than which what can be more
irrational? nevertheless, he fears this.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p67">How then is it? for in truth there are many
questions following one upon another. Well, give me then your
earnest attention; since in fact it is necessary for us first to
speak of the scope of Paul and his mind, which one may find
everywhere shining forth, and then to subjoin our solution: this
being itself an ingredient in our solution.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p68">What then is Paul’s mind, and what is his
custom? He speaks in one way when he discourses of the Godhead
alone, and in another when he falls into the argument of the
economy. Thus having once taken hold of our Lord’s Flesh, he
freely thereafter uses all the sayings that humiliate Him; without
fear as though that were able to bear all such expressions. Let
us see therefore here also, whether his discourse is of the simple
Godhead, or whether in view of the incarnation he asserts of Him
those things which he saith: or rather let us first point out
where he did this of which I have spoken. Where then did he
this? Writ<pb n="238" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_238.html" id="iv.xl-Page_238" />ing to the
Philippians he saith, “Who, being in the form of God, counted it
not a prize to be on an equality with God, but emptied Himself of
no reputation, taking the form of a servant, being made in the
likeness of men: and being found in fashion as a man, He humbled
Himself, becoming obedient even unto death, yea, the death of the
cross. Wherefore hath God highly exalted Him.” (<scripRef passage="Philip. ii. 6-9" id="iv.xl-p68.1" parsed="|Phil|2|6|2|9" osisRef="Bible:Phil.2.6-Phil.2.9">Philip. ii. 6–9</scripRef>.)</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p69">Seest thou how when he was discoursing of the
Godhead alone, he uttered those great things, that He “was in the
form of God” and that He “was equal with” Him that begat Him,
and to Him refers the whole? But when He showed Him to thee made
flesh, he lowered again the discourse. For except thou
distinguish these things, there is great variance between the
things spoken. Since, if He were “equal with God,” how did He
highly exalt one equal with Himself? If He were “in the form of
God,” how “gave” He Him “a name?” for he that giveth,
giveth to one that hath not, and he that exalteth, exalteth one
that is before abased. He will be found then to be imperfect and
in need, before He hath received the “exaltation” and “the
Name;” and many other absurd corollaries will hence follow. But
if thou shouldest add the incarnation, thou wilt not err in saying
these things. These things then here also consider, and with this
mind receive thou the expressions.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p70">[8.] Now together with these we will state
also other reasons why this pericope of Scripture was thus
composed. But at present it is necessary to mention this: 
first, that Paul’s discourse was of the resurrection, a thing
counted to be impossible and greatly disbelieved: next, he was
writing to Corinthians among whom there were many philosophers who
mocked at such things always. For although in other things
wrangling one with another, in this they all, as with one mouth,
conspired, dogmatically declaring that there is no resurrection.
Contending therefore for such a subject so disbelieved and
ridiculed, both on account of the prejudice which had been formed,
and on account of the difficulty of the thing; and wishing to
demonstrate its possibility, he first effects this from the
resurrection of Christ. And having proved it both from the
prophets, and from those who had seen, and from those who
believed: when he had obtained an admitted <i>reductio ad
absurdum</i>, he proves in what follows the resurrection of mankind
also. “For if the dead rise not,” saith he, “neither has
Christ been raised.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p71">Further; having closely urged these converse
arguments in the former verses, he tries it again in another way,
calling Him the “first-fruits,” and pointing to His
“abolishing all rule and authority and power, and death
last.” “How then should death be put down,” saith he,
“unless he first loose the bodies which he held?” Since then
he had spoken great things of the Only-Begotten, that He “gives
up the kingdom,” i.e., that He Himself brings these things to
pass, and Himself is victor in the war, and “putteth all things
under His feet,” he adds, to correct the unbelief of the
multitude, “for He must reign till He hath put all His enemies
under His feet.” Not as putting an end to the kingdom, did he
use the expression “until,” but to render what was said worthy
of credit, and induce them to be confident. For “do not,”
saith he, “because thou hast heard that He will abolish all rule,
and authority and power,” to wit, the devil, and the bands of
demons, (many as there are,) and the multitudes of unbelievers, and
the tyranny of death, and all evils: do not thou fear as though
His strength was exhausted. For until He shall have done all
these things, “He must reign;” not saying this, that after He
hath brought it to pass He doth not reign; but establishing this
other, that even if it be not now, undoubtedly it will be. For
His kingdom is not cut off: yea, He rules and prevails and abides
until He shall have set to right all things.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p72">And this manner of speech one might find also in the
Old Testament; as when it is said, “But the word of the Lord
abideth for ever;” (<scripRef passage="Ps. cxix. 89" id="iv.xl-p72.1" parsed="|Ps|119|89|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.119.89">Ps.
cxix. 89</scripRef>.) and, “Thou
art the same, and Thy years shall not fail.” (<scripRef passage="Ps. cii. 27" id="iv.xl-p72.2" parsed="|Ps|102|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.102.27">Ps. cii. 27</scripRef>.) Now these and such-like
things the Prophet saith, when he is telling of things which a long
space of time must achieve and which must by all means come to
pass; casting out the fearfulness of the duller sort of
hearers.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p73">But that the expression, “until,” spoken of God,
and “unto,” do not signify an end, hear what one saith: 
“From everlasting unto everlasting Thou art God:” (<scripRef passage="Ps. xc. 2" id="iv.xl-p73.1" parsed="|Ps|90|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.90.2">Ps. xc. 2</scripRef>.) and again, “I am, I am,”
and “Even to your old age I am He.” (<scripRef passage="Is. xlvi. 4" id="iv.xl-p73.2" parsed="|Isa|46|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.46.4">Is. xlvi. 4</scripRef>.)</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p74">For this cause indeed doth he set death last, that
from the victory over the rest this also might be easily admitted
by the unbeliever. For when He destroys the devil who brought in
death, much more will He put an end to His work.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p75">[9.] Since then he referred all to Him, the
“abolishing rule and authority,” the perfecting of His kingdom,
(I mean the salvation of the faithful, the peace of the world, the
taking away of evils, for this is to perfect His kingdom,) the
putting an end to death; and he said not, “the Father by Him,”
but, “Himself shall put down, and Himself shall put under His
feet,” and he no where mentioned Him that begat Him; he was
afraid afterward, lest on this account among 
<pb n="239" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_239.html" id="iv.xl-Page_239" />some of the more irrational persons, either
the Son might seem to be greater than the Father, or to be a
certain distinct principle, unbegotten.<note place="end" n="279" id="iv.xl-p75.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xl-p76"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xl-p76.1">ἀρχἠ
ἀγέννητος</span>.</p></note>  And therefore, gently guarding
himself, he qualifies the magnitude of his expressions, saying,
“for He put all things in subjection under His feet,” again
referring to the Father these high achievements; not as though the
Son were without power. For how could He be, of whom he testified
so great things before, and referred to Him all that was said? 
But it was for the reason which I mentioned, and that he might show
all things to be common to Father and Son which were done in our
behalf. For that Himself alone was sufficient to “put all
things in subjection under Him,” hear again Paul saying,
(<scripRef passage="Philip. iii. 21" id="iv.xl-p76.2" parsed="|Phil|3|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Phil.3.21">Philip. iii.
21</scripRef>.) “Who shall fashion
anew the body of our humiliation that it may be conformed to the
body of His glory, according to the working whereby He is able even
to subject all things unto Himself.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p77">Then also he uses a correction, saying, “But when
He saith, all things are put in subjection, it is evident that He
is excepted who did subject all things unto Him,” testifying even
thence no small glory to the Only-Begotten. For if He were less
and much inferior, this fear would never have been entertained by
him. Neither is he content with this, but also adds another
thing, as follows. I say, lest any should doubtingly ask, “And
what if the Father hath not been ‘put under Him?’ this doth not
at all hinder the Son from being the more mighty;” fearing this
impious supposition, because that expression was not sufficient to
point out this also, he added, going very much beyond it, “But
when all things have been subjected unto Him, then shall the Son
also Himself be subjected;” showing His great concord with the
Father, and that He is the principle of all other good things and
the first Cause, who hath begotten One so great in power and in
achievements.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p78">[10.] But if he said more than the subject-matter
demanded, marvel not. For in imitation of his Master he doeth
this: since He too purposing to show His concord with Him that
begat Him, and that He hath not come without His mind, descends so
far, I say not, as the proof of concord demanded, but as the
weakness of the persons present required. For He prays to His
Father for no other cause but this; and stating the reason He
saith, “that they may believe that Thou hast sent Me.” (<scripRef passage="John xi. 42" id="iv.xl-p78.1" parsed="|John|11|42|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.11.42">John xi. 42</scripRef>.) In imitation
therefore of Him, Paul here in his manner of speech goes beyond
what was required; not that thou mightest have any suspicion of a
forced servitude, far from it; but that he might the more entirely
cast out those impious doctrines. For so when he is minded to
pull up any thing by the roots, he is wont to do it, and abundantly
more with it<note place="end" n="280" id="iv.xl-p78.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xl-p79"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xl-p79.1">πολλῃ κέχρηται τῃ
περιουσίᾳ</span>.</p></note>. Thus too,
for example, when he spake of a believing wife and an unbelieving
husband, companying with one another by the law of marriage, that
the wife might not consider herself defiled by that intercourse and
the embraces of the unbeliever, he said not, “the wife is not
unclean,” nor, “she is no wise harmed by the unbeliever,”
but, which was much more, “the unbeliever is even
‘sanctified’ by her,” not meaning to signify that the heathen
was made holy through her, but by the very great strength of the
expression anxious to remove her fear.  So also here, his zeal to
take away that impious doctrine by a very strong utterance was the
cause of his expressing himself as he did. For as to suspect the
Son of weakness is extreme impiety: (wherefore he corrects it,
saying, “He shall put all enemies under His feet:”)  so on the
other hand is it more impious to consider the Father inferior to
Him. Wherefore he takes it also away with exceeding force. And
observe how he puts it. For he said not simply, “He is excepted
which put all things under Him,” but, “it is manifest,”
“for even if it be admitted,” saith he, “nevertheless I make
it sure<note place="end" n="281" id="iv.xl-p79.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xl-p80"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xl-p80.1">ἀ</span><span class="Greek" id="iv.xl-p80.2">σφαλίζομαι</span>.</p></note>.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p81">And that thou mayest learn that this is the reason
of the things spoken, I would ask thee this question: Doth an
additional “subjection” at that time befal the Son? And how
can this be other than impious and unworthy of God? For the
greatest subjection and obedience is this, that He who is God took
the form of a servant. How then will He be “subjected?”
Seest thou, that to take away the impious notion, he used this
expression? and this too in a suitable though reserved sense? For
he becomes a Son and a divine Person, so He obeys; not humanly, but
as one acting freely and having all authority. Otherwise how is
he co-enthroned? How, “as the Father raiseth up, even so He,
whom He will?” (<scripRef passage="John v. 21" id="iv.xl-p81.1" parsed="|John|5|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.5.21">John

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p83">[11.] But what is this, “When He shall

kingdoms of God, the one by appropriation<note place="end" n="283" id="iv.xl-p83.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xl-p84"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xl-p84.1">οἰκείωσιν</span>.</p></note>, the other by creation<note place="end" n="284" id="iv.xl-p84.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xl-p85"> This distinction, in these terms, is found

is King over all, both Greeks and Jews and devils and His
adversaries, in respect of His 
<pb n="240" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_240.html" id="iv.xl-Page_240" />creation: but He is King of the faithful and
willing and subject, in respect of His making them His own. This
is the kingdom which is said also to have a beginning. For
concerning this He saith also in the second Psalm, “Ask of Me,
and I shall give Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance.”
(<scripRef passage="Ps. ii. 8" id="iv.xl-p85.3" parsed="|Ps|2|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.2.8">Ps. ii. 8</scripRef>.) Touching
this also, He Himself said to His disciples, “All authority hath
been given unto Me by My father,” (<scripRef passage="Matt. xxviii. 18" id="iv.xl-p85.4" parsed="|Matt|28|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.28.18">Matt. xxviii. 18</scripRef>.) referring all to Him that
begat Him, not as though of Himself He were not sufficient, but to
signify that He is a Son, and not unbegotten. This kingdom then
He doth “deliver up,” i.e., “bring to a right end.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p86">“What then,” saith one, “can be the
reason why He spake nothing of the Spirit?” Because of Him he
was not discoursing now, nor doth he confound all things
together. Since also where he saith, “There is one God the
Father, and one Lord Jesus,” undoubtedly not as allowing the
Spirit to be inferior, is he therefore silent, but because for the
time it was not urgent, he so expressed himself. For he is wont
also to make mention of the Father only, yet we must not therefore
cast out the Son: he is wont to speak also of the Son and of the
Spirit only, yet not for this are we to deny<note place="end" n="285" id="iv.xl-p86.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xl-p87"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xl-p87.1">ἀ</span><span class="Greek" id="iv.xl-p87.2">θετήσομεν</span>.</p></note> the Father.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p88">But what is, “that God may be all in all?”
That all things may be dependent upon Him, that none may suppose
two authorities without a beginning, nor another kingdom separated
off; that nothing may exist independent of him. For when the
enemies shall be lying under the feet of the Son, and He having
them cast under His feet be at no variance with His Father, but at
concord with Him in entire perfection, then He shall Himself “be
all in all.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p89">But some say that he spake this to declare the
removal of wickedness, as though all would yield thenceforth and
none would resist nor do iniquity. For when there is no sin, it
is evident that “God shall be all in all.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p90">[12.] But if bodies do not rise again, how are
these things true? For the worst enemy of all, death, remains,
having wrought whatever he listed. “Nay,” saith one, “for
they shall sin no more.” And what of that? For he is not
discoursing here of the death of the soul, but of that of the
body? How then is he “put down?” For victory is this, the
winning of those things which have been carried off and detained.
But if men’s bodies are to be detained in the earth, it follows
that the tyranny of death remains, these bodies for their part
being holden, and there being no other body for him to be
vanquished in. But if this which Paul spake of, ensue, as
undoubtedly it will ensue, God’s victory will appear, and that a
glorious one, in His being able to raise again the bodies which
were holden thereby. Since an enemy too is then vanquished, when
a man takes the spoils, not when he suffers them to remain in the
other’s possession: but unless one venture to take what is his,
how can we say that he is vanquished? After this manner of
victory doth Christ Himself say in the Gospels that He hath been
victorious, thus speaking, “When he shall bind the strong man,
then shall he also spoil his goods.” (<scripRef passage="Matt. xii. 29" id="iv.xl-p90.1" parsed="|Matt|12|29|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.12.29">Matt. xii. 29</scripRef>.) Since if this were not so,
it would not be at all a manifest victory. For as in the death of
the soul, “he that hath died is justified from sin;” (<scripRef passage="Rom. vi. 7" id="iv.xl-p90.2" parsed="|Rom|6|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.6.7">Rom. vi. 7</scripRef>.) (and yet we cannot say that
this is a victory, for he is not the victor who adds no more to his
wickedness, but he who hath done away the former captivity of his
passions;) just so in this instance also, I should not call
death’s being stayed from feeding on the bodies of men a splendid
victory, but rather that the bodies heretofore holden by him should
be snatched away from him.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p91">But if they should still be contentious and should
say that these things were spoken of the soul’s death, how is
this “destroyed last?” since in the case of each one at his
Baptism it hath been destroyed perfectly. If however thou
speakest of the body, the expression is admissible; I mean, such a
saying as that it will be “last destroyed.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p92">But if any should doubt why discoursing of the
resurrection, he did not bring forward the bodies which rose again
in the time of our Lord, our answer might be the following: that
this could not be alleged in behalf of the resurrection. For to
point out those who after rising died again, suited not one
employed in proving that death is entirely destroyed. Yea, this
is the very reason why he said that he is “destroyed last,”
that thou mightest never more suspect his rising again. For when
sin is taken away, much more shall death cease: it being out of
all reason when the fountain is dried up, that the stream flowing
from it should still subsist; and when the root is annihilated,
that the fruit should remain.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p93">[13.] Since then in the last day the enemies of
God shall be destroyed, together with death and the devil and the
evil spirits, let us not be dejected at the prosperity of the
enemies of God. For the enemies of the Lord in the moment of
their glory and exaltation fail; “yea, like smoke have they
failed away.” (<scripRef passage="Ps. xxxvii. 20" id="iv.xl-p93.1" parsed="|Ps|37|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.37.20">Ps.
xxxvii. 20</scripRef>.) When thou
seest any enemy of God wealthy, with armed attendants and many
flatterers, be not cast down, but lament, weep, call upon God, that
He may enrol him amongst His friends: and the more he prospers
being God’s enemy, <pb n="241" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_241.html" id="iv.xl-Page_241" />so much
the more do thou mourn for him. For sinners we ought always to
bewail, but especially when they enjoy wealth and abundance of good
days; even as one should the sick, when they eat and drink to
excess.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p94">But there are some, who when they hear these words
are of so unhappy a disposition, as to sigh bitterly thereupon, and
say, “Tears are due to me who have nothing.” Thou hast well
said, “who have nothing,” not because thou hast not what
another hath, but because thou accountest the thing such as to be
called happy; yea, for this cause art thou worthy of infinite
lamentations: even as, if a person living in health should count
happy him that is sick and lying on a soft couch, this latter is
not near so wretched and miserable as he, because he hath no sense
of his own advantages. Just such a result one may observe in
these men’s case also: nay, and hereby our whole life is
confounded and disordered. For these sayings have undone many,
and betrayed them to the devil, and made them more pitiable than
such as are wasted with famine. Yea, that those who long after
more, are more wretched than mendicants, as being possessed with a
greater and bitterer sorrow than they, is evident from what
follows.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p95">A drought once overtook our city, and all were
trembling for the last of evils, and were beseeching God to rid
them of this fear. And one might see then that which was spoken
of by Moses; (<scripRef passage="Deut. xxviii. 23" id="iv.xl-p95.1" parsed="|Deut|28|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Deut.28.23">Deut.

heavens become brass,” and a death, of all deaths the most
horrible, waited for every day. But afterwards, when it seemed
good to the merciful God, beyond all expectation there was wafted
down from heaven a great and plentiful rain, and thenceforth all
were in holiday and feasting, as having come up from the very gates
of death. But in the midst of so great blessings and the common
gladness of all, one of those exceedingly wealthy people went about
with a gloomy and downcast countenance, quite dead with sorrow; and
when many enquired the reason, wherefore in the common joy of all
men he alone is sorrowful, he could not even keep within him his
savage passion, but goaded by the tyranny of the disease, declared
before them all the reason. “Why,” saith he, “having in my
possession ten thousand measures of wheat, I have no means of
disposing of them left.” Shall we then count him happy, tell
me, for these words, for which he deserved to be stoned? Him that
was more cruel than any wild beast, the common enemy? What sayest
thou, man? Art thou sad because all did not perish, that thou
mightest gather gold? Hast thou not heard what Solomon saith,
(<scripRef passage="Prov. xi. 26" id="iv.xl-p95.2" parsed="|Prov|11|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Prov.11.26">Prov. xi. 26</scripRef>.) “He that

people shall curse him?” but goest about a common enemy of the
blessings of the world, and a foe to the liberality of the Lord of
the world, and a friend of Mammon, or rather his slave? Nay, doth
not that tongue deserve to be cut out, and the heart to be
quenched, that brought forth these words?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p97">[14.] Seest thou how gold doth not suffer men to
be men, but wild beasts and fiends? For what can be more pitiful
than this rich man, whose daily prayer is that there may be famine,
in order that he may have a little gold? Yea, and his passion by
this time is come round to the contrary of itself: he not even
rejoicing in his abundant store of the fruits of the earth, but on
this very account grieving the rather, (to such a pass is he come,)
that his possessions are infinite. Although one who hath much
ought to be joyful: but this man on that very account is
dejected. Seest thou that, as I said, the rich do not reap as
much pleasure from what is present, as they endure sorrow for what
hath not yet been added? For he that had innumerable quantities
of wheat did more grieve and lament than he who suffered hunger.
And while the one, on merely having his necessary food, was
crowning himself and leaping for joy and giving thanks to God; the
other, who had so much, was fretting and thought he was undone.
It is not then the superfluity which causes our pleasure, but a
self-controlling mind: since without this, though one obtain and
have all, he will feel as one deprived of all and will mourn
accordingly:  inasmuch as this man too of whom we are now
speaking, even if he had sold all he had for as large a sum as he
wished, would again have grieved that it was not for more; and if
he could have had more, he would again have sought another advance;
and if he had disposed of the bushel for one pound, he would even
then have been distracted for sorrow, that the half bushel could
not be sold for as much. And if the price were not set so high at
first, marvel not. Since drunkards also are not at first
inflamed, but when they have loaded themselves with much wine, then
they kindle the flame into greater fierceness: so these men, by
how much more they have grasped, in so much the greater poverty do
they find themselves, and they who gain more than others, are the
very persons to be the most in want.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p98">[15.] But I say these things not only to this man,
but also to each one of those who are so diseased: those, I say,
who raise the price of their wares and make a traffic of the
poverty of their neighbors. For of humanity none any where makes
account: but every where the covetous desire brings out many at
the time of sale. And oil and wine is sold by one quicker, by
another more slowly, but neither out of regard 
<pb n="242" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_242.html" id="iv.xl-Page_242" />to others; rather the one seeks gain, the other
to avoid loss by the spoiling of his produce. Thus, because most
men not making much account of the laws of God, shut up and keep
all in doors, God by other means leading them to humanity,—that
were it but of necessity they may do something kind,—hath infused
into them the fear of greater loss, not allowing the fruits of the
earth to keep any long time, in order that out of mere dread of the
damage from their spoiling, they may expose for sale to the needy,
even against their will, such things as they wickedly bury at home
and keep. However, after all this, some are so insatiable as not
even thereby to be corrected. Many, for example, have gone so far
as to empty whole casks, not giving even a cup-full to the poor
man, nor a piece of money to the needy, but after it hath become
vinegar, they dash it all upon the ground, and destroy their casks
together with the fruit. Others again who would not give a part
of a single cake to the hungry, have thrown whole granaries into
some river: and because they listened not to God who bade them
give to the needy, at the bidding of the moth, even unwillingly,
they emptied out all they had in their houses, in utter destruction
and waste; drawing down upon their own heads together with this
loss much scorn and many a curse.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p99">And such is the course of their affairs here; but
the hereafter, what words shall set before us? For as these men
in this world cast their moth-eaten grain, become useless, into
rivers; even so the doers of such things, on this very account
become useless, God casts into the river of fire. Because as the
grain by the moth and worm, so are their souls devoured by cruelty
and inhumanity. And the reason of these things is their being
nailed to things present, and gaping after this life only. Whence
also such men are full of infinite sadness; for name whatever
pleasure thou wilt, the fear of their end is enough to annihilate
all, and such an one “is dead, while he is yet alive.” (<scripRef passage="1 Tim. v. 6" id="iv.xl-p99.1" parsed="|1Tim|5|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.5.6">1 Tim. v. 6</scripRef>.)</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p100">Now then that unbelievers should have these
feelings, is no marvel; but when they who have partaken of so great
mysteries and learned such high rules of self-denial concerning
things to come, delight to dwell in things present, what indulgence
do they deserve?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p101">[16.] Whence then arises their loving to dwell in
present things? From giving their mind to luxury, and fattening
their flesh, and making their soul delicate, and rendering their
burden heavy, and their darkness great, and their veil thick. For
in luxury the better part is enslaved, but the worse prevails; and
the former is blinded on every side and dragged on in its maimed
condition; while the other draws and leads men about every where,
though it ought to be in the rank of things that are led.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p102">Since great indeed is the bond between the
soul and the body; the Maker having contrived this, lest any should
induce us to abhor it as alien. For God indeed bade us love our
enemies; but the devil hath so far prevailed as to induce some<note place="end" n="287" id="iv.xl-p102.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xl-p103"> The Manichæans, and Gnostic sects.</p></note> even to hate
their own body. Since when a man saith that it is of the devil,
he proves nothing else than this; which is the extreme of dotage.
For if it be of the devil, what is this so perfect harmony, such as
to render it meet in every way for the energies of the
self-controlling soul? “Nay,” saith one, “if it be meet,
how doth the body blind it?” It is not the body which blinds
the soul; far from it, O man; but the luxury. But whence do we
desire the luxury? Not from our having a body, by no means; but
from an evil choice. For the body requires feeding, not high
feeding<note place="end" n="288" id="iv.xl-p103.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xl-p104"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xl-p104.1">τροφῆς οὐ τρυφῆς</span>.</p></note>, the body
needs nourishing, not breaking up and falling apart. You see that
not to the soul only, but to the very body also which receives the
nourishment, the luxury is hostile. For it becomes weaker instead
of strong, and softer instead of firm, and sickly instead of
healthful, and heavier instead of light, and slighter instead of
compact, and ill-favored instead of handsome, and unsavory instead
of fragrant, and impure instead of clean, and full of pain instead
of being at ease, and useless instead of useful, and old instead of
young, and decaying instead of strong, and slow and dull instead of
quick, and maimed instead of whole. Whereas if it were of the
devil, it ought not to receive injury from the things of the devil,
I mean, from sin.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p105">[17.] But neither is the body, nor food, of
the devil, but luxury alone. For by means of it that malignant
fiend brings to pass his innumerable evils. Thus did he make

the beginning of those thunderbolts on Sodom. And to declare
this, Ezekiel said, “But this was the iniquity of Sodom, in pride

should this be? Because as a sepulchre she bears about her body,

will the soul be affected; what disorder, what <pb n="243" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_243.html" id="iv.xl-Page_243" />waves, what a tempest will she be
filled with? Hereby, you see, she becomes unfitted for every
duty, and will have no power easily to speak, or hear, or take
counsel, or do anything that is needful. But as a pilot when the
storm hath got the better of his skill, is plunged into the deep,
vessels and sailors and all: so also the soul together with the
body is drowned in the grievous abyss of insensibility.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p110">For, in fact, God hath set the stomach in our bodies
as a kind of mill, giving it a proportionate power, and appointing
a set measure which it ought to grind every day. If therefore one
cast in more, remaining undigested it doth injury to the whole
body. Hence diseases and weaknesses and deformities: since in
truth luxury makes the beautiful woman not only sickly, but also
foul to look upon. For when she is continually sending forth
unpleasant exhalations, and breathes fumes of stale wine, and is
more florid than she ought to be, and spoils the symmetry that
beseems a woman, and loses all her seemliness, and her body becomes
flabby, her eyelids bloodshot and distended, and her bulk unduly
great, and her flesh an useless load; consider what a disgust it
all produces.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p111">Moreover, I have heard a physician say that many

digestion of such things, that which ought to serve for growth is
spent on this digestion of superfluities. Why need one speak of
gout, rheum dispersed every where, the other diseases hence
arising, the whole abomination? For nothing is so disgusting as a
woman pampering herself with much food. Therefore among the
poorer women one may see more of beauty: the superfluities being
consumed and not cleaving to them, like some superfluous clay, of
no use and benefit. For their daily exercise, and labors, and
hardships, and their frugal table, and spare diet, minister unto
them much soundness of body, and thence also much bloom.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p112">[18.] But if thou talkest of the pleasure of
luxury, thou wilt find it to go no farther than the throat: since
as soon as it hath passed the tongue, it is flown away, leaving
behind in the body much that is disgusting. For do not I pray
look on the voluptuaries at table only, but when you see them rise
up, then follow them, and you will see bodies rather of wild beasts
and irrational creatures than of human beings. You will see them
with headache, distended, bound up, needing a bed and a couch and
plenty of rest, and like men who are tossed in a great tempest and
require others to save them, and long for that condition in which
they were before they were swelled even to bursting<note place="end" n="293" id="iv.xl-p112.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xl-p113"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xl-p113.1">πρὶν ἢ

carrying their bellies about with a burden like that of women with
child, and can scarce step forward, and scarce see, and scarce
speak, and scarce do any thing. But if it should chance that they
sleep a little, they see again strange dreams and full of all
manner of fancies.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p114">What should one say of that other madness of theirs?
the madness of lust, I mean, for this also hath its fountains from
hence. Yea, as horses wild after the female, so they, goaded on
by the sting of their drunkenness, leap upon all, more irrational
than they, and more frantic in their boundings; and committing many
more unseemlinesses which but to name is unlawful. For they know
not in fact any longer what they suffer, nor what they do.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xl-p115">But not so he that keeps from luxury: rather he
sits in harbor, beholding other men’s shipwrecks, and enjoys a
pleasure pure and lasting, following after that life which becomes
him that is free. Knowing therefore these things, let us flee
from the evil banquets of luxury and cleave to a spare table; that
being of a good habit both of soul and body, we may both practice
all virtue, and attain the good things to come, through the grace
and mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ, with Whom to the Father, with
the Holy Ghost, be glory, power, and honor, now and ever, and world
without end. Amen.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xli-p8">[The author justly derides this
custom and the endeavor to explain the passage as a reference to
it. Yet not a few of the soundest expositors hold that the
Apostle was referring to the practice of vicarious baptism, not
that he approved of it but as an argument <i>ex concessu</i>. See
the vindication of it in Hodge (<i>in lo</i>). To the same effect
DeWette, Meyer, Stanley, Alford, Heinrici, Beet, and the Principal
Edwards. On the other hand Canon Evans (<i>in Bible
Commentary</i>) contends strenuously for the interpretation of the
Greek Fathers, Theophylact, Theodoret, etc., and heartily approves
of Chrysostom’s scornful repudiation of the monstrous
superstition. He insists that vicarious baptism in its legitimate
issues must lead to something like salvation by proxy. Then he
asks, “Now if such a superstition, even in the germ, had appeared
in Corinth before the date of this epistle, would not Paul have
come down upon it with all his thunder? Would he not have devoted
a whole chapter to its extinction?” To me there seems but one
answer to these questions. If so, then the Apostle could not
referred to the practice, even in the way of an <i>argumentum ad
hominem</i>. C.]</p></note>. So great power hath the devil
over the souls of careless sinners. Then being called to account,
they allege this expression, saying that even the Apostle hath
said, “They who are baptized for the dead.” Seest thou their
extreme ridiculousness? Is it meet then to answer these things? 
I trow not; unless it were necessary to discourse with madmen of
what they in their frenzy utter. But that none of the more
exceedingly simple folk may be led captive, one must needs submit
to answer even these men. As thus, if this was Paul’s meaning
wherefore did God threaten him that is not baptized? For it is
impossible that any should not be baptized henceforth, this being
once devised: and besides, the fault no longer lies with the
dead, but with the living. But to whom spake he, “Unless ye eat
My flesh, and drink My blood, ye have no life in yourselves?”

compelling us either not to speak clearly or to declare unto them
the ineffable mysteries. Nevertheless, as I may be able, I will

<p class="c19" id="iv.xli-p15">As thus: after the enunciation of those mystical
and fearful words, and the awful rules of the doctrines which have
come down from heaven, this also we add at the end when we are
about to baptize, bidding them say, “I believe in the
resurrection of the dead,” and upon 
<pb n="245" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_245.html" id="iv.xli-Page_245" />this faith we are baptized. For after we
have confessed this together with the rest, then at last are we let
down into the fountain of those sacred streams. This therefore
Paul recalling to their minds said, “if there be no resurrection,
why art thou then baptized for the dead<note place="end" n="301" id="iv.xli-p15.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xli-p16"> See before, Hom. 23. §. 3.</p></note>?” i.e., the dead bodies. For in

dead<note place="end" n="302" id="iv.xli-p16.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xli-p17"> i.e., the very act of immersion and emersion
affirms the spiritual death and resurrection of thine own body.
cf. <scripRef passage="Rom. vi. 3-5" id="iv.xli-p17.1" parsed="|Rom|6|3|6|5" osisRef="Bible:Rom.6.3-Rom.6.5">Rom. vi. 3–5</scripRef>. as quoted below, and the

believing that it no longer remains dead. And thou indeed in the
words makest mention of a resurrection of the dead; but the priest,
as in a kind of image, signifies to thee by very deed the things
which thou hast believed and confessed in words. When without a
sign thou believest, then he gives thee the sign also; when thou
hast done thine own part, then also doth God fully assure thee.
How and in what manner? By the water. For the being baptized
and immersed and then emerging, is a symbol of the descent into
Hades and return thence. Wherefore also Paul calls baptism a
burial, saying, “Therefore we are buried with Him by baptism into
death.” (<scripRef passage="Rom. vi. 4" id="iv.xli-p17.2" parsed="|Rom|6|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.6.4">Rom.
vi. 4</scripRef>.) By this he
makes that also which is to come credible, I mean, the resurrection
of our bodies. For the blotting out sins is a much greater thing
than the raising up of a body. And this Christ declaring, said,
“For whether is easier to say, Thy sins are forgiven, or to say,
Take up thy bed, and walk?” (<scripRef passage="Matt. ix. 5" id="iv.xli-p17.3" parsed="|Matt|9|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.9.5">Matt. ix. 5</scripRef>.) “The former is the more
difficult,” saith He, “but since ye disbelieve it as being
hidden, and make the easier instead of the more difficult the
demonstration of my power, neither will I refuse to afford you this
proof.” Then saith He to the paralytic, “Arise, take up thy
bed, and go unto thy house.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xli-p18">“And how is this difficult,” saith one, “when
it is possible to kings also and rulers? For they too forgive
adulterers and homicides.” Thou art jesting, O man, who sayest
these things. For to forgive sins with God only is possible.
But rulers and kings, whether it is adulterers whom they forgive or
homicides, release them indeed from the present punishment; but
their sin they do not purge out. Though they should advance to
offices them that have been forgiven, though they should invest
them with the purple itself, though they should set the diadem upon
their heads, yet so they would only make them kings, but could not
free them from their sin. It being God alone who doeth this;
which accordingly in the Laver of Regeneration He will bring to
pass. For His grace touches the very soul, and thence plucks up
the sin by the root. Here is the reason why he that hath been
forgiven by the king may be seen with his soul yet impure, but the
soul of the baptized no longer so, but purer than the very
sun-beams, and such as it was originally formed, nay rather much
better than that. For it is blessed with a Spirit, on every side
enkindling it and making its holiness intense. And as when thou
art recasting iron or gold thou makest it pure and new once more,
just so the Holy Ghost also, recasting the soul in baptism as in a
furnace and consuming its sins, causes it to glisten with more
purity than all purest gold.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xli-p19">Further, the credibility of the resurrection of our
bodies he signifies to thee again from what follows: viz., that
since sin brought in death, now that the root is dried up, one must
not after that doubt of the destruction of the fruit. Therefore
having first mentioned “the forgiveness of sins,” thou dost
next confess also “the resurrection of the dead;” the one
guides thee as by hand on to the other.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xli-p20">Yet again, because the term Resurrection is not
sufficient to indicate the whole: for many after rising have
again departed, as those in the Old Testament, as Lazarus, as they
at the time of the crucifixion: one is bid to say, “and the
life everlasting,” that none may any longer have a notion of
death after that resurrection.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xli-p21">These words therefore Paul recalling to their
minds, saith, “What shall they do which are baptized for the
dead?” “For if there be no resurrection,” saith he,
“these words are but scenery. If there be no resurrection, how
persuade we them to believe things which we do not bestow?”
Just as if a person bidding another to deliver a document to the
effect that he had received so much, should never give the sum
named therein, yet after the subscription should demand of him the
specified monies. What then will remain for the subscriber to do,
now that he hath made himself responsible, without having received
what he admitted he had received? This then he here saith of
those who are baptized also. “What shall they do which are
baptized,” saith he, “having subscribed to the resurrection of
dead bodies, and not receiving it, but suffering fraud? And what
need was there at all of this confession, if the fact did not
follow?”<note place="end" n="303" id="iv.xli-p21.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xli-p22"> [Chrysostom’s explanation of this famous crux,

glorying in you which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die
daily.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xli-p25">See again whence he endeavors to establish the
doctrine, from his own suffrage: or rather not from his only, but
from that also of the other apostles. And this too is no small
thing; that the teachers whom you produce were full <pb n="246" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_246.html" id="iv.xli-Page_246" />of vehement conviction and signified
the same not by words only, but also by very deeds. Therefore,
you see, he doth not say simply, “we are persuaded,” for this
alone was not sufficient to persuade them, but he also furnishes
the proof by facts; as if he should say, “in words to confess
these things haply seems to you no marvel; but if we should also
produce unto you the voice which deeds send forth, what can ye have
to say against that? Hear ye then, how by our perils also day by
day we confess these things?” And he said not “I,” but
“we,” taking along with him all the apostles together, and
thereby at once speaking modestly and adding credibility to his
discourse.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xli-p26">For what can ye have to say? that we are deceiving
you when we preach these things, and that our doctrines come of
vain-glory? Nay, our perils suffer you not to pass such a
sentence. For who would choose to be in continual jeopardy to no
purpose and with no effect? Wherefore also he said, “Why do we
also stand in jeopardy every hour?” For if one should even
choose it through vain-glory, such his choice will be but for once
and again, not all his life long, like ours. For we have assigned
our whole life to this purpose.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xli-p27">“I protest by that glorying in you which I have in
Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily:” by glorying here, meaning
their advancement. Thus since he had intimated that his perils
were many, lest he might seem to say this by way of lamentation,
“far from grieving,” saith he, “I even glory in suffering
this for your sake.” And doubly, he saith, he takes delight in
it, both as being in jeopardy for their sakes and as beholding
their proficiency. Then doing what is usual with him, because he
had uttered great things, he refers both to Christ.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xli-p28">But how doth he “die daily?” by his readiness
and preparation for that event. And wherefore saith he these
words? Again by these also to establish the doctrine of the
resurrection. “For who would choose,” saith he, “to undergo
so many deaths, if there be no resurrection nor life after this? 
Yea, if they who believe in the resurrection would scarcely put
themselves in jeopardy for it except they were very noble of
heart: much more would not the unbeliever (so he speaks) choose
to undergo so many deaths and so terrible.” Thus, see by
degrees how very high he mounts up. He had said, “we stand in
jeopardy,” he added, “every hour,” then, “daily,” then,
“I not only ‘stand in jeopardy,’” saith he, but “I even
‘die:’” he concludes accordingly by pointing out also what
kind of deaths they were; thus saying,</p>

men I fought with beasts at Ephesus, what doth it profit me?”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xli-p30">What is, “if after the manner of men?”
“As far as pertains to men I fought with beasts: for what if
God snatched me out of those dangers?<note place="end" n="304" id="iv.xli-p30.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xli-p31"> [It would seem (although not certainly) from the
author’s mode of expression as if he supposed that the reference
was to an actual conflict in the arena, but the prevailing view is
that the phrase is metaphorical, partly because as a Roman citizen
the Apostle could not be legally subjected to that punishment,
partly because so remarkable a deliverance could hardly fail to be
recorded in the book of Acts, and partly because no reference is
made to anything of this kind in the long enumeration of his trials
in the eleventh chapter of Second Corinthians. The term was often
used by the ancients figuratively for contests with enraged men.
Its employment by the Apostle gives us a lively picture of the
perils to which he was exposed. Ignatius (not Polycarp, as Beet
says) in his Epistle to the Romans borrows this phrase, saying
“From Syria even unto Rome I am fighting with beasts, both by
land and sea, night and day, being bound to ten leopards, i.e., a
band of soldiers.” C.]</p></note>  So that I am he who ought most to
be in care about these things; I, who endure so great dangers and
have not yet received any return. For if no time of recompense is
at hand, but our reward is shut up in this present world, ours is
the greater loss. For ye have believed without jeopardy, but we
are slaughtered every day.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xli-p32">But all these things he said, not because he had no
advantage even in the very suffering, but on account of the
weakness of the many, and to establish them in the doctrine of the
resurrection: not because he himself was running for hire; for it
was a sufficient recompense to him to do that which was pleasing to
God. So that when he adds, “If in this life only we have hoped
in Christ, we are of all men most pitiable,” it is there again
for their sakes, that he might by the fear of this misery overthrow
their unbelief of the resurrection. And in condescension to their
weakness, he thus speaks. Since in truth, the great reward is to
please Christ at all times: and apart from the recompense, it is
a very great requital to be in jeopardy for His sake.</p>

“good” that which is easily deceived,) and also, as far as he
could, to make some allowance to them for the past with a view to
their return, and to remove from them and transfer to others the
greater part of his charges, and so by this way also to allure them
to repentance. Which he doth likewise in the Epistle to the
Galatians, saying, “But he that troubleth you shall bear his
judgment, whosoever he be.” (<scripRef passage="Gal. v. 10" id="iv.xli-p38.1" parsed="|Gal|5|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gal.5.10">Gal. v. 10</scripRef>.)</p>

For suddenly to cast every thing out of their hands, was the part
of drunkards and madmen, in not seeing any longer what they saw nor
believing what they had before confessed. But what is,
“righteously?” with a view to what is profitable and useful.
For it is possible to awake up unrighteously, when a man is
thoroughly roused up to the injury of his own soul. And well did
he add, “sin not,” implying that hence were the sins of their
unbelief. And in many places he covertly signifies this, that a
corrupt life is the parent of evil doctrines; as when he saith,
“The love of money is a root of all kinds of evil, which some
reaching after, have been led astray from the faith.” (<scripRef passage="1 Tim. vi. 10" id="iv.xli-p41.1" parsed="|1Tim|6|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.6.10">1 Tim. vi. 10</scripRef>.) Yea, and many of those who
are conscious of wickedness and would fain not pay its penalty are
by this fear damaged also in their faith concerning the
resurrection: even as they who do very virtuously desire even
daily to behold it.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xli-p42">“For some have no knowledge of God; I speak this
to move you to shame.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xli-p43">See how again he transfers his accusations to
others. For he said not, “Ye have no knowledge,” but, “some
have no knowledge.” Because disbelieving the resurrection is
the temper of one not fully aware that the power of God is
irresistable and sufficient for all things. For if out of the
things which are not He made the things that are, much more will He
be able to raise again those which have been dissolved.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xli-p44">And because he had touched them to the quick and
exceedingly mocked them, accusing them of gluttony, of folly, of
madness; mitigating those expressions, he saith, “I speak to move
you to shame,” that is, to set upright, to bring back, to make
you better, by this shame of yours. For he feared lest if he cut
too deep, he should cause them to start away.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xli-p45">[5.] But let us not consider these things as
spoken to them only, but as addressed now also to all who labor
under the same disease, and live a corrupt life. Since in truth
not they who hold corrupt doctrines only, but they too who are
holden of grievous sins, are both drunken and frantic. Wherefore
also to them may it be justly said, “Awake,” and especially to
those who are weighed down by the lethargy of avarice; who rob
wickedly. For there is a robbery which is good, the robbery of
Heaven, which injures not. And although in respect of money it is
impossible for one to become rich, unless another first become
poor: yet in spiritual things this is not so, but wholly the
reverse: it is impossible that any should become rich without
making another’s store plentiful. For if thou help no one, thou
wilt not be able to grow wealthy. Thus, whereas in temporal
things imparting causes diminution: in spiritual things, on the
contrary, imparting works increase, and the not imparting, this
produces great poverty and brings on extreme punishment. And this
is signified by him who buried the talent. Yea, and he too who
hath a word of wisdom, by imparting to another increases his own
abundance, by making many wise: but he that buries it at home,
deprives himself of his abundance by neglecting to win the profit
of the many. Again, he that had other gifts, by healing many
augmented his own gift: and was neither himself emptied by the
imparting, and filled many others with his own spiritual gift.
And in all spiritual things this rule abides unshaken. Thus also
in the Kingdom, he that makes many partakers with himself of the
Kingdom will hereby the more completely have the fruits of it in
return: but he that studies not to have any partaker will himself
be cast out of those many blessings. For if the wisdom of this
world of sense is not spent, though ten thousand are forcibly
seizing it; nor doth the artificer by making many artificers lose
his own skill; much less doth he who seizes the Kingdom make it
less, but then will our riches be increased when we call many to us
for that purpose.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xli-p46">Let us seize then the things which cannot be spent
but increase whilst we seize them: let us seize the things which
admit of none to defraud us of them by false accusation, none to
envy us for them. For so, if there were a place which had a
fountain of gold gushing forth with continual flood, and flowing
the more as more was drawn from it; and there were another place
which had a treasure buried in the earth; from which wouldest thou
desire to be enriched? Would it not be from the first? 
Plainly. But that this may not be a mere conception in words,
consider the saying in reference to the air and 
<pb n="248" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_248.html" id="iv.xli-Page_248" />the sun. For these are seized by all, and
satisfy all. These, however, whether men enjoy or do not enjoy
them, abide the same undiminished: but what I spake of is a much
greater thing; for spiritual wisdom abides not the same distributed
or not distributed: but it rather increases in the
distribution.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xli-p47">But if any endure not what I have said, but still
cleave to the poverty of worldly things, snatching at the things
which endure diminution: even in respect of those again, let him
call to mind the food of manna (<scripRef passage="Exod. xvi. 20" id="iv.xli-p47.1" parsed="|Exod|16|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Exod.16.20">Exod. xvi. 20</scripRef>.) and tremble at the example
of that punishment. For what happened in that instance, this same
result may one now also see in the case of covetous men. But what
then happened in worms were bred from their covetousness. This
also now happens in their case. For the measure of the food is
the same for all; we having but one stomach to fill; only thou who
feedest luxuriously hast more to get rid of. And as in that case
they who in their houses gathered more than the lawful quantity,
gathered not manna, but more worms and rottenness; just so both in
luxury and in covetousness, the gluttonous and drunken gather not
more dainties but more corruption.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xli-p48">[6.] Nevertheless, so much worse than they are the
men of our time, in that they experienced this once for all and
received correction; but these every day bringing into their own
houses this worm much more grievous than that, neither perceive it
nor are satiated. For that these things do resemble those in
respect of our useless labor on them: (for in regard of
punishment these are much worse:)  here is the proof for thee to
consider.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xli-p49">Wherein, I ask, differs the rich man from the
poor? Hath he not one body to clothe? one belly to feed? In
what then hath he the advantage? In cares, in spending himself,
in disobeying God, in corrupting the flesh, in wasting the soul.
Yea, these are the things in which he hath the advantage of the
poor: since if he had many stomachs to fill, perhaps he might
have somewhat to say, as that his need was more and the necessity
of expense greater. But even “now they may,” saith one,
“reply, that they fill many bellies, those of their domestics,
those of their hand-maidens.” But this is done, not through
need nor for humanity’s sake, but from mere pride: whence one
cannot put up with their excuse.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xli-p50">For why hast thou many servants? Since as in our
apparel we ought to follow our need only, and in our table, so also
in our servants. What need is there then? None at all. For,
in fact, one master need only employ one servant; or rather two or
three masters one servant. But if this be grievous, consider them
that have none and enjoy more prompt attendance. For God hath
made men sufficient to minister unto themselves, or rather unto
their neighbor also. And if thou believe it not, hear Paul
saying, “These hands ministered unto my necessities, and to them
that were with me.” (<scripRef passage="Acts xx. 34" id="iv.xli-p50.1" parsed="|Acts|20|34|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.20.34">Acts xx. 34</scripRef>.) After that he, the teacher
of the world and worthy of heaven, disdained not to serve
innumerable others; dost thou think it a disgrace, unless thou
carriest about whole herds of slaves, not knowing that this in
truth is what most of all brings shame upon thee? For to that end
did God grant us both hands and feet, that we might not stand in
need of servants.  Since not at all for need’s sake was the
class of slaves introduced, else even along with Adam had a slave
been formed; but it is the penalty of sin and the punishment of
disobedience. But when Christ came, He put an end also to this.
“For in Christ Jesus there is neither bond nor free.” (<scripRef passage="Gal. iii. 28" id="iv.xli-p50.2" parsed="|Gal|3|28|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gal.3.28">Gal. iii. 28</scripRef>.) So that it is not
necessary to have a slave: or if it be at all necessary, let it
be about one only, or at the most two. What mean the swarms of
servants? For as the sellers of sheep and the slave-dealers, so
do our rich men take their round, in the baths and in the
forum.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xli-p51">However, I will not be too exact. We will allow
you to keep a second servant. But if thou collect many, thou dost
it not for humanity’s sake, but in self-indulgence. Since if it
be in care for them, I bid thee occupy none of them in ministering
to thyself, but when thou hast purchased them and hast taught them
trades whereby to support themselves, let them go free. But when
thou scourgest, when thou puttest them in chains, it is no more a
work of humanity.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xli-p52">And I know that I am giving disgust to my hearers.
But what must I do? For this I am set, and I shall not cease to
say these things, whether any thing come of them or not. For what
means thy clearing the way before thee in the market place? Art
thou walking then among wild beasts that thou drivest away them
that meet thee? Be not afraid; none of these bite who approach
thee and walk near thee. But dost thou consider it an insult to
walk along side of other men? What madness is this, what
prodigious folly, when a horse is following close after thee, to
think not of his bringing on thee any insult; but if it be a man,
unless he be driven an hundred miles off, to reckon that he
disgraces thee. And why hast thou also servants to carry fasces,
employing freemen as slaves, or rather thyself living more
dishonorably than any slave? For, in truth, meaner than any
servant is he who bears about with him so much pride.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xli-p53">Therefore they shall not so much as have a <pb n="249" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_249.html" id="iv.xli-Page_249" />sight of the real liberty, who
have enslaved themselves to this grievous passion. Nay, if thou
must drive and clear away, let it not be them that come nigh thee,
but thine own pride which thou drivest away; not by thy servant,
but by thyself: not with this scourge, but with that which is
spiritual. Since now thy servant drives away them that walk by
thy side, but thou art thyself driven from thine high place more
disgracefully by thine own self-will than any servant can drive thy
neighbor. But if, descending from thy horse, thou wilt drive away
pride by humility, thou shalt sit higher and place thyself in
greater honor, needing no servant to do this. I mean, that when
thou art become modest and walkest on the ground, thou wilt be
seated on the car of humility which bears thee up to the very
heavens, that car which hath winged steeds<note place="end" n="307" id="iv.xli-p53.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xli-p54"> Alluding perhaps to the story of Bellerophon.</p></note>: but if falling from it, thou
pass into that of arrogance, thou wilt be in no better state than
the beggars who are drawn along the ground, nay even much more
wretched and pitiable than they: since them the imperfection of
their bodies compels thus to be drawn, but thee the disease of
thine own arrogance. “For every one that exalteth himself,”
saith He, “shall be abused.” (<scripRef passage="Matt. xxiii. 12" id="iv.xli-p54.1" parsed="|Matt|23|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.23.12">Matt. xxiii. 12</scripRef>.) That we then may not be
abused but exalted, let us approach towards that exaltation. For
thus also shall we “find rest for our souls” according to the
divine oracle, and shall obtain the true and most exalted honor;
the which may we all obtain, through the grace and mercy, &amp;c.
&amp;c.</p>

<p class="c27" id="iv.xlii-p3">But some one will say, How are the dead raised? and
with what manner of body do they come? Thou foolish one, that
which thou thyself sowest is not quickened, except it die.</p>

<p class="c24" id="iv.xlii-p4"><span class="c18" id="iv.xlii-p4.1">Gentle</span> and lowly as the
apostle is to a great degree every where, he here adopts a style
rather pungent, because of the impiety of the gainsayers. He is
not however content with this, but he also employs reasons and
examples, subduing thereby even the very contentious. And above
he saith, “Since by man came death, by man came also the
resurrection of the dead;” but here he solves an objection
brought in by the Gentiles. And see how again he abates the
vehemence of his censure; in that he said not, “but perhaps ye
will say,” but he set down the objector indefinitely, in order
that, although employing his impetuous style with all freedom, he
might not too severely wound his hearers. And he states two
difficulties, one touching the manner of the resurrection, the
other, the kind of bodies. For of both they on their part made a
question, saying, “How is that which hath been dissolved raised
up?” and, “with what manner of body do they come?” But what
means, “with what manner of body?” It is as if they had said,
“with this which hath been wasted, which hath perished, or with
some other?”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlii-p5">Then, to point out that the objects of their enquiry
are not questionable but admitted points, he at once meets them
more sharply, saying, “Thou foolish one, that which thou thyself
sowest is not quickened, except it die.” Which we also are wont
to do in the case of those who gainsay things acknowledged.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlii-p6">[2.] And wherefore did he not at once appeal to
the power of God? Because he is discoursing with unbelievers.
For when his discourse is addressed to believers, he hath not much
need of reasons. Wherefore having said elsewhere, “He shall
change the body of your humiliation, that it may be fashioned like
to the body of his glory,” (<scripRef passage="Philip. iii. 2" id="iv.xlii-p6.1" parsed="|Phil|3|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Phil.3.2">Philip. iii. 2</scripRef>.) and having indicated
somewhat more than the resurrection, he stated no analogies, but
instead of any demonstration, brought forward the power of God,
going on to say, “according to the working whereby He is able to
subject all things to Himself.” But here he also urges
reasons. That is, having established it from the Scriptures, he
adds also in what comes after, these things over and above, with an
eye to them who do not obey the Scriptures; and he saith, “O
foolish one, that which <span class="c18" id="iv.xlii-p6.2">Thou</span> sowest:”
i.e., “from thyself thou hast the proof of these things, by what
thou doest every day, and doubtest thou yet? Therefore do I call
thee foolish because of the things daily done by thine own self
thou art ignorant, and being thyself an artificer of a
resurrection, thou doubtest concerning God.” Wherefore very
emphatically he said, “what <span class="c18" id="iv.xlii-p6.3">Thou</span>
sowest<note place="end" n="308" id="iv.xlii-p6.4"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xlii-p7"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xlii-p7.1">σὺ ο σπείρεις</span>.</p></note>,” thou who

strong, as it is emphatical; <i>Stulte!  Tu quod seminas &amp;c.
O fool!  That which</i> THOU <i>sowest &amp;c.</i>  The force or
emphasis may be gathered thus. If God doth give a body unto that
seed which thou sowest for thine own use and benefit, much more
will the same God give a body unto the seed which He Himself doth
sow, seeing the end why He sows it, is not thy temporal benefit or
commodity, but His own immortal glory.” Dr. Jackson’s Works,
vol. iii. 438. See also vol. iii. 433–443.</p></note></p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlii-p9"><pb n="250" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_250.html" id="iv.xlii-Page_250" />And see how he
uses expressions appropriate to the purpose he had in view: thus,
“it is not quickened,” saith he, “except it die.”
Leaving, you see, the terms appropriate to seed, as that “it
buds,” and “grows,” and “is dissolved,” he adopts those
which correspond to our flesh, viz. “it is quickened,” and,
“except it die;” which do not properly belong to seeds, but to
bodies.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlii-p10">And he said not, “after it is dead it lives,”
but, which is a greater thing, “therefore it lives, because it
dies.” Seest thou, what I am always observing, that he
continually gives their argument the contrary turn? Thus what
they made a sure sign of our not rising again, the same he makes a
demonstration of our rising. For they said, “the body rises not
again, because it is dead.” What then doth he, retorting their
argument, say? “Nay, but unless it died, it could not rise
again: and therefore it rises again, because it died.” For as
Christ more clearly signifies this very thing, in the words,
“Except a grain of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth
by itself alone: but if it die, it beareth much fruit:”
(<scripRef passage="John xii. 24" id="iv.xlii-p10.1" parsed="|John|12|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.12.24">John xii. 24</scripRef>.) thence also Paul, drawing
this example, said not, “it doth not live,” but, “is not
quickened;” again assuming the power of God and showing that not
the nature of the ground, but God Himself, brings it all to
pass.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlii-p11">And what can be the reason that he did not bring
that forward, which was more akin to the subject: I mean, the
seed of mankind? (For our generation too begins from a sort of
decay, even as that of the corn.) Because it was not of equal
force, but the latter was a more complete instance: for he wants
a case of something that perished entirely, whereas this was but a
part; wherefore he rather alleges the other. Besides, that
proceeds from a living body and falls into a living womb; but here
it is no flesh, but the earth into which the seed is cast, and into
the same it is dissolved, like the body which is dead. Wherefore
on this account too the example was more appropriate.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlii-p12">[3.] <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 15.37" id="iv.xlii-p12.1" parsed="|1Cor|15|37|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.15.37">Ver. 37</scripRef>. “And he who soweth,
soweth not that body that shall be<note place="end" n="310" id="iv.xlii-p12.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xlii-p13"> This seems like a different reading: but it
appears afterwards that S. Chrysostom read the verse as it
stands. He quotes it therefore here in substance, not <i>
verbatim</i>.</p></note>.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlii-p14">For the things before spoken meet the question,
“how they are raised;” but this, the doubt, “with what manner
of body they come.” But what is, “thou sowest not that body
which shall be?” Not an entire ear of corn, nor new grain.
For here his discourse no longer regards the resurrection, but the
manner of the resurrection, what is the kind of body which shall
rise again; as whether it be of the same kind, or better and more
glorious. And he takes both from the same analogy, intimating
that it will be much better.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlii-p15">But the heretics, considering none of these things,
dart in upon us and say, “one body falls and another body rises
again. How then is there a resurrection? For the resurrection
is of that which was fallen. But where is that wonderful and
surprising trophy over death, if one body fall and another rise
again? For he will no longer appear to have given back that which
he took captive. And how can the alleged analogy suit the things
before mentioned?” Why, it is not one substance that is sown,
and another that is raised, but the same substance improved. Else
neither will Christ have resumed the same body when He became the
first-fruits of them that rise again: but according to you He
threw aside the former body, although it had not sinned, and took
another. Whence then is that other? For this body was from the
Virgin, but that, whence was it? Seest thou to what absurdity the
argument hath come round? For wherefore shows He the very prints
of the nails? Was it not to prove that it is that same body which
was crucified, and the same again that rose from the dead? And
what means also His type of Jonah? For surely it was not one
Jonah that was swallowed up and another that was cast out upon dry
land. And why did He also say, “Destroy this temple, and in
three days I will raise it up?” For that which was destroyed,
the same clearly He raised again. Wherefore also the Evangelist
added, that “He spake of the temple of His body.” (<scripRef passage="John ii. 19, 21" id="iv.xlii-p15.1" parsed="|John|2|19|0|0;|John|2|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.2.19 Bible:John.2.21">John ii. 19, 21</scripRef>.)</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlii-p16">What is that then which he saith, “Thou sowest not
the body that shall be?” i.e. not the ear of corn: for it is
the same, and not the same; the same, because the substance is the
same; but not the same, because this is more excellent, the
substance remaining the same but its beauty becoming greater, and
the same body rising up new. Since if this were not so, there
were no need of a resurrection, I mean if it were not to rise again
improved. For why did He at all pull down His house, except He
were about to build it more glorious?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlii-p17">This now, you see, he said to them who think
that it is utter corruption<note place="end" n="311" id="iv.xlii-p17.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xlii-p18"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xlii-p18.1">τὴν αὐτὴν φθοράν</span>.
The reading is perhaps corrupt.</p></note>. Next, that none again might
suspect from this place that another body is spoken of, he
qualifies the dark saying, and himself interprets what he had
spoken, not allowing the hearer to turn his thoughts from hence in
any other direction. What need is 
<pb n="251" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_251.html" id="iv.xlii-Page_251" />there then of our reasonings? Hear himself
speaking, and explaining the phrase, “Thou sowest not the body
that shall be.” For he straightway adds, “but a bare grain,
it may chance of wheat, or of some other kind;” i.e., it is not
the body that shall be; not so clothed, for instance; not having a
stalk and beard, but “a bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of
some other kind.”</p>

even as it pleased Him.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlii-p20">“Yes,” saith one, “but in that case it is the
work of nature.” Of what nature, tell me? For in that case
likewise God surely doeth the whole; not nature, nor the earth, nor
the rain. Wherefore also he making these things manifest, leaves
out both earth and rain, atmosphere, sun, and hands of husbandmen,
and subjoins, “God giveth it a body as it pleased Him.” Do
not thou therefore curiously inquire, nor busy thyself with the how
and in what manner, when thou hearest of the power and will of
God.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlii-p21">“And to each seed a body of its own.” Where
then is the alien matter which they speak of? For He giveth to
each “his own.” So that when he saith, “Thou sowest not
that which shall be,” he saith not this, that one substance is
raised up instead of another, but that it is improved, that it is
more glorious. For “to each of the seeds,” saith he, “a
body of its own.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlii-p22">[4.] From hence in what follows, he introducing
also the difference of the resurrection which shall then be. For
do not suppose, because grain is sown and all come up ears of corn,
that therefore there is also in the resurrection an equality of
honor. For in the first place, neither in seeds is there only one
rank, but some are more valuable, and some inferior. Wherefore
also he added, “to each seed a body of its own.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlii-p23">However, he is not content with this, but seeks
another difference greater and more manifest. For that thou
mayest not, when hearing, as I said, that all rise again, suppose
that all enjoy the same reward; he laid before even in the
preceding verses the seeds of this thought, saying, “But each in
his own order.” But he brings it out here also more clearly,
saying,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlii-p24"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 15.39" id="iv.xlii-p24.1" parsed="|1Cor|15|39|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.15.39">Ver. 39</scripRef>. “All flesh is not the
same flesh.” For why speak I, saith he, in respect of seeds? 
In respect of bodies let us agitate this point, concerning which we
are discoursing now. Wherefore also he addeth, and saith,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlii-p25">“But there is one flesh of men, another flesh of
beasts, another of birds, and another of fishes.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlii-p28">And what means he by these expressions? Wherefore
from the resurrection of the body did he throw himself into the
discourse of the stars and the sun? He did not throw himself out,
neither did he break off from his purpose; far from it: but he
still keeps to it. For whereas he had established the doctrine
concerning the resurrection, he intimates in what follows that
great will be then the difference of glory, though there be but one
resurrection. And for the present he divides the whole into
two: into “bodies celestial,” and “bodies terrestrial.”
For that the bodies are raised again, he signified by the corn: 
but that they are not all in the same glory, he signifies by
this. For as the disbelief of the resurrection makes men supine,
so again it makes them indolent to think that all are vouchsafed
the same reward. Wherefore he corrects both. And the one in the
preceeding verses he had completed; but this he begins now. And
having made two ranks, of the righteous and of sinners, these same
two he subdivides again into many parts, signifying that neither
righteous nor sinners shall obtain the same; neither righteous men,
all of them, alike with other righteous, nor sinners with other
sinners.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlii-p29">Now he makes, you see, first, one separation between
righteous and sinners, where he says, “bodies celestial, and
bodies terrestrial:” by the “terrestrial” intimating the
latter, and by the “celestial,” the former. Then farther he
introduces a difference of sinners from sinners, saying, “All
flesh is not the same flesh, but there is one flesh of fishes,
another of birds, and another of beasts.” And yet all are
bodies; but some are in more, and some in lesser vileness. And
that in their manner of living too, and in their very
constitution.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlii-p30">And having said this, he ascends again to the
heaven, saying, “There is one glory of the sun, and another glory
of the moon.” For as in the earthly bodies there is a
difference, so also in the heavenly; and that difference no
ordinary one, but reaching even to the uttermost: there being not
only a difference between sun and moon, and stars, but also between
stars and stars. For what though they be all in the heaven? yet
some have a larger, others a less share of glory. What do we
learn from hence? That although they be all in God’s kingdom,
all shall not enjoy the same reward; and though all sinners be in
hell, all shall not endure the same punishment. Wherefore he
added,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlii-p31"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 15.42" id="iv.xlii-p31.1" parsed="|1Cor|15|42|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.15.42">Ver. 42</scripRef>. “So also is the
resurrection of the dead.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlii-p32">“So,” How? with considerable difference. <pb n="252" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_252.html" id="iv.xlii-Page_252" />Then leaving this doctrine as
sufficiently proved, he again comes to the proof itself of the
resurrection and the manner of it, saying,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlii-p33">[5.] “It is sown in corruption, it is
raised in incorruption.” And observe his consideration. As in
the case of seeds, he used the term proper to bodies, saying, “it
is not quickened, except it die:” so in the case of bodies, the
expression belonging to seeds, saying, “it is sown in corruption,
it is raised in incorruption.” He said not, “is produced<note place="end" n="312" id="iv.xlii-p33.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xlii-p34"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xlii-p34.1">φύεται</span>.</p></note>,” that
thou mightest not think it a work of the earth, but is
“raised.” And by sowing here, he means not our generation in
the womb, but the burial in the earth of our dead bodies, their
dissolution, their ashes. Wherefore having said, “it is sown in
corruption, it is raised in incorruption,” he adds,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlii-p35"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 15.43" id="iv.xlii-p35.1" parsed="|1Cor|15|43|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.15.43">Ver. 43</scripRef>. “It is sown in
dishonor.” For what is more unsightly than a corpse in
dissolution? “It is raised in glory.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlii-p36">“It is sown in weakness.” For before thirty
days the whole is gone, and the flesh cannot keep itself together
nor hold out for one day. “It is raised in power.” For
there shall nothing prevail against it for all the future.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlii-p37">Here is why he stood in need of those former
analogies, lest many on hearing of these things, that they are
“raised in incorruption and glory and power,” might suppose
that there is no difference among those who rise again. For all
indeed rise again, both in power and in incorruption; and in this
glory of their incorruption yet are not all in the same state of
honor and safety.</p>

righteous, and the victory shall be His, the natural soul also
being present<note place="end" n="315" id="iv.xlii-p41.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xlii-p42"> i.e. It is true the body may be called
spiritual, because of the Spirit’s indwelling: but it is not
wholly and entirely so. For sometimes the Spirit leaves men when
they sin, and even when the Spirit does not leave them, vitality
leaves the body, which then becomes untenanted; whereas at the
resurrection the body being quickened, the Spirit remains in them
for ever. [This seems to be a satisfactory explanation of a
passage difficult in the original, (<i>satis tenebricosa</i> as Dr.
Field says,) and quite uncertain as to the text. C.]</p></note>.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlii-p43">For either it was some such thing which he intimated
by saying, “a spiritual body,” or that it shall be lighter and
more subtle and such as even to be wafted upon air; or rather he
meant both these. And if thou disbelieve the doctrine, behold the
heavenly bodies which are so glorious and (for this time) so
durable, and abide in undecaying tranquillity; and believe thou
from hence, that God can also make these corruptible bodies
incorruptible and much more excellent than those which are
visible.</p>

living soul: the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlii-p45">And yet the one indeed is written, but the other not
written. How then said he, “it is written?” He modified the
expression according to the issue of events: as he is wont
continually to do: and indeed as it is the way of every
prophet. For so Jerusalem, the prophet said, should be “called
a city of righteousness;” (<scripRef passage="Is. i. 26" id="iv.xlii-p45.1" parsed="|Isa|1|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.1.26">Is. i. 26</scripRef>.) yet it was not so called.
What then? Did the prophet speak false? By no means. For he
is speaking of the issue of events. And that Christ too should be
called Immanuel; (<scripRef passage="Is. vii. 14" id="iv.xlii-p45.2" parsed="|Isa|7|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.7.14">Is. vii.
14</scripRef>.) yet was he not so
called. But the facts utter this voice; so also here, “the last
Adam became a life-giving Spirit.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlii-p46">And these things he said that thou mayest learn that
the signs and pledges both of the present life and of that which is
to come have already come upon us; to wit, of the present life,
Adam, and of the life to come, Christ. For since he sets down the
better things as matters of hope, he signifies that their beginning
hath already come to pass, and their root and their fountain been
brought to light. But if the root and the fountain be evident to
all, there is no need to doubt of the fruits. Wherefore he saith,
“The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.” And elsewhere
too, He “shall quicken your mortal bodies through His Spirit that
dwelleth in you.” (<scripRef passage="Rom. vii. 11" id="iv.xlii-p46.1" parsed="|Rom|7|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.7.11">Rom. vii. 11</scripRef>.) It is the Spirit’s work
then to quicken.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlii-p47">Further, lest any should say, “why are the
worse things the elder? and why hath the one sort, to wit, the
natural, come to pass not merely as far as the first-fruits, but
altogether; the other as far as the first-fruits only?”—he
signifies that the principles also of each were so ordered<note place="end" n="316" id="iv.xlii-p47.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xlii-p48"> i.e. Why does the worst principle come first? Why
is the natural principle wholly developed not only in Adam, the
first-fruits, but in us and all mankind? And why is the spiritual
principal which is to produce the resurrection, not yet developed
in us, but only in Christ our first-fruits? The answer is, So is
the will of God, by whose ordinance it is that the natural should
come first, the spiritual afterwards.</p></note>.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlii-p49"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 15.46" id="iv.xlii-p49.1" parsed="|1Cor|15|46|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.15.46">Ver. 46</scripRef>. “For that is not
first,” saith he, “which is spiritual, but that which is
natural, then that which is spiritual.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlii-p50">And he saith not, why, but is content with <pb n="253" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_253.html" id="iv.xlii-Page_253" />the ordinance of God, having the
evidence from the facts testifying to that most excellent œconomy
of God, and implying that our state is always going forward to the
better; at the same time by this also adding credibility to his
argument. For if the lesser have come to pass, much more ought we
to expect the better.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlii-p51">[7.] Since then we are to enjoy so great
blessings, let us take our station in this array, and bewail not
the departed, but rather those that have ended their life ill.
For so the husbandman, when he sees the grain dissolving, doth not
mourn; rather, as long as he beholds it continuing solid in the
ground he is in fear and trembling, but when he sees it dissolved
rejoices. For the beginning of the future crop is its
dissolving. So let us also then rejoice when the corruptible
house falls, when the man is sown. And marvel not if he called
the burial “a sowing;” for, in truth, this is the better
sowing: inasmuch as that sowing is succeeded by deaths and labors
and dangers and cares; but this, if we lived well, by crowns and
rewards; and that, by corruption and death but this by incorruption
and immortality, and those infinite blessings. To that kind of
sowing there went embraces and pleasures and sleep: but to this,
only a voice coming down from heaven, and all is at once brought to
perfection. And he that rises again is no more led to a life full
of toil, but to a place where anguish and sorrow and sighing are
fled away.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlii-p52">If thou requirest protection and therefore mournest
thy husband, betake thyself to God, the common Protector and
Saviour and Benefactor of all, to that irresistible alliance, to
that ready aid, to that abiding shelter which is every where
present, and is as a wall unto us on every side.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlii-p53">“But your intercourse was a thing desirable and
lovely.” I too know it. But if thou wilt trust sound reason
with this grief, and wilt consider with thyself who hath taken him
away, and that by nobly bearing it thou offerest thy mind as a
sacrifice to our God, even this wave will not be too strong for
thee to stem. And that which time brings to pass, the same do
thou by thy self-command. But if thou shalt yield to weakness,
thine emotion will cease indeed in time, but it will bring thee no
reward.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlii-p54">And together with these reasons collect also
examples, some in the present life, some in the Holy Scriptures.
Consider that Abraham slew his own son, and neither shed a tear nor
uttered a bitter word. “But he,” you say, “was
Abraham.” Nay, thou surely hast been called to a nobler field
of action<note place="end" n="317" id="iv.xlii-p54.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xlii-p55"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xlii-p55.1">μεὶζονα σκάμματα</span>.</p></note>. And Job
grieved indeed, but so much as was proper for a father who loved
his children and was very solicitious for the departed; whereas
what we now do, is surely the part of haters and enemies. For if
when a man was taken up to court and crowned, thou wert smiting
thyself and lamenting, I should not say that thou wast a friend of
him who was crowned, but a great enemy and adversary. “Nay,”
say you, “not even as it is do I mourn for him, but for
myself.” Well, but this is not the part of an affectionate
person, to wish for thine own sake that he were still in the
conflict and subject to the uncertainty of the future, when he
might be crowned and come to anchor; or that he should be tossed in
mid ocean, when he might have been in port.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlii-p56">[8.] “But I know not whither he hath
gone,” say you. Wherefore knowest thou not, tell me? For
according as he lived well or otherwise, it is evident whither he
will go. “Nay, on this very account I lament,” say you,
“because he departed being a sinner<note place="end" n="318" id="iv.xlii-p56.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xlii-p57"> Bingham observes, lib. xv. cap. 3. sect. 16.
“Another reason for praying for the dead was, they conceived all
men to die with some remainders of frailty and corruption, and
therefore desired that God would deal with them according to His
mercy, and not in strict justice according to their merits.”
“These prayers,” he proceeds to say, see lib. xxiii. cap. 3.
sect. 3. and 13. “are not made upon the Romish supposition of the
soul’s being in purgatory or any place of torment, but on
principles that perfectly overthrow it.” For they call those
for whom they offer, Saints including among them the Blessed
Virgin, the Apostles and Prophets: and they represent them as
having ‘pleased God,’ “being at rest,” “sleeping in
Christ,” “departed in His Faith,” and other equivalent
expressions. <i>Vid</i>. Brett’s <i>Liturgies</i>, p.
270–272. Ed. 1838. See also Bp. Bull, vol. ii. 261. Oxford
Ed.</p></note>.” This is a mere pretext and
excuse. For if this were the reason of thy mourning for the
departed, thou oughtest to have formed and corrected him, when he
was alive. The fact is thou dost every where look to what
concerns thyself, not him.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlii-p58">But grant that he departed with sin upon him,
even on this account one ought to rejoice, that he was stopped
short in his sins and added not to his iniquity; and help him as
far as possible, not by tears, but by prayers and supplications and
alms and offerings. For not unmeaningly have these things been
devised, nor do we in vain make mention of the departed in the
course of the divine mysteries, and approach God in their behalf,
beseeching the Lamb Who is before us, Who taketh away the sin of
the world;—not in vain, but that some refreshment may thereby
ensue to them. Not in vain doth he that standeth by the altar cry
out when the tremendous mysteries are celebrated, “For all that
have fallen asleep in Christ, and for those who perform
commemorations in their behalf<note place="end" n="319" id="iv.xlii-p58.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xlii-p59"> These expressions are not <i>verbatim</i>
either in St. Chrysostom’s or in any other of the Liturgies
translated by Brett, but in substance they are in all.</p></note>.” For if there were no
commemorations for them, these things would not have been spoken: 
since our service is not a mere stage show, God forbid! yea, it is
by <pb n="254" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_254.html" id="iv.xlii-Page_254" />the ordinance of the
Spirit that these things are done.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlii-p60">Let us then give them aid and perform
commemoration for them. For if the children of Job were purged by
the sacrifice of their father, why dost thou doubt that when we too
offer for the departed, some consolation arises to them? since God
is wont to grant the petitions of those who ask for others. And
this Paul signified saying, “that in a manifold Person<note place="end" n="320" id="iv.xlii-p60.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xlii-p61"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xlii-p61.1">ἐν

reading is <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xlii-p61.2">ἐκ πολλῶν

Apostle was alluding to the Liturgical Service as the voice of the
whole mystical Body of Christ. See his comment on the place in
Hom. 2 on 2 Cor. §. 3, 4. Ed. Bened. [The singular reading of
Chrysostom in this place does not seem to be sustained by any Greek
<span class="c18" id="iv.xlii-p61.3">mss</span>., but is represented in several
codices of the old Itala version. On the principle of the <i>

ground. C.]</p></note> your gift

weary in giving aid to the departed, both by offering on their
behalf and obtaining prayers for them: for the common Expiation
of the world is even before us. Therefore with boldness do we
then intreat for the whole world, and name their names with those
of martyrs, of confessors, of priests. For in truth one body are
we all, though some members are more glorious than others; and it
is possible from every source to gather pardon<note place="end" n="321" id="iv.xlii-p61.5"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xlii-p62"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xlii-p62.1">συγγνωμήν</span>.</p></note> for them, from our prayers, from
our gifts in their behalf, from those whose names are named with
theirs. Why therefore dost thou grieve? Why mourn, when it is
in thy power to gather so much pardon for the departed?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlii-p63">[9.] Is it then that thou art become desolate and
hast lost a protector? Nay, never mention this. For thou hast
not surely lost thy God. And so, as long as thou hast Him, He
will be better to thee than husband and father and child and
kinsman: since even when they were alive, He it was who did all
things.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlii-p64">These things therefore think upon, and say
with David, “The Lord is my light and my Saviour<note place="end" n="322" id="iv.xlii-p64.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xlii-p65"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xlii-p65.1">σωτὴρ</span> LXX.</p></note>, whom shall

thou shalt have Him to care for thee now more than before, by how
much thou art in a state of greater difficulty.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlii-p66">Or hast thou lost a child? Thou hast not
lost it; say not so. This thing is sleep, not death; removal, not
destruction; a journeying from the worse unto the better<note place="end" n="323" id="iv.xlii-p66.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xlii-p67"> The same idea is thus expressed by
Tertullian. “Why mourn, if thy faith be that he hath not
perished? Why bear impatiently <i>his</i> being withdrawn for a
while, of whom thou believest that he will return? It is but a
journey, which thou accountest death. It is not meet to mourn for
him who is gone before, but simply to miss him and long for
him.” <i>De Patient</i>. c. 9.</p></note>. Do not
then provoke God to anger; but propitiate Him. For if thou
bearest it nobly, there will thence accrue some relief both to the
departed and to thyself; but if the contrary, thou dost the more
kindle God’s anger. For if when a servant was chastised by his
master, thou didst stand by and complain, thou wouldest the more
exasperate the master against thyself. Do not then so; but give
thanks, that hereby also this cloud of sadness may be scattered
from thee. Say with that blessed one, “the Lord gave, and the
Lord hath taken away.” (<scripRef passage="Job i. 21" id="iv.xlii-p67.1" parsed="|Job|1|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Job.1.21">Job i. 21</scripRef>.) Consider how many more
well-pleasing in His sight have never received children at all, nor
been called fathers. “Nor would I wish to have been so,” say
you, “for surely it were better not to have had experience than
after having tasted the pleasure to fall from it.” Nay, I
beseech thee, say not so, provoke not thus also the Lord to
wrath: but for what thou hast received, give Him thanks; and for
what thou hast not to the end, give Him glory. Job said not that
which thou sayest unthankfully, “it were better not to have
received,” but both for the one he gave thanks, saying, “The
Lord gave;” and for the other he blessed God, saying, “The Lord
hath taken away, blessed be the name of the Lord for ever.” And
his wife he thus silenced, justifying himself against her, and
uttering those admirable words, “Have we received good at the
hand of the Lord, and shall we not receive evil?” And yet after
this a fiercer temptation befel him: yet was he not even thus
unnerved, but in like manner bore it nobly and glorified God.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlii-p68">This also do thou, and consider with thyself that
man hath not taken him, but God who made him, who more than thyself
cares for him and knows what is good for him: who is no enemy nor
lier-in-wait. See how many, living, have made life intolerable to
their parents. “But seest thou not the right-hearted ones?”
say you. I see these too, but even these are not so safe as thy
child is. For though they are now approved, yet it is uncertain
what their end will be; but for him thou hast no longer any fear,
nor dost thou tremble lest anything should happen to him or he
experience any change.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlii-p69">These things also do thou consider respecting a good
wife and guardian of thine house, and for all things give thanks
unto God. And even if thou shalt lose a wife, give thanks.
Perhaps God’s will is to lead thee to continence, He calls thee
to a nobler field of conflict, He was pleased to set thee free from
this bond. If we thus command ourselves, we shall both gain the
joy of this life and obtain the crowns which are to come, &amp;c.

present life and that which is to come: but this between that
before grace and that after grace. And he stated it with a view
to the most excellent way of life, saying,—(for to hinder men, as
I said, from such confidence in the resurrection as would make them
neglectful of their practice and of perfection, from this topic
also again he renders them anxious and exhorts to virtue,
saying,)—“The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man
is the Lord from heaven:” calling the whole by the name of
“man<note place="end" n="324" id="iv.xliii-p4.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xliii-p5"> i.e., embodying as it were the whole of the two
states of being which he is describing in the personal appellation
of Man: as in the phrase, Old Man and New Man: &amp;c.</p></note>,” and
naming the one from the better, and the other from the worst
part.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xliii-p6"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 15.48" id="iv.xliii-p6.1" parsed="|1Cor|15|48|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.15.48">Ver. 48</scripRef>. “As is the earthy, such
are they also that are earthy:” so shall they perish and have
an end. “As is the heavenly, such are they also that are
heavenly:” so shall they abide immortal and glorious.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xliii-p7">What then? Did not This Man too die? He died
indeed, but received no injury therefrom, yea rather by this He put
an end to death. Seest thou how on this part of his subject also,
he makes use of death to establish the doctrine of the
resurrection? “For having, as I said before, the beginning and
the head,” so he speaks, “doubt not of the whole body.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xliii-p8">Moreover also he frames hereby his advice concerning
the best way of living, proposing standards of a lofty and severe
life and of that which is not such, and bringing forward the
principles of both these, of the one Christ, but of the other
Adam. Therefore neither did he simply say, “of the earth,”
but “earthy,” i.e., “gross, nailed down to things
present:” and again with respect to Christ the reverse, “the
Lord from heaven.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xliii-p9">[2.] But if any should say, “therefore the
Lord hath not a body<note place="end" n="325" id="iv.xliii-p9.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xliii-p10"> As the Manichees did, and before them the Gnostic
sects.</p></note> because He is said to be “from
heaven,” although what is said before is enough to stop their
mouths: yet nothing hinders our silencing them from this
consideration also: viz. what is, “the Lord from heaven?”
Doth he speak of His nature, or His most perfect life? It is I
suppose evident to every one that he speaks of His life.
Wherefore also he adds,</p>

The external evidence is decidedly in its favor, but not the

the heavenly,” i.e., let us practise all goodness.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xliii-p13">But besides this, I would fain ask thee, is it of
nature that it is said, “he that is of the earth, earthy,” and,
“the Lord from heaven?”  “Yea,” saith one. What then? 
Was Adam only “earthy,” or had he also another kind of
substance congenial with heavenly and incorporeal beings, which the
Scripture calls “soul,” and “spirit?” Every one sees that
he had this also. Therefore neither was the Lord from above only
although He is said to be “from heaven,” but He had also
assumed our flesh. But Paul’s meaning is such as this: “as
we have borne the image of the earthy,” i.e., evil deeds, “let
us also bear the image of the heavenly,” the manner of life which
is in the heavens. Whereas if he were speaking of nature, the
thing needed not exhortation nor advice. So that hence also it is
evident that the expression relates to our manner of life.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xliii-p14">Wherefore also he introduces the saying in the
manner of advice and calls it an “image,” here too again
showing that he is speaking of conduct, not of nature. For
therefore are we become earthy, because we have done evil: not
because we were originally formed “earthy,” but because we
sinned. For sin came first, and then death and then the sentence,
“Dust thou <pb n="256" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_256.html" id="iv.xliii-Page_256" />art, and unto dust
shalt thou return.” (<scripRef passage="Gen. iii. 19" id="iv.xliii-p14.1" parsed="|Gen|3|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.3.19">Gen. iii. 19</scripRef>.) Then also entered in
the swarm of the passions. For it is not simply the being born
“of earth” that makes a man “earthy,” (since the Lord also
was of this mass and lump<note place="end" n="327" id="iv.xliii-p14.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xliii-p15"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xliii-p15.1">μάζης καὶ
φυράματος</span>.</p></note>,) but the doing earthly things,
even as also he is made “heavenly” by performing things meet
for heaven.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xliii-p16">But enough: for why need I labor overmuch in the
proof of this, when the apostle himself goes on to unfold the
thought to us, thus saying,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xliii-p17"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 15.50" id="iv.xliii-p17.1" parsed="|1Cor|15|50|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.15.50">Ver. 50</scripRef>. “Now this I say,
brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of
God.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xliii-p18">Seest thou how he explains himself again, relieving
us of the trouble? which he often doth: for by flesh he here
denotes men’s evil deeds, which he hath done also elsewhere; as
when he saith, “But ye are not in the flesh:” and again,
“So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.”
(<scripRef passage="Rom. viii. 8, 9" id="iv.xliii-p18.1" parsed="|Rom|8|8|8|9" osisRef="Bible:Rom.8.8-Rom.8.9">Rom. viii. 8, 9</scripRef>.) So that when he
saith, “Now this I say,” he means nothing else than this: 
“therefore said I these things that thou mayest learn that evil
deeds conduct not to a kingdom.” Thus from the resurrection he
straightway introduced also the doctrine of the kingdom also;
wherefore also he adds, “neither doth corruption inherit
incorruption,<note place="end" n="328" id="iv.xliii-p18.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xliii-p19"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xliii-p19.1">κληρονομὴ</span> rec. text.</p></note>” i.e.,
neither shall wickedness inherit that glory and the enjoyment of
the things incorruptible. For in many other places he calls
wickedness by this name, saying, “He that soweth to the flesh,
shall of the flesh reap corruption.” (<scripRef passage="Gal. vi. 8" id="iv.xliii-p19.2" parsed="|Gal|6|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gal.6.8">Gal. vi. 8</scripRef>.) Now if he were speaking of
the body and not of evil doing, he would not have said
“corruption.” For he nowhere calls the body “corruption,”
since neither is it corruption, but a thing corruptible: 
wherefore proceeding to discourse also of it, he calls it not
“corruption,” but “corruptible,” saying, “for this
corruptible must put on incorruption.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xliii-p20">[3.] Next, having completed his advice concerning
our manner of life, according to his constant custom blending
closely subject with subject, he passes again to the doctrine of
the resurrection of the body: as follows:</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xliii-p21"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 15.51" id="iv.xliii-p21.1" parsed="|1Cor|15|51|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.15.51">Ver. 51</scripRef>. “Behold, I tell you a
mystery.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xliii-p22">It is something awful and ineffable and which all
know not, which he is about to speak of: which also indicates the
greatness of the honor he confers on them; I mean, his speaking
mysteries to them. But what is this?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xliii-p23">“We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be
changed.” He means as follows: “we shall not all die,
‘but we shall all be changed,’” even those who die not. For
they too are mortal. “Do not thou therefore because thou diest,
on this account fear,” saith he, “as if thou shouldest not rise
again: for there are, there are some who shall even escape this,
and yet this suffices them not for that resurrection, but even
those bodies which die not must be changed and be transformed into
incorruption.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xliii-p24"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 15.52" id="iv.xliii-p24.1" parsed="|1Cor|15|52|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.15.52">Ver. 52</scripRef>. “In a moment, in the
twinkling of an eye, at the last trump.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xliii-p25">After he had discoursed much of the resurrection,
then opportunely he points out also its very marvellous
character. As thus: “not this only,” saith he, “is
wonderful that our bodies first turn to corruption, and then are
raised; nor that the bodies which rise again after their corruption
are better than these present ones; nor that they pass on to a much
better state, nor that each receives back his own and none that of
another; but that things so many and so great, and surpassing all
man’s reason and conception, are done “in a moment,” i.e., in
an instant of time: and to show this more clearly, “in the
twinkling of an eye,” saith he, “while one can wink an
eyelid.” Further, because he had said a great thing and full of
astonishment; that so many and so great results should take place
so quickly; he alleges, to prove it, the credibility of Him who
performs it; as follows, “For the trumpet shall sound, and the
dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.”
The expression, “we,” he uses not of himself, but of them that
are then found alive.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xliii-p26"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 15.53" id="iv.xliii-p26.1" parsed="|1Cor|15|53|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.15.53">Ver. 53</scripRef>. “For this corruptible
must put on incorruption.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xliii-p27">Thus lest any, hearing that “flesh and blood
cannot inherit the kingdom of God,” should suppose that our
bodies do not rise again; he adds, “this corruptible must put on
incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.” Now the
body is “corruptible,” the body is “mortal:” so that the
body indeed remains, for it is the body which is put on; but its
mortality and corruption vanish away, when immortality and
incorruption come upon it. Do not thou therefore question
hereafter how it shall live an endless life, now that thou hast
heard of its becoming incorruptible.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xliii-p28">[4.] <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 15.54" id="iv.xliii-p28.1" parsed="|1Cor|15|54|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.15.54">Ver. 54</scripRef>. “But when this
corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this moral shall
have put on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is
written, Death is swallowed up in victory.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xliii-p29">Thus, since he was speaking of great and secret
things, he again takes prophecy (<scripRef passage="Hosea xiii. 14" id="iv.xliii-p29.1" parsed="|Hos|13|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Hos.13.14">Hosea xiii. 14</scripRef>.) to confirm his word.
“Death is swallowed up in victory:<note place="end" n="329" id="iv.xliii-p29.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xliii-p30"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xliii-p30.1">εἰς νίκος</span>; i.e. <span class="Greek" id="iv.xliii-p30.2">εἰς τέλος</span>.</p></note>” i.e., utterly; not so much as
a fragment of it remains nor a hope of returning, incorruption
having consumed corruption.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xliii-p31"><pb n="257" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_257.html" id="iv.xliii-Page_257" /><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 15.55" id="iv.xliii-p31.1" parsed="|1Cor|15|55|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.15.55">Ver. 55</scripRef>. “O death, where is thy
sting? O grave, where is thy victory?”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xliii-p32">Seest thou his noble soul? how even as one who is
offering sacrifices for victory, having become inspired and seeing
already things future as things past, he leaps and tramples upon
death fallen at his feet, and shouts a cry of triumph over its head
where it lies, exclaiming mightily and saying, “O death, where is
thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?” It is clean gone,
it is perished, it is utterly vanished away, and in vain hast thou
done all those former things. For He not only disarmed death and
vanquished it, but even destroyed it, and made it quite cease from
being.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xliii-p33"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 15.56" id="iv.xliii-p33.1" parsed="|1Cor|15|56|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.15.56">Ver. 56</scripRef>. “Now the sting of death
is sin; and the power of sin is the law.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xliii-p34">Seest thou how the discourse is of the death of the
body? therefore also of the resurrection of the body. For if
these bodies do not rise again, how is death “swallowed up?”
And not this only, but how is “the law the power of sin?” For
that “sin” indeed is “the sting of death,” and more bitter
than it, and by it hath its power, is evident; but how is “the
law also the power” thereof? Because without the law sin was
weak, being practised indeed, but not able so entirely to
condemn: since although the evil took place, it was not so
clearly pointed out. So that it was no small change which the law
brought in, first causing us to know sin better, and then enhancing
the punishment. And if meaning to check sin it did but develop it
more fearfully, this is no charge against the physician, but
against the abuse of the remedy. Since even the presence of
Christ made the Jews’ burden heavier, yet must we not therefore
blame it, but while we the more admire it, we must hate them the
more, for having been injured by things which ought to have
profited them? Yea, to show that it was not the law of itself
which gives strength to sin, Christ Himself fulfilled it all and
was without sin.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xliii-p35">But I would have thee consider how from this topic
also he confirms the resurrection. For if this were the cause of
death, viz. our committing sin, and if Christ came and took away
sin, and delivered us from it through baptism, and together with
sin put an end also to the law in the transgression of which sin
consists, why doubtest thou any more of the resurrection? For
whence, after all this, is death to prevail? Through the law? 
Nay, it is done away. Through sin? Nay, it is clean
destroyed.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xliii-p37">For the trophy He Himself erected, but the crowns He

<p class="c19" id="iv.xliii-p44">What sayest thou? Labor again? But followed by
crowns, and those above the heavens. For that former labor on
man’s expulsion from paradise, was the punishment of his
transgressions; but this is the ground of the rewards to come. So
that it cannot in fact be labor, both on this account and by reason
of the great help which it receives from above: which is the
cause of his adding also, “in the Lord.” For the purpose of
the former was that we might suffer punishment; but of this, that
we might obtain the good things to come.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xliii-p45">Let us not therefore sleep, my beloved. For
it cannot, it cannot be that any one by sloth should attain to the

and enduring innumerable labors, we are able to reach those
blessings. See ye not how vast this distance between heaven and
earth? And how great a conflict is at hand? And how prone a
thing to evil man is? And how easily sin “besets us?” And
how many snares are in the way?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xliii-p47">Why then do we draw upon ourselves so great cares
over and above those of nature, and give ourselves more trouble,
and make our burden greater? Is it not enough, our having to care
for our food and clothing and houses? Is it not enough to take
thought for things necessary? Although even from these Christ
withdraws us, saying, “Be not anxious for your life what ye shall
eat, neither for your body what ye shall put on.” (<scripRef passage="Matt. vi. 25" id="iv.xliii-p47.1" parsed="|Matt|6|25|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.6.25">Matt. vi. 25</scripRef>.) But if one ought not to be
anxious for necessary food and clothing, nor for to-morrow; they
who bring on so great a mass of rubbish and bury themselves under
it, when shall they shall have power to emerge? Hast thou not
heard Paul saying, “No soldier on service entangleth himself in
the affairs of this life?” (<scripRef passage="2 Tim. ii. 4" id="iv.xliii-p47.2" parsed="|2Tim|2|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Tim.2.4">2 Tim. ii. 4</scripRef>.) But we even live
luxuriously and eat and drink to excess and endure buffeting for
external <pb n="258" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_258.html" id="iv.xliii-Page_258" />things, but in the
things of heaven behave ourselves unmanly. Know ye not that the
promise is too high for man?  It cannot be that one walking on the

study to live like men, but are become worse than the brutes.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xliii-p48">Know ye not before what a tribunal we are to

them. What indulgence then shall we have, when commanded as we
are to pass over the old lines, we weave ourselves a thread of life
by a yet more scanty measure than theirs? What plea shall deliver
us? Who will stand up and help us when we are punished? There

the other Epistles in the conclusion. For what reason then doth
he handle here this part only of practical morality? Because the
greater part also of what had been spoken before was of an ethical
nature: I mean, where he chastised the fornicator; where he was
correcting those who go to law among Gentiles; where he terrified
the drunkards and the gluttons; where he condemned the seditious,
the contentious, and those who loved to have the preeminence; where
those who unworthily approach the Mysteries were delivered over by
him unto that intolerable sentence; where he discoursed concerning
love. For this cause, I say, the subject which most pressed on
him, viz. the aid required for the saints, this alone he
mentions.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xliv-p5">And observe his consideration. When he had
persuaded them concerning the resurrection, and made them more
earnest, then and not till then he discusses this point also.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xliv-p6">It is true indeed that on these matters he had
spoken to them before, when he said, “If we sowed unto you
spiritual things, is it a great matter if we shall reap your carnal
things?” <pb n="259" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_259.html" id="iv.xliv-Page_259" />And, “Who
planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof?” But
because he knew the greatness of this moral achievement, he refuses
not to add a fresh mention at the end of his letter.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xliv-p7">And he calls the collection <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xliv-p7.1">λογίαν</span> (a “contribution,”) immediately from
the very first making out the things to be easy. For when
contribution is made by all together, that becomes light which is
charged upon each.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xliv-p8">But having spoken about the collection, he did not
say immediately, “Let every one of you lay up in store with
himself;” although this of course was the natural consequence;
but having first said, “As I gave order to the Churches of
Galatia,” he added this, kindling their emulation by the account
of the well-doings of others, and putting it in the form of a
narration. And this also he did when writing to the Romans; for
to them also while appearing to narrate the reason why he was going
away to Jerusalem, he introduces thereupon his discourse about
alms; “But now I go unto Jerusalem, ministering unto the
saints: for it hath been the good pleasure of Macedonia and
Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor among the
saints.” (<scripRef passage="Rom. xv. 25" id="iv.xliv-p8.1" parsed="|Rom|15|25|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.15.25">Rom. xv.
25</scripRef>.) Only those he
stimulates by mention of Macedonians and Corinthians; these of
Galatians. For he saith, “As I gave order to the Churches of
Galatia, so also do ye:” for they would surely feel ashamed
ever afterwards to be found inferior to Galatians. And he saith
not, “I advised,” and, “I counselled;” but, “I gave
order,” which is more authoritative. And he doth not bring
forward a single city, or two, or three, but an entire nation: 
which also he doth in his doctrinal instructions, saying, “Even
as also in all the Churches of the saints.” For if this be
potent for conviction of doctrines, much more for imitation of
actions.</p>

“On the first day of the week,” that is, the Lord’s day,
“let each one of you lay by him in store, as he may prosper.”
Mark how he exhorts them even from the time: for indeed the day
was enough to lead them to almsgiving. Wherefore “call to
mind,” saith he, “what ye attained to on this day: how all
the unutterable blessings, and that which is the root and the
beginning of our life took place on this day. But not in this
regard only is the season convenient for a zealous benevolence, but
also because it hath rest and immunity from toils: the souls when
released from labors becoming readier and apter to show pity.
Moreover, the communicating also on that day in Mysteries so
tremendous and immortal instils great zealousness. On it,
accordingly, “let each one of you,” not merely this or that
individual, but “each one of you,” whether poor or rich, woman
or man, slave or free, “lay by him store.” He said not,
“Let him bring it the church,” lest they might feel ashamed
because of the smallness of the sum; but “having by gradual
additions swelled his contribution, let him then produce it, when I
am come but for the present lay it up,” saith he, “at home, and
make thine house a church; thy little box a treasury. Become a
guardian sacred wealth, a self-ordained steward of the poor. Thy
benevolent mind assigns to thee this priesthood.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xliv-p11">Of this our treasury<note place="end" n="334" id="iv.xliv-p11.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xliv-p12"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xliv-p12.1">το γαζοφυλακίον</span>,
Bingham, viii. 7. 11. says, “The Church had her <i>
gazophylacia</i>, or Treasuries, as well as the Temple; which
appears from a Canon of the Fourth Council of Carthage,” (93. <i>
ap. Harduin</i>. i. 984.) “which forbids the offerings of persons
at variance with one another to be received <i>either in the
Treasury or the Sanctuary</i>. So that the Treasury was a
distinct place from the Corban in the Sanctuary.…Here all such
offerings of the people were laid up as were not thought proper to
be brought to the Altar.” He further refers to the <i>
Apostolical Canons</i>, 4 and 5, “That beside Bread and Wine,
nothing should be brought to the Altar, save only new ears of corn
and grapes, and oil for the lamps, and incense for the time of the
oblation. But all other fruits should be sent <span class="Greek" id="iv.xliv-p12.2">εἰς οἷκον</span>, to the Repository, or Treasury it
may be, as first-fruits for the Bishop and Presbyters, and not be
brought to the Altar, but be by them divided among the Bishops and
Clergy.” See Harduin, i. 10.</p></note> even now is a sign: but the sign
remains, the thing itself no where.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xliv-p13">[3.] Now I am aware that many of this congregation
will again find fault with me when I treat of these subjects, and
say, “Be not, I beseech you, be not harsh and disagreeable to
your audience. Make allowances for their disposition; give way to
the mind of the hearers. For in this case you really do put us to
shame; you make us blush.” But I may not endure such words: 
since neither was Paul ashamed to be continually troublesome upon
such points as these and to speak words such as mendicants use. I
grant indeed that if I said, “give it me,” and “lay it up in
my house,” there might perchance be something to be ashamed of in
what I said: hardly however even in that case; for “they who
wait upon the altar,” we read, “have their portion with the
altar.” (c. <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 9.13" id="iv.xliv-p13.1" parsed="|1Cor|9|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.9.13">ix. 13</scripRef>.) However, some one perhaps
might find fault as if he were framing an argument for his own
interest. But now it is for the poor that I make my supplication;
nay, not so much for the poor, as for your sake who bestow the
gift. Wherefore also I am bold to speak out. For what shame is
it to say, Give unto thy Lord in His hunger: Put raiment on Him
going about naked; Receive Him being a stranger? Thy Lord is not
ashamed before the whole world to speak thus: “I was an
hungred, and ye gave Me not to eat,” He who is void of all want
and requires nothing. And am I to be ashamed and hesitate? Away
with this. This shame is of the snare of the devil. I will not
then be ashamed, but will say, and that boldly, “Give <pb n="260" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_260.html" id="iv.xliv-Page_260" />to the needy;” I will say it with a
louder voice than the needy themselves. True it is, if any one
can show and prove that in saying these things we are drawing you
over unto ourselves, and under the pretence of the poor are
ourselves making gain, such a course would be worthy, I say not of
shame, but even of ten thousand thunderbolts; and life itself would
be more than persons so behaving would deserve. If, on the
contrary, by the grace of God, we are in nothing troublesome about
ourselves, but “have made the Gospel without charge” to you;
laboring indeed in no wise like Paul, but being contented with our
own;—with all boldness of speech I will say, “Give unto the
needy:” yea, and I will not leave off saying it, and of those
who give not I will be a severe accuser. For so, if I were a
general and had soldiers, I should not feel ashamed at demanding
food for my men: for I vehemently set my heart upon your
salvation.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xliv-p14">[4.] But that my argument may both be more
forcible and more effective, I will take Paul for my comrade, and
like him will discourse and say, “Let each one of you lay by him
in store, as he may prosper.” Now observe also how he avoids
being burdensome. He said not, “so much,” or “so much,”
but “as he may prosper,” whether much or little. Neither said
he, “what any one may have gained,” but, “as he may
prosper:” signifying that the supply is of God. And not only
so, but also by his not enjoining them to deposit all at once, he
makes his counsel easy: since the gathering little by little
hinders all perception of the burden<note place="end" n="335" id="iv.xliv-p14.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xliv-p15"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xliv-p15.1">λειτουργία</span>.</p></note> and the cost. Here you see the
reason too for his not enjoining them to produce it immediately,
but giving them a long day<note place="end" n="336" id="iv.xliv-p15.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xliv-p16"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xliv-p16.1">πολλὴν τὴν
προθεσμίαν</span>.</p></note>; whereof adding the cause, he
saith, “That there be no gatherings when I come:” which
means, that ye may not when the season is come for paying in
contributions just then be compelled to collect them. And this
too in no ordinary degree encouraged them again: the expectation
of Paul being sure to make them more earnest.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xliv-p19">He said not, “this person,” and
“that,” but, “whomsoever ye shall approve,” whomsoever you
shall choose, thus freeing his ministration from suspicion.
Wherefore to them he leaves the right of voting in the choice of
those who are to convey it. He is far enough from saying, “The
payment is yours, but the privilege of selecting those who are to
carry it is not yours.” Next, that they might not think him
quite absent, he adds his letters, saying, “Whomsoever you
approve, I will send with letters.”<note place="end" n="338" id="iv.xliv-p19.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xliv-p20"> [Chrysostom evidently understood the verse in the
sense found in the margin of the Revised Version. C.]</p></note>  As if he had said, I also will be
with them and share in the ministration, by my letters. And he
said not, “These will I send to bear your alms,” but, “your
bounty;” to signify that they were doing great deeds; to mark
that they were gainers themselves. And elsewhere he calls it both
“a blessing” and “a distribution.” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. ix. 5, 13" id="iv.xliv-p20.1" parsed="|2Cor|9|5|0|0;|2Cor|9|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.9.5 Bible:2Cor.9.13">2 Cor. ix. 5, 13</scripRef>.) The one that he might not
make them less active, the other that he might not elate them.

“And if it be meet for me to go also, they shall go with
me.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xliv-p22">Here again he exhorts them to liberality. As
thus: “if it be so much,” saith he, “as to require my
presence also, neither will I decline this.” But he did not in
the first instance promise this, nor say, “When I am come I will
carry it.” For he would not have made so much of it, if he had
so set it down from the first. Afterwards however he adds it well
and seasonably. Here then you have the reason why he did not
immediately promise, nor yet altogether hold his peace concerning
it: but having said, “I will send,” then at length he adds
himself also. And here too again he leaves it to their own
decision; in saying, “If it be meet for me to go also:”
whereas this rested with them, namely, to make their collection
large; so large even, as to affect his plans and cause him in
person to make the journey.</p>

you,” saith he, “when I shall have passed through
Macedonia.” This he had said also above; then however with
anger: at least he added, (c. <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 4.19" id="iv.xliv-p23.2" parsed="|1Cor|4|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.4.19">iv. 19</scripRef>.) “And I will know not the
speech of them that are puffed up, but the power:” but here,
more mildly; that they might even long for his coming. Then, that
they might not say, “Why is it that you honor the Macedonians
above us?” he said not, “When I depart,” but, “When I shall
have passed through Macedonia; for I do pass through
Macedonia.”</p>

“But with you it may be that I shall abide, or even winter.”
For I do not at all wish to take you merely in my way, but to
continue among you and spend some time. For when he wrote this
letter, he was in Ephesus, and it was winter; as you may know by
his saying, “Until Pentecost I will tarry at Ephesus; but after
this I shall go away to Macedonia, and after having gone through
it, I will be with you in the summer; and perhaps I shall even
spend the winter with you.” And why did he say, “perhaps;”
and did <pb n="261" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_261.html" id="iv.xliv-Page_261" />not positively affirm
it? Because Paul did not foreknow all things; for good
purposes. Wherefore neither doth he absolutely affirm, in order
that if it came not to pass, he might have something to resort to;
first, his previous mention of it having been indefinite; and next,
the power of the Spirit leading him wheresoever It willed, not
where he himself desired. And this also he expresses in the
second Epistle, when excusing himself on account of his delay, and
saying, “Or the things which I purpose, do I purpose according to
the flesh, that with me there should be the yea yea and the nay
nay?” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. i. 17" id="iv.xliv-p24.2" parsed="|2Cor|1|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.1.17">2 Cor. i.

“But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xliv-p29">As we should expect, he tells them all exactly,
informing them as friends. For this too is a mark of friendship

“For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there are
many adversaries.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xliv-p31">Now if it was “great,” how could there be
“adversaries?” Why on this very account the adversaries were
many, because men’s faith was great; because the entrance was
great and wide. But what means, “A great door?” There are
many prepared to receive the faith, many ready to approach and be
converted. There is a spacious entrance for me, things being now
come to that point that the mind of those approaching is at its
prime for the obedience of the faith. On this account, vehement
was the blast of the breath of the devil, because he saw many
turning away from him.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xliv-p32">You see then on both accounts it was needful for him
to stay; both because the gain was abundant, and because the
struggle was great.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xliv-p33">And herewith also he cheered them up, namely, by
saying, that henceforth the word works every where and springs up
readily. And if there be many who plot against it, this also is a
sign of the advance of the Gospel. For at no time doth that evil
demon wax fierce, except on seeing his goods made spoil of
abundantly. (<scripRef passage="Matt. xii" id="iv.xliv-p33.1" parsed="|Matt|12|0|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.12">Matt.
xii</scripRef>.)</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xliv-p34">[6.] Let us then, when we desire to effect any
thing great and noble, not regard this, the greatness of the labor
which it brings, but let us rather look to the gain. Mark, for
instance, Paul, not therefore lingering, not therefore shrinking
back, because “there were many adversaries;” but because
“there was a great door,” pressing on and persevering. Yea,
and as I was saying, this was a sign that the devil was being
stripped, for it is not, depend on it, by little and mean
achievements that men provoke that evil monster to wrath. And so
when thou seest a righteous man performing great and excellent
deeds, yet suffering innumerable ills, marvel not; on the contrary,
one might well marvel, if the devil receiving so many blows were to
keep quiet and bear the wounds meekly. Even as you ought not to
be surprised were a serpent, continually goaded, to grow fierce and
spring on the person that goaded it. Now no serpent steals on you
so fierce as the devil, leaping up against all; and, like a
scorpion with its sting raised, he raises himself upright. Let
not this then disturb you: since of course he that returns from
war and victory and slaughter must needs be bloody, and oftentimes
also have received wounds. Do thou, then, for thy part, when thou
seest any one doing alms and performing numberless other good works
and so curtailing the power of the devil, and then falling into
temptations and perils; be not troubled thereupon. This is the
very reason why he fell into temptations, because he mightily smote
the devil.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xliv-p35">“And how did God permit it?” you will say.
That he might be crowned more signally: that the other might
receive a severer wound. For when after benefits conferred a man
suffers, and that grievously, and yet continually gives thanks, it
is a blow to the devil. For it is a great thing, even when our
affairs are flowing on prosperously, to show mercy and to adhere to
virtue: but it is far greater in grievous calamity not to desist
from this noble occupation; this is he who may be most truly said
to do so for God’s sake. So then, though we be in peril,
beloved, though we suffer ever so greatly, let us with the greater
zeal apply ourselves to our labors for virtue’s sake. For this
is not at all the season for retribution.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xliv-p36">Here then let us not ask for our crowns, lest when
the crowns come in their season, we diminish our recompense. For
as in the case of artificers, they who support themselves and work
receive higher pay; while those who have their maintenance with
their employers, are curtailed in no small part of the wages; so
also in regard to the saints: he that doth immense good and
suffers extreme evil hath his reward unimpaired and a far more
abundant recompense, not only for the good things which he hath
done, but also for the evil which he hath suffered. But he that
enjoys rest and luxury here, hath not 
<pb n="262" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_262.html" id="iv.xliv-Page_262" />such bright crowns there. Let us not then seek
for our recompense here. But “then” of all times let us
rejoice, when doing well we suffer ill. For God hath in store for
us in that world not only the reward of our good deeds, but that of
our temptations also.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xliv-p37">But to explain myself more clearly: suppose two
rich merciful men, and let them give to the poor: then let one
continue in his riches and enjoy all prosperity: the other fall
into poverty and diseases and calamities, and give God thanks.
Now when these are gone away into the other world, which will
receive the greater reward? Is it not quite plain that it will be
he who is sick and in adversity, seeing that though he did well and
suffered ill, he felt not according to human infirmity? I suppose
this is plain to every one. And, in truth, this is the adamantine
statue, this is the considerate servant. (See S. <scripRef passage="Matt. xxv. 21" id="iv.xliv-p37.1" parsed="|Matt|25|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.25.21">Matt. xxv. 21</scripRef>.) But if we ought not to do
any thing good for the hope of the kingdom, but because it so
pleaseth God, which is more than any kingdom; what doth he deserve,
who because he doth not receive his recompense here, is become more
remiss concerning virtue?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xliv-p38">Let us then not be troubled when we see that such an
one who invited widows and made continual feasts lost his house by
fire, or sustained some other such like disaster. Yea, for this
very thing he shall receive his reward. For even Job was not so
much admired for his alms-deeds as he was for his sufferings
afterwards. For this reason his friends also are little esteemed
and deemed of no account; because they sought for the recompenses
of the present world, and with a view to this gave sentence against
the just man. Let us then not seek for our return here; let us
not become poor and needy; since surely it is of extreme meanness,
when heaven is proposed, and things which are above the heaven, to
be looking round on the things which are here. Let us not by any
means do so; but whichsoever of unexpected things come upon us,
hold we fast the commands of God continually, and obey the blessed
Paul.</p>

<p class="c24" id="iv.xlv-p5"><span class="c18" id="iv.xlv-p5.1">Perhaps</span> some one may
think there is something unworthy of Timothy’s courage in this
piece of advice. But not on Timothy’s account is this said, but
for the hearers’ sake: lest by their design against him they
should hurt themselves: since he for his part had his station
always in the way of dangers<note place="end" n="345" id="iv.xlv-p5.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xlv-p6"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xlv-p6.1">πρός κινδύνους ἦν

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlv-p7">“For as a child serveth a father,” saith he,
“so he served with me in furtherance of the Gospel.” (<scripRef passage="Philip. ii. 22" id="iv.xlv-p7.1" parsed="|Phil|2|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Phil.2.22">Philip. ii. 22</scripRef>.) But lest from boldness
towards the disciple they should proceed also to the teacher, and
become worse, he checks them from afar off, saying, “that he may
be with you without fear;” that is, that none of those desperate
persons rise up against him. For he intended perhaps to rebuke
them about the things concerning which Paul also had written: and
indeed Paul professed to send him for this very reason. “For I
have sent Timothy unto you,” saith he, (c. 
<scripRef passage="1 Cor. 4.17" id="iv.xlv-p7.2" parsed="|1Cor|4|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.4.17">iv. 17</scripRef>.) “who shall put you in
remembrance of my ways in Christ even as I teach every where in
every Church.” In order then that they might not through
confidence in their high birth and wealth, and the support of the
people, and the wisdom from without, attack him and spit upon him
and plot against him, being grieved at the reproofs which came from
him; or lest in revenge for the teacher’s rebuke they should
demand satisfaction of him, so punishing the other; therefore he
saith, “that he be without fear with you.” As if he had said,
“Tell me not of those who are without, the Gentiles and
unbelievers. It is your part that I require, you for whom also
the whole Epistle was composed,” the persons also whom in the
beginning and the outset he had frightened. Wherefore he saith,
“with you.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlv-p8">Then in virtue of his ministry he sets him forth as
a person to be fully trusted; saying “For the work of the Lord he
worketh.” That is; “look not,” saith he, “to this, his
not being rich, namely, nor highly educated, nor old: but what
commands are laid upon him, what work he is doing. ‘For the
work of the Lord he worketh.’” And this serves him instead of
all nobility and wealth and age and wisdom.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlv-p9">And he is not content with this, but adds, “Even
as I also.” And some way above, “Who is my beloved son and
faithful in the Lord; he shall put you in remembrance of my ways in
Christ.” Seeing then that he was both young, and had been
singly entrusted with the improvement of so numerous a people, both
of which things tended to bring him into contempt, he adds, as we
might expect,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlv-p10"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 16.11" id="iv.xlv-p10.1" parsed="|1Cor|16|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.16.11">Ver. 11</scripRef>. “Let no one therefore
despise him.” And not this only doth he demand of them, but
also greater honor; wherefore also he saith, “but set him forward
in peace;” that is, without fear; causing no fightings or
contentions, no enmities or hatreds, but rendering all subjection
as to a teacher.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlv-p11">“That he may come unto me: for I expect him with
the brethren.” This also was the language of one that would
alarm them. That is, in order that they might become more
considerate, as knowing that all would be told him whatever
Timothy’s treatment might be, he adds therefore, “for I expect
him.” And besides, hereby he both shows that Timothy is worthy
of their confidence; since being on the point of departing he waits
for him; and also signifies the love which he hath towards them, it
appearing that for their sakes he sent away one so useful to
him.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlv-p12"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 16.12" id="iv.xlv-p12.1" parsed="|1Cor|16|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.16.12">Ver. 12</scripRef>. “But as touching Apollos
the brother, I besought him much to come unto you with the
brethren.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlv-p13">This man appears to have been both well-educated and
also older than Timothy. Lest they should say then, “For what
possible reason did he not send the man grown, but the youth
instead of him?” observe how he softens down this point also,
both calling him a brother, and saying that he had besought him
much. For lest he should seem to have held Timothy in higher
honor than him and to have exalted him more, and on this account
not to have sent him, and cause their envy to burst out more
abundantly, he adds, “I besought him much to come.” What
then: did not the other yield nor con<pb n="264" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_264.html" id="iv.xlv-Page_264" />sent? did he resist and show himself
contentious? He saith not this, but that he might not excite
prejudice against him, and also might make excuse for himself, he
saith, “and it was not at all his will to come now.” Then to
prevent their saying that all this was an excuse and pretence, he
added, “but he will come to you when he shall have
opportunity.” This was both an excuse for him, and a
refreshment to them who desired to see him, by the hope which it
gave of his coming.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlv-p14">[2.] Afterwards indicating that not in the
teachers but in themselves they ought to have their hopes of
salvation, he saith,</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlv-p15"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 16.13" id="iv.xlv-p15.1" parsed="|1Cor|16|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.16.13">Ver. 13</scripRef>. “Watch ye, stand fast in
the faith.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlv-p16">Not in the wisdom which is without: for there it
is not possible to stand, but to be borne along; even as “in the
faith” ye may “stand.” “Quit you like men, be
strong.” “Let all that ye do be done in love.” Now in
saying these things, he seems indeed to advise; but he is
reprimanding them as indolent. Wherefore he saith, “Watch,”
as though they slept; “Stand,” as though they were rocking to
and fro: “Quit you like men,” as though they were playing the
coward: “Let all that ye do be done in love,” as though they
were in dissensions. And the first caution refers to the
deceivers, viz., “Watch,” “stand:” the next, to those who
plot against us, “Quit you like men:” the third, to those who
make parties and endeavor to distract, “Let all that ye do be
done in love;” which thing is “the bond of perfectness,” and
the root and fountain of all blessings.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlv-p17">But what means, “All things in love?”
“Whether any one rebuke,” saith he, “or rule or be ruled, or
learn or teach, let all be in love:” since in fact all the
things which have been mentioned arose from neglect of it. For if
this had not been neglected, they would not have been puffed up,
they would not have said, “I am of Paul, and I of Apollos.”
If this had existed, they would not have gone to law before
heathens, or rather they would not have gone to law at all. If
this had existed, that notorious person would not have taken his
father’s wife: they would not have despised the weak brethren;
there would have been no factions among them; they would not have
been vain-glorious about their gifts. Therefore it is that he
saith, “Let all things be done in love.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlv-p18">[3.] <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 16.15" id="iv.xlv-p18.1" parsed="|1Cor|16|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.16.15">Ver. 15</scripRef>. “Now I beseech you,
brethren;—ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the
first-fruits of Achaia, and that they have set themselves to
minister unto the saints.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlv-p19">In the beginning too he mentions this man, saying,
“I baptized also the home of Stephanas:” and now he speaks of
him as “the first-fruits” not of Corinth only, but also of all
Greece. And this too is no small encomium that he was the first
to come to Christ. Wherefore also in the Epistle to the Romans,
praising certain persons on this account, he said, “Who also were
in Christ before me.” (<scripRef passage="Rom. xvi. 7" id="iv.xlv-p19.1" parsed="|Rom|16|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.16.7">Rom. xvi. 7</scripRef>.) And he said not, that they
were the first who believed, but were the “first-fruits;”
implying that together with their faith they showed forth also a
most excellent life, in every way proving themselves worthy, as in
the case of fruits. For so the first-fruits ought to be better
than the rest of those things whereof they are the first-fruits: 
a kind of praise which Paul hath attributed to these also by this
expression: namely, that they not only had a genuine faith, as I
was saying, but also they exhibited great piety, and the climax of
virtue, and liberality in alms-giving.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlv-p20">And not from hence only, but from another topic
likewise he indicates their piety, i.e., from their having filled
their whole house also with godliness.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlv-p21">And that they flourished in good works also, he
declares by what follows, saying, “They have set themselves to
minister unto the saints.” Hear ye, how vast are the praises of
their hospitality? For he did not say, “they minister,” but,
“have set themselves:” this kind of life they have chosen
altogether, this is their business in which they are always
busy.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlv-p22">“That ye also be in subjection unto such, that is,
“that ye take a share with them both in expenditure of money, and
in personal service: that ye be partakers with them.” For
both to them the labor will be light when they have comrades, and
the results of their active benevolence will extend to more.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlv-p23">And he said not merely, “be fellow-helpers,” but
added, “whatsoever directions they give, obey;” implying the
strictest obedience. And that he might not appear to be favoring
them, he adds, “and to every one that helpeth in the work and
laboreth.” “Let this,” saith he, “be a general rule: 
for I do not speak about them individually, but if there be any one
like them, let him also have the same advantages.” And
therefore when he begins to commend, he calls upon themselves as
witnesses, saying, “I beseech you, ye know the house of
Stephanas.” “For ye also yourselves are aware,” saith he,
“how they labor, and have no need to learn from us.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlv-p24"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 16.17" id="iv.xlv-p24.1" parsed="|1Cor|16|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.16.17">Ver. 17</scripRef>. “But I was glad of the
coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus, for that which was
lacking on your part they supplied.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlv-p25"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 16.18" id="iv.xlv-p25.1" parsed="|1Cor|16|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.16.18">Ver. 18</scripRef>. “For they refreshed my
spirit and yours.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlv-p26">Thus, since it was natural for them to be <pb n="265" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_265.html" id="iv.xlv-Page_265" />greatly irritated against these
persons, for it was they who had come and showed him all about the
division, inasmuch as by them also they had written the questions
about the virgins, and about the married persons:—mark how he
softened them down; both in the beginning of his Epistle by saying,
“For it hath been signified unto me by them which are of the
house of Chloe;” thus at once concealing these and bringing
forward the others: (for it should seem that the latter had given
their information by means of the former:)  and in this place
again, “They have supplied your lack, and refreshed my spirit and
yours:” signifying that they had come instead of all, and had
chosen to undertake so great a journey on their behalf. How then
may this, their peculiar praise, become common? “If you will
solace me for what was wanting on your part by your kindness
towards them; if you will honor, if you will receive, them, if you
will communicate with them in doing good.” Wherefore he saith,
“Acknowledge ye then them that are such.” And while praising
those that came, he embraces also the others in his praise, the
senders together with the sent: where he saith, “‘They
refreshed my spirit and yours, therefore acknowledge such as
these,’ because for your sakes they left country and home.”
Dost thou perceive his consideration? He implies that they had
obliged not Paul only, but the Corinthians likewise, in that they
bore about in themselves the whole city. A thing which both added
credit to them, and did not allow the others to sever themselves
from them, inasmuch as in their persons they had presented
themselves to Paul.</p>

cleave together in one by means of the salutation.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlv-p28">“Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the
Lord;”—for with them he was lodging, being a
tent-maker—“with the Church which is in their house.” This
thing too is no small excellency, that they had made their very
house a Church.</p>

salute you. Salute one another with an holy kiss.” This
addition of the “holy kiss” he makes only<note place="end" n="346" id="iv.xlv-p29.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xlv-p30"> [It seems quite certain that the orator was
incorrectly reported here. For this direction is found in the
Second Epistle (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. 13.12" id="iv.xlv-p30.1" parsed="|2Cor|13|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.13.12">xiii. 12</scripRef>), and also at the close of
First Thessalonians (<scripRef passage="1 Thess. 5.26" id="iv.xlv-p30.2" parsed="|1Thess|5|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Thess.5.26">v. 26</scripRef>) and of Romans (<scripRef passage="Rom. 16.16" id="iv.xlv-p30.3" parsed="|Rom|16|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.16.16">xvi.
16</scripRef>). But his
explication of the meaning is correct. Tertullian (<i>de
Oratione</i>, xviii.) speaks of it as “the kiss of peace,” and
on this account it was eminently fitting that the distracted Church
of Corinth should not omit a salutation so significant. The
qualifying epithet “holy” was added, not as Chrysostom says in
his Homily on the passage in Second Corinthians, in order to
distinguish it from a hollow kiss such as Judas gave to our Lord,
but to denote its religious and Christian character. It was not a
mere expression of domestic kinship and friendliness, but a
recognition of the tender relation existing between each believer
and all the other members of Christ’s mystical person. It
required to be free from deceit and hypocrisy, but it also needed
to be given and received as a pledge of mutual forgiveness and
love, otherwise the whole object of the salutation failed.
C.]</p></note> here. What may the reason be? 
They had been widely at variance with one another on account of
their saying, “I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas,
and I of Christ;” on account of “one being hungry, and another
drunken;” on account of their having contentions and jealousies
and suits. And from the gifts there was much envying and great
pride. Having then knit them together by his exhortation, he
naturally bids them use the holy kiss<note place="end" n="347" id="iv.xlv-p30.4"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xlv-p31"> That is, the kiss of peace, constantly used as part
of the ceremonial of the holy Eucharist; as appears by all the
Primitive Liturgies.</p></note> also as a means of union: for
this unites, and produces one body. This is holy, when free from
deceit and hypocrisy.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlv-p32"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. 16.21" id="iv.xlv-p32.1" parsed="|1Cor|16|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.16.21">Ver. 21</scripRef>. “The salutation of me

with great seriousness; and therefore he added,</p>

Lord Jesus Christ, let him be anathema.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlv-p34">By this one word he strikes fear into all: those
who made their members the members of an harlot; those who put
stumbling blocks in the way of their brethren by the things offered
in sacrifice unto idols; those who named themselves after men;
those who refuse to believe the resurrection. And he not only
strikes fear, but also points out the way of virtue and the
fountain of vice, viz. that as when our love towards Him hath
become intense, there is no kind of sin but is extinguished and
cast out thereby; so when it is too weak, it causes the same to
spring up.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlv-p35">“<i>Maran atha</i>.”<note place="end" n="348" id="iv.xlv-p35.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xlv-p36"> [Chrysostom gives correctly the object of
this solemn utterance. It was surely to strike terror into all
who by contentiousness, by profligacy, by covetousness, by
litigiousness, by idolatry, by arrogance, or in any other way
showed that they were destitute of love to Jesus Christ, our Lord
and Saviour. For such there is no outlook in the future but
perdition. But the answers to the other questions proposed are
not so happy. The use of the East Aramæan term <i>Maran atha</i>
is hardly to be accounted for by supposing that the Apostle wished
to cross the conceit of the Corinthians in their Hellenic language
and wisdom, although it is harsh in Meyer to pronounce this
“singularly absurd.” In the absence of any direct clew to the
purpose it is well to accept the opinion of Calvin that the Apostle
roused by the gravity of the occasion could not satisfy himself
without clothing in the older and more sacred dialect the
tremendous truth which gave such solemn weight to the anathema. A
similar feeling seems to lie at the root of the use of the
corresponding terms, <i>Abba</i> in 
<scripRef passage="Mark xiv. 36, Rom. viii. 15, Gal. iv. 6" id="iv.xlv-p36.1" parsed="|Mark|14|36|0|0;|Rom|8|15|0|0;|Gal|4|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Mark.14.36 Bible:Rom.8.15 Bible:Gal.4.6">Mark xiv. 36, Rom. viii. 15, Gal. iv. 6</scripRef>, (Compare the Hebrew
words <i>Abaddon</i> and <i>Armageddon</i> in the
Apocalypse.)</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlv-p37">So in regard to the meaning of
the words <i>Maran atha</i>. They can just as well bear the
rendering “The Lord cometh” as that which Chrysostom gives,
“The Lord has come” and the connection renders the latter far
more likely, notwithstanding Jerome, Erasmus and Castalio agree
with the Greek Fathers. Hence nearly all modern interpreters hold
that there is a reference to the final Parousia. It is a solemn
warning that the approaching advent of the Son of Man would bring
about the execution of the dreadful curse, just as in the 25th
chapter of Matthew the sentence of the <i>cursed</i> is said to be
announced and put in force when “the Son of Man comes in his
glory and all the angels with him.” The reference to the
incarnation has significance as emphasizing the greatness of the
sin of those who love not the Lord, but the reference to the Second
Advent has much more as it exhibits and enforces the certainty and
severity of the doom that awaits all such sinners. C.]</p></note>  For what reason is this word
used? And wherefore too in the Hebrew-tongue? Seeing that
arrogance was the cause of 
<pb n="266" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_266.html" id="iv.xlv-Page_266" />all the evils, and this arrogance the wisdom from
without produced, and this was the sum and substance of all the
evils, a thing which especially distracted Corinth; in repressing
their arrogance he did not even use the Greek tongue, but the
Hebrew: signifying that so far from being ashamed of that sort of
simplicity, he even embraces it with much warmth.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlv-p38">But what is the meaning of “<i>Maran

he use this phrase in particular? To confirm the doctrine of the

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlv-p43">Thus to hinder them from thinking that in flattery
to them he so ended, he saith, “In Christ Jesus.” It having
nothing in it human or carnal, but being of a sort of spiritual
nature. Wherefore it is thoroughly genuine. For indeed the
expression was that of one who loves deeply. As thus; because he
was separated from them as regards place, as it were by the
stretching out of a right hand he incloses them with the arms of
his love, saying, “My love be with you all;” just as if he
said, “With all of you I am.” Whereby he intimates that the
things written came not of wrath or anger, but of provident care,
seeing that after so heavy an accusation he doth not turn himself
away, but rather loves them, and embraces them when they are afar
off, by these epistles and writings throwing himself into their
arms.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlv-p44">[5.] For so ought he that corrects to do: since
he at least, who acts merely from anger is but satisfying his own
feeling; but he who after correcting the sinner renders also the
offices of love, shows that those words also, whatsoever he spake
in reproof, were words of fond affection. Just so let us too
chasten one another; and let neither the corrector be angry, (for
this belongs not to correction, but to passion,) nor let him that
is corrected take it ill. For what is done is healing, not
despite. Now if physicians use cautery and are not found fault
with, and that too, frequently, though they quite miss their
object; but even in their pain the subjects of the cautery and
amputation esteem as benefactors those who excite this pain; much
more ought he who receives reproof to be so disposed, and as to a
physician so to give heed to the corrector, and not as to an
enemy. And let us also who rebuke approach with great gentleness,
with great prudence. And if thou seest a brother committing sin,
as Christ commanded, make not your rebuke public, but “between
thee and him alone:” (<scripRef passage="Matt. xviii. 15" id="iv.xlv-p44.1" parsed="|Matt|18|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.18.15">Matt. xviii. 15</scripRef>.) not reproaching nor
insulting over him when down, but in pain and with a melting
heart<note place="end" n="350" id="iv.xlv-p44.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xlv-p45"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xlv-p45.1">τηκόμενος</span>.</p></note>. And show
thyself ready also to receive reproof, if thou commit error in any
thing.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlv-p46">Now that what I say may be plainer, let us put
an imaginary case and so try our rule. For God forbid that in
very deed we should be provided with such an illustration of it.
Suppose any brother dwelling in the same house with a virgin, in
honor and chastity, and yet not even so quite escaping evil
report.<note place="end" n="351" id="iv.xlv-p46.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xlv-p47"> St. Chrysostom “attacked in the first instance
those ecclesiastics who, under pretence of charity, lived with
virgins, whom they treated as adopted sisters, who they called
‘subintroductæ’ or <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xlv-p47.1">ἀ</span><span class="Greek" id="iv.xlv-p47.2">δελφαὶ ἀγαπηταί</span>. Their excuses were,
to assist a maiden left desolate without relations or friends; to
take care of her affairs, if rich, and to maintain her in charity,
if poor.…On the other hand, the clergy said they cast on them the
burden of their household, and those trifling cares for which women
are most proper, in order to be more at liberty for the offices of
their ministry. For the rest, they affirmed that in this intimacy
there was no sort of criminal liberty, not at all making the less
profession of continence. So Chrysostom maintained the contrary;
and we have two whole discourses of his on this subject, which seem
to have been written about this time,” the time of his promotion
to the see of Constantinople. Fleury, <i>E. H</i>. b. 20. §.
38.</p></note>  If then
you should hear talk of this their dwelling together, be not
contemptuous, nor say, “Why, hath he no understanding? Doth he
not himself know what is for his good? Get love for nothing, but
do not for nothing get hatred. Why, what have I to do with taking
up a gratuitous enmity?” These are the doting words of wild
beasts, or rather of demons: for it is not so that he is hated
for nothing who doth this for his brother’s correction, rather it
is for great blessings and crowns unutterable.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlv-p48">But if thou sayest, “What? hath he no
understanding?” thou shalt hear from me that he hath not: 
drunken as he is with his passion. For if in the heathen courts
of justice,<note place="end" n="352" id="iv.xlv-p48.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xlv-p49"> The Areopagus, and other courts resembling it,
which allowed no appeals to the passions.</p></note> those who
are injured must not speak for themselves while glowing with wrath;
(although there be no fault in that kind of sympathy;) how much
more those whom evil habit holds in subjection. Wherefore I say
that manifold as his wisdom may be, he hath not his mind awake.
For what can be wiser than David, the man who said, “The dark and
the hidden things of Thy wisdom Thou hast made known unto me?”
(<scripRef passage="Ps. 51.6" id="iv.xlv-p49.1" parsed="|Ps|51|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.51.6">Ps. <pb n="267" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_267.html" id="iv.xlv-Page_267" />li. 6</scripRef>. ap. LXX. l. 6.) But when he
looked on the wife of the soldier with unjust eyes, then according
to what he himself said (<scripRef passage="Ps. cvii. 27" id="iv.xlv-p49.2" parsed="|Ps|107|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.107.27">Ps. cvii. 27</scripRef>.) of those who sail on
the raging sea, “all his wisdom was swallowed up;” and he stood
in need of others to correct him, and did not even perceive amidst
what evils he was. Wherefore also, bewailing his offences, he
said, “As a heavy burden they weighed grievously upon me: my
wounds stank and were corrupt because<note place="end" n="353" id="iv.xlv-p49.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xlv-p50"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xlv-p50.1">ἀπὸ

committeth sin hath no understanding. For he is drunken and is in
darkness. Do not then say these things, neither add that other
remark, “I care not at all about it. ‘For each man shall bear
his own burden.’” (<scripRef passage="Gal. vi. 5" id="iv.xlv-p50.3" parsed="|Gal|6|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gal.6.5">Gal. vi. 5</scripRef>.) Nay, against thyself also
it grows up into a grievous accusation, that seeing one in error
thou dost not restore him. For if it was not right according to
the law of the Jews (<scripRef passage="Exod. xxiii. 4, 5" id="iv.xlv-p50.4" parsed="|Exod|23|4|23|5" osisRef="Bible:Exod.23.4-Exod.23.5">Exod.
xxiii. 4, 5</scripRef>.) to slight
the beast of one’s enemy; he who despises not the beast of burden
nor yet the soul of an enemy perishing, but that of a friend, what
pardon shall he obtain?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlv-p51">Yea, neither is it enough for our excuse that he
hath understanding: since we too after our many and manifold
exhortations have not been sufficient, nor proved useful, unto
ourselves. Bear this in mind then in regard to him also that is
in error; that it is natural he should receive the best counsel
rather from thee than from himself.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlv-p52">And say not, “But what care I about these
things?” Fear thou him who first spoke this word; for the
saying, “Am I my brother’s keeper?” (<scripRef passage="Gen. iv. 9" id="iv.xlv-p52.1" parsed="|Gen|4|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.4.9">Gen. iv. 9</scripRef>.) tends to the same point as
this. This is the mother of all our evils that we esteem the
concerns of our own body as foreign to us. What sayest thou? 
Thou carest not for thy brother? Who then is to care for him? the
unbeliever who rejoices over and reproaches and insults him? or the
devil who urges him on and supplants him?</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlv-p53">And whence comes this? “How do I know that I
shall accomplish anything,” saith he, “though I speak and
advise what is right.” But how is it clear that thou wilt do no
good? Why, this again is extreme folly, while the end remains in
obscurity to incur the manifold blame of confessed indifference.
And yet God who foresees the future often speaks and doth no good;
yet doth He not even so give up; and that, knowing that He shall
not even persuade men. Now if He who knows beforehand that He
shall win no advantage, ceases not from the work of correction,
what excuse wilt thou have, who art completely ignorant of the
future and yet faintest and art benumbed? Yea, and many have
succeeded by frequent attempts: and when they most of all
despaired, then did they most gain their point. And though thou
shouldest gain no advantage, thou hast done thine own part.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlv-p54">Be not then inhuman, nor unmerciful, nor
careless: for that these words come of cruelty and indifference
is plain from what follows: viz. What is the reason that when one
of the members of thy body is in pain, thou sayest not, “What
care I?” Yet whence is it plain, that if it be taken due care
of, it is restored? And yet thou leavest nothing undone, that
even although thou profit not, thou mayest not have to blame
thyself for the omission of any thing which ought to have been
done. Hereupon I ask, are we to take such care for the members of
our body and to neglect those of Christ? Nay, how can such things
deserve pardon? For if I make no impression upon thee by saying,
“Have a care of thine own member;” in order that thou mayest
become better were it only through fear, I put thee in mind of the
body of Christ. But how can it be other than a matter of horror
to see His flesh putrefying, and neglect it? And if thou hadst a
slave or an ass afflicted with a mortifying sore, thou couldest not
have the heart to neglect it: but seest thou the Body of Christ
full of scurvy<note place="end" n="354" id="iv.xlv-p54.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xlv-p55"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xlv-p55.1">ψώρας</span>.</p></note>, and
hurriest by? and thinkest not that such things deserve innumerable
thunder-bolts? For this cause all things are turned upside down,
because of this our inhumanity, because of our indifference.
Wherefore now, I beseech you, let this cruelty be cast out from
among us.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlv-p56">[6.] Draw near to him whom I speak of, as dwelling
with a virgin, and speak some small praise of thy brother, making
it up from the other excellencies which he hath. And foment him
with thy commendations as it were with warm water, and so mitigate
the tumor of his wound. Speak of thyself also as wretched; accuse
the common race of mankind; point out that we are all in sins; ask
for pardon, saying, that thou art undertaking things too great for
thee, but love persuades thee to dare all things. Then in giving
thine advice, do it not imperiously, but in a brotherly way. And
when by all these means thou hast reduced the swelling and soothed
the pain arising from the cutting reproof which is in store for
him, and when thou hast again and again deprecated and besought him
not to be angry: when thou hast bound him down with these things,
then use the knife; neither pressing the matter too close, nor yet
undoing it; that he may neither fly off on the one hand, nor on the
other think little of it. For if thou strike not to the quick
thou hast done no good, and if thy blow be violent, thou makest him
start away.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlv-p57"><pb n="268" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_268.html" id="iv.xlv-Page_268" />Wherefore, even
after all this, being on the very point of the reproof, mix up
again commendation with thy censures. And seeing that this
proceeding considered in itself cannot be matter of praise, (for it
is not commendable to keep house with a damsel that is a virgin;)
let the purpose of him who doth so be thy topic for effecting this;
and say, “I know indeed that thou doest it for God’s sake, and
that the desolation and unprotected state of that poor woman met
thine eye, and caused thee to stretch out thine hand to her.”
And although he may not be doing it with this intention, do thou
speak so; and after this add what follows also; again excusing
thyself and saying, “These things I speak not to direct but to
remind thee. Thou doest it for God’s sake; I too know that.
But let us see whether another evil be not produced thereby. And
if there be none, keep her in thine house, and cling to this
excellent purpose. There is no one to hinder thee. But if any
mischief arise from hence exceeding the advantage, let us take
care, I beseech you, lest while we are earnest to comfort one soul,
we put a stumbling-block in the way of ten thousand.” And do
not add immediately the punishments due to those who give offence,
but take his own testimony also, saying, “Thou hast no need to
learn these things from me: thou thyself knowest, ‘if any one
offend one of these little ones,’ how great a penalty is
threatened. And thus, having sweetened thy speech and smoothed
down his wrath, apply the medicine of thy correction. And should
he again urge her forlorn condition, do not thou even so expose his
pretence, but say to him, “Let nothing of this sort make you
afraid: thou wilt have an ample plea, the offence given to
others: since not for indifference, but in care towards them,
didst thou cease from this thy purpose.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlv-p58">And let the matter of thine advice be brief, for
there is no need of much teaching; but let the expressions of
forbearance on the other hand be many and close upon one another.
And continually have thou recourse to the topic of love; throwing
into shade the painfulness of what thou sayest, and giving him his
full power, and saying, “This is what I for my part advise and
recommend; but about taking the advice thou art only judge: for I
do not compel and force thee, but submit the whole thing to thine
own discretion.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlv-p59">If we so manage our reproof, we shall easily be able
in correct those in error: even as what we now do is surely more
like the conduct of wild beasts or irrational creatures than of
men. For if any persons now perceive any one committing errors of
this kind, with the person himself they do not at all confer, but
themselves, like silly old women who have drunk too much, whisper
with another. And the saying, “Get love for nothing, but do not
get hatred for nothing,” hath not here any place in their
opinion. But, when they have a fancy to speak evil, they mind not
being “hated for nothing,” rather I should say, “being
punished;” since it is not hatred alone that is hereby produced,
but also punishment. But when there is need of correction, they
allege both this, and innumerable other pretexts. Whereas then
would be the time to think of these things, when thou speakest
evil, when thou calumniatest; I mean the saying, “Be not hated
for nothing,” and “I can do nothing,” and “it is no care of
mine.” But as things are, in the former case, thou art
vehemently and idly curious, and carest not for hatred and ills
innumerable; but when thou shouldest be taking thought for the
salvation of thy brother, then it is thy pleasure to be a sort of
unofficious, inoffensive person. And yet from evil speaking
arises hatred both on God’s part and on men’s; and this is no
great care to thee: but by giving advice privately, and reproofs
of that kind, both he and God will be made thy friends. And even
should he hate thee, God goes on loving thee the rather on this
account. Nay, in fact, not even so will he hate thee, as when his
hatred came from thine evil speaking: but in that case he will
avoid thee as a foe and an enemy, whereas now he will consider thee
more venerable than any father. And if he apparently take it ill,
inwardly and privately he will feel much obliged to thee.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlv-p60">[7.] Bearing in mind these things therefore
let us have a care of our own members, and not sharpen the tongue
against one another, nor speak words “which may do hurt,<note place="end" n="355" id="iv.xlv-p60.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xlv-p61"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.xlv-p61.1">ῥ</span><span class="Greek" id="iv.xlv-p61.2">ήματα

swallowing up in the sea;” i.e., as St. Augustin on the place
intimates, “words so sinful that they plunge the swimmer again in
the deep, and complete his shipwreck, when by repentance he ought
to lay hold of the cross.”</p></note>”
undermining the fame of our neighbor, and as in war and battle,
giving and receiving blows. For what after all is the good of
fasting or watching, when the tongue is drunken, and feasts itself
at a table more unclean than of dog’s flesh; when it is grown
ravening after blood, and pours out filth, and makes the mouth a
channel of a sewer, nay rather something more abominable than
that? For that which proceeds from thence pollutes the body: 
but what comes from the tongue often suffocates the
soul.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlv-p62">These things I say, not in anxiety about those who
have an ill report falsely: for they are worthy even of crowns,
when they bear what is said nobly; but in anxiety for you that so
speak. For him that is evil reported of falsely, the Scriptures
pronounce “blessed;” but the evil-speaker they expel from the
holy Mysteries, nay even from the very precincts. For it is <pb n="269" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_269.html" id="iv.xlv-Page_269" />said, (<scripRef passage="Ps. ci. 5" id="iv.xlv-p62.1" parsed="|Ps|101|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.101.5">Ps. ci. 5</scripRef>.) “Him that privily speaketh
against his neighbor, this man did I chase out.” And he saith
too that such a one is unworthy to read the sacred books. For,
“Why,” saith He, (<scripRef passage="Ps. l. 16" id="iv.xlv-p62.2" parsed="|Ps|50|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.50.16">Ps.
l. 16</scripRef>.) “dost thou
declare My righteous laws, and takest My covenant in thy
mouth?” Then, annexing the cause He saith (<scripRef passage="Psa. 50.20" id="iv.xlv-p62.3" parsed="|Ps|50|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.50.20">v. 20</scripRef>.) “Thou satest and spakest
against thy brother.” And here indeed he doth not distinctly
add whether they be things true or false which he speaks. But
elsewhere this too makes part of His prohibition: He implying,
that even though thou speak truths, yet such things are not to be
uttered by thee. For, “Judge not,” saith He,” that ye be
not judged:” (<scripRef passage="Matt. vii. 1" id="iv.xlv-p62.4" parsed="|Matt|7|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.7.1">Matt.
vii. 1</scripRef>.) since he too who
spoke evil of the publican was condemned, although it was true
which he laid to his neighbor’s charge.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlv-p63">“What then,” you will say, “if any one be
daring and polluted, must we not correct him? must we not expose
him?” We must both expose and correct: but in the way which I
mentioned before. But if thou do it upbraiding him, take heed
lest thine imitation of that Pharisee cause thee to fall into his
state. For no advantage accrues from hence; none to thee who
speakest, none to him who hears thee, none to the person accused.
But the latter, for his part, becomes more reckless: since as
long as he is unobserved, he is sensible of shame; but as soon as
he becomes manifest and notorious, he casts off the curb also which
that feeling imposed on him.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlv-p64">And the hearer will in his turn be yet more
injured. For whether he be conscious to himself of good deeds, he
becomes puffed and swoln up with the accusation brought against
another; or of faults, he then becomes more eager for iniquity.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlv-p65">Thirdly, the speaker too himself will both incur the
bad opinion of the hearer, and will provoke God to more anger
against himself.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlv-p66">Wherefore, I beseech you, let us cast from us every
word that is unsavory. If there be any thing good unto
edification, this let us speak.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlv-p67">But hast thou a fancy to avenge thyself on the other
person? Why then punish thyself instead of him? Nay, do thou,
who art so earnestly seeking redress from those who have annoyed
thee, avenge thyself as Paul recommended to take vengeance. “If
thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink.”
(<scripRef passage="Rom. xii. 20" id="iv.xlv-p67.1" parsed="|Rom|12|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.12.20">Rom. xii. 20</scripRef>.) But if thou do not so, but
only plot against him, thou pointest the sword against thyself.</p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlv-p68">Wherefore if that other speak evil, answer him
with praises and commendations. For so wilt thou be able both to
take vengeance on him, and wilt deliver thyself from evil
surmising. Since he that feels pain at hearing ill of himself, is
thought to be so affected because of some consciousness of evil: 
but he that laughs to scorn what is said, exhibits a most
unquestionable token of his not being conscious to himself of any
evil thing.<note place="end" n="356" id="iv.xlv-p68.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.xlv-p69"> [It is impossible to read this Homily without being

Nowhere in the literature that preceded or followed him is to be

deeply in the Spirit of the Master to be able to set forth a
difficult and delicate obligation in such a wise and winning
form. Nothing is overlooked, nothing carelessly stated. C.]</p></note></p>

<p class="c19" id="iv.xlv-p70">Seeing then that thou profitest neither thine
hearer, nor thyself, nor him that is accused, and dost but point

thought of the kingdom of heaven, and of what pleases God: but
since thou art of grosser disposition and bitest like a wild beast,
hereby even be thou instructed; that these arguments having
corrected thee, thou mayest be able to order thyself simply from
consideration of what pleases God; and having come to be above
every passion, mayest obtain the heavenly blessings:—which may
God grant us all to obtain, through the grace of our Lord Jesus
Christ, and His mercy towards mankind; with Whom, to the Father and

with you;” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. xvi. 5, 6" id="v.i-p12.2" parsed="|1Cor|16|5|16|6" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.16.5-1Cor.16.6">1 Cor. xvi.
5, 6</scripRef>.) yet now
after along interval, he came not; but was still lingering and
delaying even though the time appointed had passed away; the Spirit
detaining him in other matters of far greater necessity than
these. For this reason he had need to write a second Epistle,
which he had not needed had he but a little out-tarried his time.<note place="end" n="357" id="v.i-p12.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.i-p13"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.i-p13.1">εἰ παρὰ μικρὸν

<p class="c19" id="v.i-p14">But not for this reason only, but also because they
were amended by the former; for him that had committed fornication
whom before they applauded and were puffed up about, they had cut
off and separated altogether. And this he shows where he says,
“But if any hath caused sorrow, he hath caused sorrow not to me,
but in part (that I press not too heavily) to you all. Sufficient
to such a one is this punishment which was inflicted by the
many.” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. ii. 5, 6" id="v.i-p14.1" parsed="|2Cor|2|5|2|6" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.2.5-2Cor.2.6">2 Cor. ii. 5,
6</scripRef>.) And as he proceeds,
he alludes again to the same thing when he says, “For behold that
ye were made sorry after a godly sort, what earnest care it wrought
in you, yea, what clearing of yourselves, yea, what indignation,
yea, what fear, yea, what longing, yea, what zeal, yea, what
avenging!  In every thing ye approved yourselves to be pure in
this matter.” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. vii. 11" id="v.i-p14.2" parsed="|2Cor|7|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.7.11">2 Cor.

Moreover, the collection<note place="end" n="358" id="v.i-p14.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.i-p15"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.i-p15.1">λογίαν</span>, Ben. <span class="Greek" id="v.i-p15.2">εὐλογίαν</span>, <i>bounty</i>, as <scripRef passage="2 Cor. ix. 5" id="v.i-p15.3" parsed="|2Cor|9|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.9.5">2 Cor. ix. 5</scripRef>. Engl. Vers.</p></note> which he enjoined, they gathered
with much forwardness. Wherefore also he says, “For I know your
readiness of which I glory on your behalf to them of Macedonia,
that Achaia hath been prepared for a year past.” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. ix. 2" id="v.i-p15.4" parsed="|2Cor|9|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.9.2">2 Cor. ix. 2</scripRef>.) And Titus too, whom he
sent, they received with all kindness, as he shows when he says
again, “His inward affection is more abundantly toward you,
whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and
trembling ye received him.” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. vii. 15" id="v.i-p15.5" parsed="|2Cor|7|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.7.15">2 Cor. vii. 15</scripRef>.) For all these reasons he
writes the second Epistle. For it was right 
<pb n="272" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_272.html" id="v.i-Page_272" />that, as when they were in fault he rebuked
them, so upon their amendment he should approve and commend them.
On which account the Epistle is not very severe<note place="end" n="359" id="v.i-p15.6"><p class="endnote" id="v.i-p16"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.i-p16.1">καταφορικωτέρα</span>.</p></note> throughout, but only in a few parts
towards the end. For there were even amongst them Jews who
thought highly of themselves, and accused Paul as being a boaster
and worthy of no regard; whence also that speech of theirs; “His
letters are weighty, but his bodily presence is weak, and his
speech of no account:” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. x. 10" id="v.i-p16.2" parsed="|2Cor|10|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.10.10">2 Cor. x. 10</scripRef>.) meaning thereby, when he is
present he appears of no account, (for this is the meaning of,
“his bodily presence is weak,”) but when he is away he boasts
greatly in what he writes, (for such is the signification of “his
letters are weighty.”)  Moreover, to enhance their own credit
these persons made a pretence of receiving nothing, to which he
also alludes where he says, “that wherein they glory, they may be
found even as we.” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. xi. 12" id="v.i-p16.3" parsed="|2Cor|11|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.11.12">2
Cor. xi. 12</scripRef>.) And
besides, possessing also the power of language, they were forthwith
greatly elated. Wherefore also he calls himself “rude in
speech,” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. xi. 6" id="v.i-p16.4" parsed="|2Cor|11|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.11.6">2 Cor. xi.

is not ashamed thereof; nor deems the contrary any great
acquisition. Seeing then it was likely that by these persons some
would be seduced, after commending what was right in their conduct,
and beating down their senseless<note place="end" n="360" id="v.i-p16.5"><p class="endnote" id="v.i-p17"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.i-p17.1">ἀ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.i-p17.2">πόνοιαν</span>.</p></note> pride in the things of Judaism, in

also.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.i-p19">[2.] Such then, to speak summarily and by the way,
appears to me the argument of this Epistle. It remains to
consider the introduction, and to say why after his accustomed
salutation he begins, as he does, with the mercies of God. But
first, it is necessary to speak of the very beginning, and inquire
why he here associates Timothy with himself. For, he saith,
“Paul an Apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and
Timothy our brother.” In the first Epistle he promised he would
send him; and charged them, saying, “Now if Timothy come, see
that he be with you without fear.” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. xvi. 10" id="v.i-p19.1" parsed="|1Cor|16|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.16.10">1 Cor. xvi. 10</scripRef>.) How then is it that he
associates him here in the outset with himself? After he had been
amongst them, agreeably to that promise of his teacher, “I have
sent unto you Timothy who shall put you in remembrance of my ways
which be in Christ,” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. iv. 17" id="v.i-p19.2" parsed="|1Cor|4|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.4.17">1
Cor. iv. 17</scripRef>.) and had set
everything in order, he had returned back to Paul; who on sending
him, had said, “Set him forward on his journey in peace that he
may come to me, for I expect him with the brethren.” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. xvi. 11" id="v.i-p19.3" parsed="|1Cor|16|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.16.11">1 Cor. xvi. 11</scripRef>.)</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.i-p20">Since then Timothy was restored to his teacher, and
after having with him set in order the things in Asia, (for, says
he, “I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost,” <scripRef passage="1 Cor. xvi. 8" id="v.i-p20.1" parsed="|1Cor|16|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.16.8">1 Cor. xvi. 8</scripRef>;) had crossed again into
Macedonia; Paul not unreasonably associates him hereafter as
abiding with himself. For then he wrote from Asia, but now from
Macedonia. Moreover, thus associating him he at once gains
increased respect for him, and displays his own exceeding
humility<note place="end" n="362" id="v.i-p20.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.i-p21"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.i-p21.1">σεμνότερον ποιῶν</span>.</p></note>: for
Timothy was very inferior to himself, yet doth love bring all
things together. Whence also he everywhere makes him equal with
himself; at one time saying, “as a child serveth a father so he
served with me;” (<scripRef passage="Philip. ii. 22" id="v.i-p21.2" parsed="|Phil|2|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Phil.2.22">Philip. ii. 22</scripRef>.) at another, “for he
worketh the work of the Lord, as I also do;” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. xvi. 10" id="v.i-p21.3" parsed="|1Cor|16|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.16.10">1 Cor. xvi. 10</scripRef>.) and here, he even calleth
him, “brother;” by all making him an object of respect to the
Corinthians amongst whom he had been, as I have said, and given
proof of his worth.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.i-p22">“To the Church of God which is at Corinth.”
Again he calleth them “the Church,” to bring and bind them all
together in one. For it could not be one Church, while those
within her were sundered and stood apart. “With all the saints
which are in the whole of Achaia. In thus saluting all through
the Epistle addressed to the Corinthians, he would at once honor
these, and bring together the whole nation. But he calls them
“saints,” thereby implying that if any be an impure person, he
hath no share in this salutation. But why, writing to the mother
city, does he address all through her, since he doth not so
everywhere? For instance, in his Epistle to the Thessalonians he
addressed not the Macedonians also; and in like manner in that to
the Ephesians he doth not include all Asia; neither was that to the
Romans written to those also who dwell in Italy. But in this
Epistle he doth so; and in that to the Galatians. For there also
he writeth not to one city, or two, or three, but to all who are
scattered every where, saying, “Paul an Apostle, (not from men
neither through man, but through Jesus Christ, and God the Father,
Who raised Him from the dead,) and all the brethren which are with
me, unto the Churches of Galatia. Grace to you and peace.”
(<scripRef passage="Gal. i. 1-3" id="v.i-p22.1" parsed="|Gal|1|1|1|3" osisRef="Bible:Gal.1.1-Gal.1.3">Gal. i. 1–3</scripRef>.) To the Hebrews also he
writes one Epistle to all collectively; not distinguishing them
into their several cities. What then can be the reason of this? 
Because, as I think, in this case all were involved in one common
disorder, wherefore also he addresses them in common, as needing
one common remedy. For the Galatians were all of them infected.
So too were the Hebrews, and so I think these (Achaians) also.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.i-p23"><pb n="273" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_273.html" id="v.i-Page_273" />[3.] So then
having brought the whole nation together in one, and saluted them
with his accustomed greeting, for, saith he, “Grace to you and
peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. i. 2" id="v.i-p23.1" parsed="|2Cor|1|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.1.2">2 Cor. i. 2</scripRef>.) hear how aptly to the
purpose in hand he begins, “Blessed be the God and Father of our
Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all
comfort.” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. 1.3" id="v.i-p23.2" parsed="|2Cor|1|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.1.3">ver. 3</scripRef>.) Do you ask, how is
this aptly to the purpose in hand? I reply, Very much so; for
observe, they were greatly vexed and troubled that the Apostle had
not come to them, and that, though he had promised, but had spent
the whole time in Macedonia; preferring as it seemed others to
themselves. Setting himself then to meet this feeling<note place="end" n="363" id="v.i-p23.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.i-p24"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.i-p24.1">τὸ ἀνθορμοῦν</span>.</p></note> against him,
he declares the cause of his absence; not however directly stating
it, as thus; “I know, indeed, I promised to come, but since I was
hindered by afflictions forgive me, nor judge me guilty of any sort
of contempt or neglect towards you:” but after another manner
he invests the subject at once with more dignity and
trustworthiness, and gives it greatness by the nature of the
consolation<note place="end" n="364" id="v.i-p24.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.i-p25"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.i-p25.1">ἐ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.i-p25.2">παίρων τῇ παραμυθίᾳ τὸ πρᾶγμα</span>.</p></note>, so that
thereafter they might not so much as ask the reason of his delay.
Just as if one, having promised to come to one he longed for, at
length arriving after dangers innumerable, should say, “Glory to
Thee, O God, for letting me see the sight so longed for of his dear
countenance!  Blessed be Thou, O God, from what perils hast Thou
delivered me!” for such a doxology is an answer to him who was
preparing to find fault, and will not let him so much as complain
of the delay; for one that is thanking God for deliverance from
such great calamities he cannot for shame drag to the bar, and bid
clear himself of loitering. Whence Paul thus begins, “Blessed
be the God of mercies,” implying by the very words that he had
been both brought into and delivered from mighty perils. For as
David also doth not address God every where in one way or with the
same titles; but when he is upon battle and victory, “I will love
Thee, he saith, O Lord my strength; the Lord is my buckler<note place="end" n="365" id="v.i-p25.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.i-p26"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.i-p26.1">ὑ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.i-p26.2">περασπιστὴς</span> Gr.</p></note>:” when
again upon delivery from affliction and the darkness which
overwhelmed him, “The Lord is my light and my salvation;” (<scripRef passage="Ps. xxvii. 1" id="v.i-p26.3" parsed="|Ps|27|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.27.1">Ps.
xxvii. 1</scripRef>.) and as
the immediate occasion suggests, he names Him now from His
loving-kindness, now from His justice, now from His righteous
judgment:—in like way Paul also here at the beginning describeth
Him by His loving-kindness, calling Him “the God of mercies,”
that is, “Who hath showed me so great mercies as to bring me up
from the very gates of death.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.i-p27">And thus to have mercy is the peculiar and excellent
attribute of God, and the most inherent in His nature; whence he
calleth Him the “God of mercies.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.i-p28">And observe, I pray you, herein also the
lowly-mindedness of Paul. For though he were in peril because of
the Gospel he preached; yet saith he not, he was saved for his
merit, but for the mercies of God. But this he afterwards
declareth more clearly, and now goes on to say, “Who comforteth
us in all affliction.” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. i. 4" id="v.i-p28.1" parsed="|2Cor|1|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.1.4">2 Cor. i. 4</scripRef>.) He saith not, “Who
suffereth us not to come into affliction:” but, “Who
comforteth in affliction.” For this at once declareth the power
of God; and increaseth the patience of those afflicted. For,
saith he, “tribulation worketh patience.” (<scripRef passage="Rom. v. 3" id="v.i-p28.2" parsed="|Rom|5|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.5.3">Rom. v. 3</scripRef>.) And so also the prophet,
“Thou hast set me at large when I was in distress.” (<scripRef passage="Ps. iv. 1" id="v.i-p28.3" parsed="|Ps|4|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.4.1">Ps. iv. 1</scripRef>.) He doth not say, “Thou
hast not suffered me to fall into affliction,” nor yet, “Thou
hast quickly removed my affliction,” but, whilst it continueth,
“Thou hast set me at large:” (<scripRef passage="Dan. iii. 21" id="v.i-p28.4" parsed="|Dan|3|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Dan.3.21">Dan. iii. 21</scripRef>. &amp;c.) that is, “hast
granted me much freedom and refreshment.” Which truly happened
also in the case of the three children, for neither did He prevent
their being cast into the flame, nor when so cast, did He quench
it, but while the furnace was burning He gave them liberty. And
such is ever God’s way of dealing; as Paul also implies when he
says, “Who comforteth us in all affliction.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.i-p29">But he teaches something more in these words: Do
you ask what? Namely, that God doeth this not once, nor twice,
but without intermission. For He doth not one while comfort,
another not, but ever and constantly. Wherefore he saith, “Who
comforteth,” not, “Who hath comforted,” and, “in all
affliction,” not, “in this or that,” but, “in all.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.i-p30">“That we may be able to comfort them which
are in any affliction through the comfort wherewith we ourselves
are comforted of God.” See you not how he is beforehand<note place="end" n="366" id="v.i-p30.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.i-p31"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.i-p31.1">προανακρούεται</span>.</p></note> with his
defence by suggesting to the hearer the thought of some great
affliction; and herein also is his modesty again apparent, that he
saith not for their own merits was this mercy showed, but for the
sake of those that need their assistance; “for,” saith he,
“to this end hath He comforted us that we might comfort one
another.” And hereby also he manifesteth the excellency of the
Apostles, shewing that having been comforted and breathed awhile,
he lieth not softly down as we, but goeth on his way to anoint<note place="end" n="367" id="v.i-p31.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.i-p32"> i.e., for the combat.</p></note>, to nerve,
to rouse others. Some, however, consider this as the Apostle’s
meaning. “Our consolation is that of others also:” but my
opinion is that in <pb n="274" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_274.html" id="v.i-Page_274" />this
introduction, he is also censuring the false Apostles, those vain
boasters who sat at home and lived in luxury; but this covertly
and, as it were, incidentally, the leading object being to
apologise for his delay. “For,” [he would say,] “if for
this end we were comforted that we might comfort others also, do
not blame us that we came not; for in this was our whole time
spent, in providing against the conspiracies, the violence, the
terrors which assailed us.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.i-p33">[4.] “For as the sufferings of Christ
abound unto us, even so our comfort also aboundeth through
Christ.” Not to depress the disciples by an aggravated account
of his sufferings; he declareth on the other hand that great and
superabundant was the consolation also, and lifteth up<note place="end" n="368" id="v.i-p33.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.i-p34"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.i-p34.1">ἀ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.i-p34.2">νιστησιν</span>. The word has here probably the
double sense, “raiseth up the depressed,” and “lifteth upward
towards heaven.”</p></note> their heart
not hereby alone, but also by putting them in mind of Christ and
calling the sufferings “His,” and <note place="end" n="369" id="v.i-p34.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.i-p35"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.i-p35.1">πρὸ τῆς
παρακλήσεως</span>.</p></note>prior to the consolation deriveth a
comfort from the very sufferings themselves. For what joy can I
have so great as to be partaker with Christ, and for His sake to
suffer these things? What consolation can equal this? But not
from this source only does he raise the spirits of the afflicted,
but from another also. Ask you what other? In that he saith,
“abound:” for he doth not say, “As the sufferings of
Christ” are “in us,” but as they “abound,” thereby
declaring that they endure not His sufferings only, but even more
than these<note place="end" n="370" id="v.i-p35.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.i-p36"> St. Chrysostom does not, of course, mean, for
an instant, to compare the sufferings of the Apostles with those of
our Lord <i>in themselves</i>, but in one point only, their
number. His sufferings alone were meritorious and well-pleasing
in themselves, their’s in Him only; His turned away the
Father’s wrath, their’s were accepted by Him, when reconciled;
His were spiritual also, their’s bodily only; His were borne by
His own power, through His divinity, their’s not by their own,
but through His indwelling Spirit; but, while of course, beyond all
thought inferior in every other respect, S. Chrysostom infers from
the Apostle’s words, that their bodily sufferings outnumber His,
though these also were, (he insists throughout) not their’s, but
His in these His members, bestowed by Him, borne through Him and
acceptable in Him. The whole comment is a development of the
word <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.i-p36.1">περισσεύει</span> “aboundeth,”
whence he infers that they were “more abundant,” <span class="Greek" id="v.i-p36.2">περισσά</span>: (as, plainly, the bodily
sufferings of the army of Martyrs have been more <i>
numerous</i>.) Yet though true, the statement, if repeated by one
less reverent and not corrected by the vivid consciousness that
these too were His sufferings, would become profane.</p></note>. For,
saith he, “not whatsoever He suffered, that have we suffered;
“but even more<note place="end" n="371" id="v.i-p36.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.i-p37"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.i-p37.1">περισσά, περισσεύει</span>.</p></note>,” for,
consider, “Christ was cast out, persecuted, scourged, died,”
but we, saith he, “more than all this,” which even of itself
were consolation enough. Now let no one condemn this speech of
boldness; for he elsewhere saith, “Now I rejoice in my
sufferings, and fill up on my part that which is lacking of the
afflictions of Christ in my flesh.” (<scripRef passage="Col. i. 24" id="v.i-p37.2" parsed="|Col|1|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Col.1.24">Col. i. 24</scripRef>.) Yet neither here nor there
is it from boldness or any presumptousness. For as they wrought
greater miracles than He according to that saying of His, “he
that believeth on Me shall do greater works than these,” (<scripRef passage="John xiv. 12" id="v.i-p37.3" parsed="|John|14|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.14.12">John xiv. 12</scripRef>.) but all is of Him that
worketh in them; so did they suffer also more than He, but all
again is of Him that comforteth them, and fitteth them to bear the
evils that betide them.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.i-p38">With which respect Paul aware how great a thing he
had said, doth again remarkably restrain it by adding, “So our
comfort also aboundeth through Christ;” thus at once ascribing
all to Him, and proclaiming herein also His loving-kindness; for,
he saith not, “As our affliction, such our consolation;” but
“far more;” for, he saith not, “our comfort is equal to our
sufferings,” but, “our comfort aboundeth,” so that the season
of struggles was the season also of fresh crowns. For, say, what
is equal to being scourged for Christ’s sake and holding converse
with God; and being more than match for all things, and gaining the
better of those who cast us out, and being unconquered by the whole
world, and expecting hence such good things “as eye hath not
seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of
man!” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. ii. 9" id="v.i-p38.1" parsed="|1Cor|2|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.2.9">1 Cor. ii.
9</scripRef>.) And what is equal
to suffering affliction for godliness’ sake, and receiving from
God consolations infinite, and being rescued from sins so great,
and counted worthy of the Spirit, and of being sanctified and
justified, and regarding no man with fear and trembling, and in
peril itself outshining all.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.i-p39">[5.] Let us then not sink down when tempted. For
no self-indulger hath fellowship with Christ, nor sleeper, nor
supine [person], nor any of these lax and dissolute livers. But
Whoso is in affliction and temptation, this man standeth near to
Him, whoso is journeying on the narrow way. For He Himself trode
this; whence too He saith, “the Son of Man hath not where to lay
His head.” So then grieve not when thou art in affliction;
considering with Whom thou hast fellowship, and how thou art
purified by trials; and how great gain is thine. For there is
nothing miserable save the offending against God; but this apart,
neither afflictions nor conspiracies, nor any other thing hath
power to grieve the right-minded soul: but like as a little
spark, if thou cast it into a mighty deep, thou presently puttest
it out, so doth even a total and excessive sorrow if it light on a
good conscience easily die away and disappear.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.i-p40">Such then was the spring of Paul’s continual
joy: because in whatever was of God he was full of hope; and did
not so much as take count of ills so great, but though he grieved
as a man yet sank not. So too was that Patriarch encompassed with
joy in the midst of much painful suffering; for consider, he
forsook his country, underwent journeyings long and hard; when he
came into a strange land, had “not so 
<pb n="275" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_275.html" id="v.i-Page_275" />much as to set his foot on.” (<scripRef passage="Acts vii. 5" id="v.i-p40.1" parsed="|Acts|7|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.7.5">Acts vii. 5</scripRef>.) Then again a famine
awaited him which made him once more a wanderer; after the famine
again came the seizure of his wife, then the fear of death, and
childlessness, and battle, and peril, and conspiracies, and at the
last that crowning trial, the slaying of his only-begotten and
true<note place="end" n="372" id="v.i-p40.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.i-p41"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.i-p41.1">γνησίον</span>, i.e., the son of
the true wife, as opposed to the son of the bondwoman.</p></note> son, that
grievous irreparable [sacrifice.] For think not, I pray you, that
because he readily obeyed, he felt not all the things he
underwent. For though his righteousness had been, as indeed it
was, inestimable<note place="end" n="373" id="v.i-p41.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.i-p42"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.i-p42.1">μυριακὶς δίκαιος</span>.</p></note>, yet was he
a man and felt as nature bade. But yet did none of these things
cast him down, but he stood like a noble athlete, and for each one
was proclaimed and crowned a victor. So also the blessed Paul,
though seeing trials in very snow-showers assailing him daily,
rejoiced and exulted as though in the mid-delights of Paradise.
As then he who is gladdened with this joy cannot be a prey to
despair; so he who maketh not this his own is easily overcome of
all; and is as one that hath unsound armor, and is wounded by even
a common stroke: but not so he who is well encased at all points,
and proof against every shaft that cometh upon him. And truly
stouter than any armor is joy in God; and whoso hath it, nothing
can ever make his head droop or his countenance sad, but he beareth
all things nobly. For what is worse to bear than fire? what more
painful than continual torture? truly it is more overpowering<note place="end" n="374" id="v.i-p42.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.i-p43"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.i-p43.1">τυραννικώτερον</span>.</p></note> in pain than
the loss of untold wealth, of children, of any thing; for, saith
he, “Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his
life.” (<scripRef passage="Job ii. 4" id="v.i-p43.2" parsed="|Job|2|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Job.2.4">Job ii.
4</scripRef>.) So nothing can be
harder to bear than bodily pain; nevertheless, because of this joy
in God, what even to hear of is intolerable, becomes both tolerable
and longed for: and if thou take from the cross or from the
gridiron the martyr yet just breathing, thou wilt find such a
treasure of joy within him as admits not of being told.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.i-p44">[6.] And doth any one say, What am I to do<note place="end" n="375" id="v.i-p44.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.i-p45"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.i-p45.1">τί πάθω</span>.</p></note>; for now is
no time of martyrdom? What sayest thou? Is now no time of
martyrdom? Never is it not a time; but ever is it before our
eyes; if we<note place="end" n="376" id="v.i-p45.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.i-p46"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.i-p46.1">ἐ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.i-p46.2">ὰν νήφωμεν</span>.</p></note> will keep
them open. For it is not the hanging on a cross only that makes a
Martyr, for were this so, then was Job excluded from this crown;
for he neither stood at bar, nor heard Judge’s voice, nor looked
on executioner; no, nor while hanging on tree aloft had his sides
mangled; yet he suffered worse than many martyrs; more sharply than
any stroke did the tale of those successive messengers strike, and
goad him on every side: and keener the gnawings of the worms
which devoured him in every part than thousand
executioners.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.i-p47">Against what martyr then may he not worthily
be set? Surely against ten thousand. For in every kind [of
suffering] he both wrestled and was crowned; in goods, and
children, and person, and wife, and friends, and enemies, and
servants, (for these too even did spit in his face,) in hunger and
visions and pains and noisomeness; it was for this I said he might
worthily be set, not against one nor two nor three, but against ten
thousand Martyrs. For besides what I have mentioned, the time
also maketh a great addition to his crown; in that it was before
the Law, before Grace, he thus suffered, and that, many months, and
each in its worst form; and all these evils assailed him at once.
And yet each individual evil by itself intolerable, even that which
seemeth most tolerable, the loss of his goods. For many have
patiently borne stripes, but could not bear the loss of their
goods; but rather than relinquish any part of them were content
even to be scourged for their sake and suffer countless ills; and
this blow, the loss of goods, appeared to them heavier than all.
So then here is another method of martyrdom for one who bears this
loss nobly. And doth any ask, How shall we bear it nobly? When
thou hast learned that by one word of thanksgiving thou shalt gain
more than all thou hast lost. For if at the tidings of our loss
we be not troubled, but say, “Blessed be God,” we have found
far more abundant riches. For truly such great fruit thou shalt
not reap by expending all thy wealth on the needy, by going about
and seeking out the poor, and scattering thy substance to the
hungry, as thou shalt gain by the same word. And so neither Job
do I admire so much in setting wide his house to the needy, as I am
struck with and extol his taking the spoiling of his substance
thankfully. The same in the loss of children it happeneth to
see. For herein, also, reward no less than his who offered<note place="end" n="377" id="v.i-p47.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.i-p48"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.i-p48.1">ἀ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.i-p48.2">ναγαγόντος</span>, see

presented him in sacrifice shalt thou receive, if as thou seest

lose in that the child is lying dead here. And besides, he had
some comfort in the prospect of a good work done, and the thought
that this so excellent achievement was the work of his own
fortitude, and that the voice he heard came from above made him the
readier. But here is <pb n="276" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_276.html" id="v.i-Page_276" />no
such thing. So that he had need have a soul of adamant, who can

affluence, in the dawn<note place="end" n="378" id="v.i-p48.5"><p class="endnote" id="v.i-p49"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.i-p49.1">ὑ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.i-p49.2">ποφαίνοντα</span>.</p></note> of fair promise, lying upon the

outstretched corpse. And should such an one, hushing to rest the
heavings of nature, be strengthened to say the words of Job without
a tear, “The Lord gave, the Lord hath taken away;”
(<scripRef passage="Job i. 21" id="v.i-p50.3" parsed="|Job|1|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Job.1.21">Job i. 21</scripRef>.) for those words’ sake
alone, he shall stand with Abraham himself and with Job be
proclaimed a victor. And if, staying the wailings of the women
and breaking up the bands of mourners, he shall rouse them all to
sing glory [to God], he shall receive above, below, rewards
unnumbered; men admiring, angels applauding, God crowning him.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.i-p51">[7.] And sayest thou, How is it possible for one
that is man not to mourn? I reply, If thou wilt reflect how
neither the Patriarch nor Job, who both were men, gave way to any
thing of the kind; and this too in either case before the Law, and
Grace, and the excellent wisdom of the laws [we have]: if thou
wilt account that the deceased has removed into a better country,
and bounded away to a happier inheritance, and that thou hast not
lost thy son but bestowed him henceforward in an inviolable spot.
Say not then, I pray thee, I am no longer called “father,” for
why art thou no longer called so, when thy son abideth? For
surely thou didst not part with thy child nor lose thy son? 
Rather thou hast gotten him, and hast him in greater safety.
Wherefore, no longer shalt thou be called “father” here only,
but also in heaven; so that thou hast not lost the title
“father,” but hast gained it in a nobler sense; for henceforth
thou shalt be called father not of a mortal child, but of an
immortal; of a noble soldier; on duty continually within [the
palace]. For think not because he is not present that therefore
he is lost; for had he been absent in a foreign land, the title of
thy relationship had not gone from thee with his body. Do not
then gaze on the countenance of what lieth there, for so thou dost
but kindle afresh thy grief; but away with thy thought from him
that lieth there, up to heaven. That is not thy child which is
lying there, but he who hath flown away and sprung aloft into
boundless height. When then thou seest the eyes closed, the lips
locked together, the body motionless, Oh be not these thy thoughts,
“These lips no longer speak, these eyes no longer see, these feet
no longer walk, but are all on their way to corruption!” Oh say
not so: but say the reverse of this, “These lips shall speak
better, and the eyes see greater things, and the feet shall mount
upon the clouds; and this body which now rotteth away shall put on
immortality, and I shall receive my son back more glorious. But
if what thou seest distress thee, say to thyself the while, This is
[only] clothing and he has put it off to receive it back more
precious; this is an house and it is taken down to be restored in
greater splendor. For like as we, when purposing to take houses
down, allow not the inmates to stay, that they may escape the dust
and noise; but causing them to remove a little while, when we have
built up the tenement securely, admit them freely; so also doth
God; Who taking down this His decaying tabernacle hath received him
the while into His paternal dwelling and unto Himself, that when it
hath been taken down and built anew He may then return it to him
more glorious.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.i-p52">Say not then, “He is perished and shall no
more be;” for these be the words of unbelievers; but say, “He
sleepeth and will rise again,” “He is gone a journey and will

there seek him where the King is, where is the army of the Angels;
not in the grave; not in the earth; lest whilst he is so highly
exalted, thyself remain grovelling on the ground.</p>

round to himself alone, see how he maketh them too to share these
praises. For to the words, “Whether we be afflicted, it is for
your comfort and salvation:” he adds, “which worketh in the
patient enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer.”
(<scripRef passage="2 Cor. 1.7" id="v.ii-p7.2" parsed="|2Cor|1|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.1.7">ver. 7</scripRef>.) Afterwards, indeed,
he states this more clearly, thus saying, “As ye are partakers of
the sufferings, so also are ye of the consolation;” but here also
meanwhile he alludes to it in the words, “the same sufferings,”
so making<note place="end" n="384" id="v.ii-p7.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii-p8"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.ii-p8.1">κοινώσας τὸν λόγον</span>.</p></note> what he says

our work alone, but your own as well; for both we in preaching to
you the word endure affliction, and ye in receiving it endure the
very same; we to impart to you that which we received, ye to
receive what is imparted and not to let it go.” Now what
humility can compare with this, seeing that those who fell so far
short of him he raiseth to the same dignity of endurance? for he
saith, “Which worked in the enduring of the same sufferings;”
for not through believing only cometh your salvation, but also
through the suffering and enduring the same things with us. For

<p class="c19" id="v.ii-p19">That for their sakes the Apostles were

that for their sakes also they were comforted. He said this
indeed even a little above, although somewhat generally<note place="end" n="392" id="v.ii-p19.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii-p20"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.ii-p20.1">ἀ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.ii-p20.2">διορίστως</span> <scripRef passage="2 Cor. 1.4" id="v.ii-p20.3" parsed="|2Cor|1|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.1.4">ver. 4</scripRef>.</p></note>, thus;
“Blessed be God, Who comforteth us in all our afflictions, that
we may be able to comfort them which are in any affliction.” He

their needs. “For whether we be comforted,” says he, “it is
for your comfort.” What he means is this; our comfort becometh
your refreshment, even though we should not comfort you by word.
If we be but a little refreshed, this availeth for encouragement to
you; and if we be ourselves comforted, this becometh your
comfort. For as ye consider our sufferings your own, so do ye
also make our comfort your own. For surely it cannot be that,
when ye share in worse fortune with us, ye will not share in the
better. If then ye share in everything, as in tribulation so in
comfort, ye will in no wise blame us for this delay and slowness in
coming, because that both for your sakes we are in tribulation and
for your sakes in comfort. For lest any should think this a hard
saying, “for your sakes we thus suffer,” he adds, “for your
sakes also we are comforted,” and “not we alone are in peril;
for ye also,” saith he, “are partakers of the same
sufferings.” Thus then, by admitting them to be partakers in
the perils and ascribing to them the cause of their own comfort, he
softeneth what he saith. If then we be beset by craft<note place="end" n="394" id="v.ii-p21.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii-p22"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.ii-p22.1">ἐ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.ii-p22.2">πιβουλευώμεθα</span>.</p></note>, be of good

that which they<note place="end" n="396" id="v.ii-p23.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii-p24"> Ben. <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.ii-p24.1">ἐ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.ii-p24.2">καρποῦτο</span>.</p></note> enjoyed not
only from being comforted by themselves, (the Apostles) but also
from knowing them (the Apostles) to be at rest, hear him declaring
in what follows next, “Knowing that as ye are partakers of the
sufferings, so also are ye of the comfort.” For as when we
suffer persecution, ye are in distress as though yourselves so
suffering; so are we sure that when we are comforted, ye think the
enjoyment also your own. What more humble-minded than this

<p class="c19" id="v.ii-p28">“These things we speak,” saith he, “that ye
may not be ignorant of what befell us; for we wish, yea have
earnestly endeavored, that ye should know our affairs:” which
is a very high proof of love. Of this even in the former Epistle
he had before given notice, where he said, “For a great door and
effectual is opened to me at Ephesus, and there are many
adversaries.” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. xvi. 8, 9" id="v.ii-p28.1" parsed="|1Cor|16|8|16|9" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.16.8-1Cor.16.9">1 Cor.
xvi. 8, 9</scripRef>.) Putting
them then in mind of this, and recounting how much he suffered, he
saith, “I would not have you ignorant of our affliction which
befell us in Asia.” And in his Epistle to the Ephesians too he
said the same. For having sent Tychicus to them, he gives this as
the reason of his journey: whence he saith, “But that ye also
may know my affairs, and how I do, Tychicus, the beloved brother
and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all
things; whom I have sent unto you for this very purpose, that ye
may know our state, and that he may comfort your hearts.”
(<scripRef passage="Eph. vi. 21, 22" id="v.ii-p28.2" parsed="|Eph|6|21|6|22" osisRef="Bible:Eph.6.21-Eph.6.22">Eph. vi. 21, 22</scripRef>.) And in other Epistles also
he doeth the very same. Nor is it superfluous, but even
exceedingly necessary: both because of his exceeding affection
for the disciples, and because of their continued trials; wherein
the knowledge of each other’s fortunes was a very great comfort;
so that if these were calamitous, they might be prepared both to be
energetic and to be safer against falling; or if these were good,
they might rejoice with them. He here, however, speaketh as well
of being delivered from trials as of being assaulted by them,
saying, “We were weighed down exceedingly, beyond <pb n="279" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_279.html" id="v.ii-Page_279" />our power.” Like a vessel
sinking<note place="end" n="398" id="v.ii-p28.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii-p29"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.ii-p29.1">βαπτιζόμενον</span>.</p></note> under some
mighty burden. He may seem to have said, only one thing here
“exceedingly” and “beyond our power:” it is, however, not
one but two; for lest one should object, “What then? granting the
peril were exceeding, yet it was not great to you;” he added, it
both was great and surpassed our strength, yea, so surpassed it,
“That we despaired even of life.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.ii-p30">That is, we had no longer any expectation of
living. What David calleth “the gates of hell, the pangs” and
“the shadow of death,” this he expresseth by saying, “We
endured peril pregnant with certain death.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.ii-p31"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 1.9" id="v.ii-p31.1" parsed="|2Cor|1|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.1.9">Ver. 9</scripRef>.
“But we had the answer of death in ourselves, that we should not
trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.ii-p32">What is this, “the answer of death?”<note place="end" n="399" id="v.ii-p32.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii-p33"> [This is the rendering of <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.ii-p33.1"> ἀπόκριμα</span> in the Revised Version,
but the American Committee prefer to retain “sentence” of the
common version, adding in the margin “Gr. answer.” But it
seems better to adhere to the view of the British Revisers, since
this is the natural meaning of the term, (Prof. Thayer in his
edition of Grimm gives no other), and besides, adds greatly to the
vivacity of the Apostle’s utterance. Again and again he was
compelled to ask the question what would be the end of the perils
by which he was surrounded, but the answer invariably was Death.
This being the case he was permanently driven out of any
self-trust, and compelled to rely upon God “who raiseth the
dead,” and who therefore could easily deliver his servants even
when at the point to die. It is true that there is no such thing
as implicit confidence in God until men renounce all confidence in
themselves.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.ii-p34">There are different opinions as to
the nature of the terrible peril to which the Apostle was exposed
in Asia. Some have suggested the uproar in Ephesus mentioned in
<scripRef passage="Acts xix. 23-41" id="v.ii-p34.1" parsed="|Acts|19|23|19|41" osisRef="Bible:Acts.19.23-Acts.19.41">Acts xix. 23–41</scripRef>, others a severe
illness, others a dangerous shipwreck, others (Rev. Jos. Waite in
<i>Bible Commentary</i>) his devouring anxiety about Corinthian
affairs. It does not seem necessary to be able to determine this
matter precisely. The probability is that he refers to trials of
different kinds, and especially to plots and attempts against his
life. He could hardly use stronger language than he does to set
forth the desperate straits in which he was. “Weighed down
exceedingly,” “beyond our power,” “we despaired even of
life.” Chrysostom well points out and enforces the lessons to
be drawn from the extraordinary experience of this eminent servant
of God. C.]</p></note>  The vote,
the judgment, the expectation. For so spake our affairs; our
fortunes gave this answer, “We shall surely die.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.ii-p35">To be sure, this did not come to the proof,
but only as far as to our anticipations, and stopped there: for
the nature of our affairs did so declare, yet the power of God
allowed not the declaration to take effect, but permitted it to
happen only in our thought and in expectation: wherefore he
saith, “We had the answer of death in ourselves,” not in
fact.<note place="end" n="400" id="v.ii-p35.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii-p36"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.ii-p36.1">τῇ πείρᾳ</span>.</p></note>  And
wherefore permitted He peril so great as to take away our hope and
cause us to despair? “That we should not trust in ourselves,”
saith he, “but in God.” These words Paul said, not that this
was his own temper. Away with such a thought, but as attuning<note place="end" n="401" id="v.ii-p36.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii-p37"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.ii-p37.1">ῤ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.ii-p37.2">υθμιζων</span>.</p></note> the rest by
what he saith of himself, and in his great care to speak
modestly. Whence also further on he saith, “There was given to
me a thorn in the flesh, (meaning his trials,) lest I should be
exalted overmuch.” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. xii. 7" id="v.ii-p37.3" parsed="|2Cor|12|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.12.7">2 Cor. xii. 7</scripRef>.) And yet God doth not say
that He permitted them for this, but for another reason. What
other? That His strength might be the more displayed; “For,”
saith he, “My grace is sufficient for thee, for My power is made
perfect in weakness.” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. 1.9" id="v.ii-p37.4" parsed="|2Cor|1|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.1.9">ver. 9</scripRef>.) But, as I said, he
no where forgetteth his own peculiar character, classing himself
with those who fall short exceedingly and stand in need of much
discipline and correction. For if one or two trials suffice to
sober even ordinary men, how should he who of all men had most
cultivated lowliness of mind his whole life long and had suffered
as no other man did, after so many years and a practice of wisdom<note place="end" n="402" id="v.ii-p37.5"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii-p38"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.ii-p38.1">φιλοσοφίαν</span>.</p></note> worthy of
the heavens, be in need of this admonition? Whence it is plain
that here too, it is from modesty and to calm down those who
thought highly of themselves and boasted, that he thus speaks,
“That we should not trust in ourselves, but in God.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.ii-p39">[4.] And observe how he treateth them
tenderly<note place="end" n="403" id="v.ii-p39.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii-p40"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.ii-p40.1">θεραπεύει</span>.</p></note> here also.
For, saith he, these trials were permitted to come upon us for your
sakes; of so great price<note place="end" n="404" id="v.ii-p40.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii-p41"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.ii-p41.1">τοσούτου τιμᾶται

“whether we be afflicted,” saith he, “it is for your
consolation and salvation;” but they were “out of measure”
for our sake, lest we should be high minded. “For we were
weighed down exceedingly, beyond our power, that we should not
trust in ourselves, but in God that raiseth the dead.” He again
putteth them in mind of the doctrine of the Resurrection whereon he
said so much in the former Epistle, and confirmeth it from the
present circumstance; whence he added,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.ii-p42"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 1.10" id="v.ii-p42.1" parsed="|2Cor|1|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.1.10">Ver. 10</scripRef>. “Who delivered us

<p class="c19" id="v.ii-p44">He said not, “from so great dangers,” at once
showing the insupportable severity of the trials, and confirming
the doctrine I have mentioned. For whereas the Resurrection was a
thing future, he showeth that it happeneth every day: for when
[God] lifteth up again a man who is despaired of and hath been
brought to the very gates of Hades, He showeth none other thing
than a resurrection, snatching out of the very jaws of death him
that had fallen into them: whence in the case of those despaired
of and then restored either out of grievous sickness or
insupportable trials, it is an ordinary way of speaking to say, We
have seen a resurrection of the dead in his case.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.ii-p47">Since the words, “that we should not trust
in ourselves,” might seem to be a common charge and an accusation
that pointed to some amongst them; he softeneth<note place="end" n="407" id="v.ii-p47.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii-p48"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.ii-p48.1">παραμυθεῖται</span>.</p></note> again what he said, by calling

where aught of being forsaken, but of succor again and support.
Then, lest on hearing that they were to be continually in perils
they should be cast down, he showed before the use of perils; for
instance, “that we should not trust in ourselves;” that is,
that he may keep us in continual humility, and that their salvation
may be wrought; and many other uses besides; the being partakers
with Christ; (“for,” saith he, “the sufferings of Christ
abound in us;”) the suffering for the faithful; (“for,” saith
he, “whether we be afflicted, it is for your comfort and
salvation;”) the superior lustre this last (i.e., their
salvation) should shine with<note place="end" n="410" id="v.ii-p50.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii-p51"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.ii-p51.1">διαλάμπειν μειζόνως</span>.

“worketh” [in you] “in the patient enduring of the same
sufferings;” their being made hardy; and besides all these, that
of seeing the resurrection vividly portrayed before their eyes: 
for, “He hath delivered us out of so great death;” being of an
earnest mind and ever looking unto Him, “for,” saith he, “we

prayers, for he saith, “ye also helping together on our behalf by

and then having made them energetic: he anointeth once more their

great things of their prayers, for that to these God had granted<note place="end" n="412" id="v.ii-p52.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii-p53"> The marginal reading of Savile, which Mr. Field has

deaths,” saith he, “ye also helping together by prayer;” that
is, praying all of you for us. For “the gift bestowed upon
us,” that is, our being saved, He was pleased to grant to you
all, in order that many persons might give Him thanks, because that
many also received the boon.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.ii-p55">[5.] And this he said, at once to stir them
up to prayer for others, and to accustom them always to give thanks
to God for whatever befalleth others, showing that He too willeth
this exceedingly. For they that are careful to do both these for
others, will much more for themselves show an example of both.
And besides this, he both teacheth them humility and leadeth on to
more fervent love. For if he who was so high above them owneth
himself to have been saved by their prayers: and that to their
prayers himself<note place="end" n="414" id="v.ii-p55.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii-p56"> Ben. <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.ii-p56.1">αὐτῷ</span>, that a gift

granted as a boon of God, think what their modesty and disposition
ought to have been. And observe, I pray you, this also; that even
if God doeth any thing in mercy, yet prayer doth mightily
contribute thereunto. For at the first he attributed his
salvation to His mercies; for “The God of mercies,” he says,
Himself “delivered us,” but here to the prayers also. For on
him too that owed the ten thousand talents He had mercy after that
he fell at His feet; (<scripRef passage="Matt. xviii. 24, 27" id="v.ii-p56.2" parsed="|Matt|18|24|0|0;|Matt|18|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.18.24 Bible:Matt.18.27">Matt. xviii. 24, 27</scripRef>.) although it is
written, that “being moved with compassion, He loosed him.”
And again to the “woman of Canaan,” it was after that long
attendance and importunity<note place="end" n="415" id="v.ii-p56.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii-p57"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.ii-p57.1">προσεδρείαν καὶ καρ

healing of her daughter, even though of His mercy He healed her.
Hereby then we learn that even though we are to receive mercy, we
must first make ourselves worthy of the mercy; for though there be
mercy, yet it seeketh out those that are worthy. It will not come
upon all without distinction; those even who have no feeling; for
He saith, “I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will
have compassion on whom I have compassion.” (<scripRef passage="Rom. ix. 15" id="v.ii-p57.3" parsed="|Rom|9|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.9.15">Rom. ix. 15</scripRef>.) Observe at least
what he saith here, “Ye also helping together by prayer.” He
hath neither ascribed the whole of the good work to them lest he
should lift them up, nor yet deprived them of all share whatever in
it, in order to encourage them and animate their zeal, and bring
them together one to another. Whence also he said, “He also
granted to you my safety.” For ofttimes also God is abashed<note place="end" n="416" id="v.ii-p57.4"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii-p58"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.ii-p58.1">δυσωπεῖται</span>.</p></note> by a
multitude praying with one mind and mouth. Whence also He said to
the prophet, “And shall not I spare this city wherein dwell more
than six score thousand persons?” (<scripRef passage="Jonah iv. 11" id="v.ii-p58.2" parsed="|Jonah|4|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Jonah.4.11">Jonah iv. 11</scripRef>.) Then lest thou think He
respecteth the multitude only, He saith, “Though the number of
Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved.”
(<scripRef passage="Isa. x. 22" id="v.ii-p58.3" parsed="|Isa|10|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.10.22">Isa. x. 22</scripRef>.) How then saved He the
Ninevites? Because in their case, there was not <pb n="281" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_281.html" id="v.ii-Page_281" />only a multitude, but a multitude and
virtue too. For each one “turned from” his “evil way.”
(<scripRef passage="Jonah iii. 10; iv. 11" id="v.ii-p58.4" parsed="|Jonah|3|10|0|0;|Jonah|4|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Jonah.3.10 Bible:Jonah.4.11">Jonah iii. 10; iv.
11</scripRef>.) And besides, when
He saved them, He said that they discerned not “between their
right hand and their left hand:” whence it is plain that even
before, they sinned more out of simpleness than of wickedness: it
is plain too from their being converted, as they were, by hearing a
few words. But if their being six score thousand were of itself
enough to save them, what hindered even before this that they
should be saved? And why saith He not to the Prophet, And shall I
not spare this city which so turneth itself? but bringeth forward
the score thousands. He produceth this also as a reason over and
above. For that they had turned was known to the prophet, but he
knew not either their numbers or their simpleness. So by every
possible consideration he is desirous to soften them. For even
greatness of number hath power, when there is virtue withal. And
truly the Scripture elsewhere also showeth this plainly, where it
saith, “But prayer was made earnestly of the Church unto God for
him:” (<scripRef passage="Acts xii. 5" id="v.ii-p58.5" parsed="|Acts|12|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.12.5">Acts xii.
5</scripRef>.) and so great
power had it, even when the doors were shut and chains lay on him
and keepers were sleeping by on either side, that it led the
Apostle forth and delivered him from them all. But as where there
is virtue, greatness of number hath mighty power; so where
wickedness is, it profiteth nothing. For the Israelites of whom
He saith that the number of them was as the sand of the sea,
perished every one, and those too in the days of Noe were both
many, yea, numberless; and yet this profited them nothing. For
greatness of number hath no power of itself, but only as an
adjunct<note place="end" n="417" id="v.ii-p58.6"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii-p59"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.ii-p59.1">ἐν

also learn<note place="end" n="419" id="v.ii-p61.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii-p62"> “And let us learn.” Benedict.</p></note> to give
thanks with more earnestness: for they that give thanks for the
things of others, much more will they for their own. This also
was David wont to do, saying, “Magnify the Lord with me, and let
us exalt His name together;” (<scripRef passage="Ps. xxxiv. 3" id="v.ii-p62.1" parsed="|Ps|34|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.34.3">Ps. xxxiv. 3</scripRef>.) this the Apostle too
doth every where require. This let us too labor in; and let us
show forth unto all the beneficence of God that we may get
companions in the act of praise: for if when we have received any
good from men, by proclaiming it forth we make them the readier to
serve us: much more shall we, by telling abroad the benefits of
God, draw Him on to more good-will. And if when we have received
benefits of men we stir up others also to join us in the giving of
thanks, much more ought we to bring many unto God who may give
thanks for us. For if Paul who had so great confidence [toward
God] doth this, much more is it necessary for us to do it. Let us
then exhort the saints to give thanks for us; and let us do the
same ourselves for one another. To priests especially this good
work belongs, since it is an exceeding privilege<note place="end" n="420" id="v.ii-p62.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii-p63"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.ii-p63.1">μέγιστον ἀγαθὸν</span>.</p></note>. For drawing near, we first give

seest it as large as all men have seen it; so that thou owest a
thanksgiving as great as all together; and thou oughtest to give
thanks for what all have in common and likewise for the virtue of
others; for on account of others, too, we receive many blessings: 
for had there been found in Sodom ten righteous only, they had not
suffered what they did. So then let us give thanks also for the
confidence of others [toward God]. For this custom is an ancient
one, planted in the Church from the beginning. Thus Paul also
giveth thanks for the Romans, (<scripRef passage="Rom. i. 8" id="v.ii-p67.2" parsed="|Rom|1|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.1.8">Rom. i. 8</scripRef>.) for the Corinthians, (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. i. 4" id="v.ii-p67.3" parsed="|1Cor|1|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.1.4">1 Cor. i. 4</scripRef>.) for the whole world, (<scripRef passage="1 Tim. ii. 1" id="v.ii-p67.4" parsed="|1Tim|2|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.2.1">1 Tim. ii. 1</scripRef>.) And tell
me not, “The good work is none of mine;” for though it be none
of thine, yet even so oughtest thou to give thanks that thy member
is such an one. And besides, by thy acclamation thou makest it
thine own, and sharest in the crown, and shalt thyself also receive
the gift. On this account it is that the laws of the Church<note place="end" n="425" id="v.ii-p67.5"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii-p68"> See Bingham, <i>Christian Antiqu</i>. book
xiv. ch. 5. §. 3. Goar, pp. 70, and 161.</p></note> command
prayer also to be thus made, and that not for the faithful only,
but also for the Catechumens. For the law stirreth up the
faithful to make supplication for the uninitiated<note place="end" n="426" id="v.ii-p68.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii-p69"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.ii-p69.1">ἀ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.ii-p69.2">μυήτων</span>.</p></note>. For when the Deacon saith<note place="end" n="427" id="v.ii-p69.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii-p70"> The whole Prayer for the Catechumens, as gathered
from the Homily, will stand thus. “Let us pray earnestly for
the Catechumens, That the all-pitying and merciful God would listen
to their prayers, that He would open the ears of their hearts and
instil into them the word of truth, that He would sow His fear in
them and confirm His faith in their minds, that He would unveil to
them the Gospel of righteousness, that He would grant to them a
godly mind, sound judgment, and virtuous manner of life;
continually to think those things which be His, to mind those
things which be His, to practise those things which be His, to be
occupied in His law day and night, to remember His commandments, to
keep His judgments.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.ii-p71">“Let us beseech for them yet more
earnestly, That He would deliver them from every evil and
inordinate thing, from every devilish sin, and from every besetment
of the adversary, that He would count them worthy in due season of
the Regeneration of the Laver, of the remission of sins, of the
clothing of incorruption, that He would bless their comings in and
goings out, the whole course of their life, their houses and
households, that He would increase their children and bless them,
and bring them to full age, and teach them wisdom, that He would
direct all that is before them unto good.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.ii-p72">“Stand up. Pray, ye Catechumens,
for the Angel of peace, that all that is before you may be
peaceful; pray that this day and all the days of your life be full
of peace, that your ends may be Christian; commend yourselves to
the living God and to His Christ.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.ii-p73">“Bow ye the head. All respond
aloud, Amen.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.ii-p74">A similar Prayer for the
Catechumens, with a few variations, is found in the <i>Apostolic
Constitutions</i>, lib. viii. cap. 6. Mr. Field considers it to
be of later date than that given above.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.ii-p75">“Pray, ye Catechumens, and all ye
faithful, pray for them in heart, saying, Lord have mercy. And
let the deacon speak for them according to his office, saying for
the Catechumens let us all beseech God.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.ii-p76">“That the Good [God], the Lover of
men, would favorably hearken to their supplications and prayers,
and accepting their suppliant addresses would help them, and grant
unto them the requests of their hearts as may be expedient for
them, and would reveal unto them the Gospel of his Christ, would
enlighten them, and give them understanding, would instruct them in
the knowledge of God, would teach them His ordinances and
judgments, implant in them His pure and saving fear, would open the
ears of their hearts to be occupied in His law day and night, and
confirm them in godliness, would unite them to, and enrol them in
His holy flock counting them worthy of the Laver of Regeneration,
the clothing of incorruption, the true life, and would deliver them
from all ungodliness, and give none occasion to the enemy* against
them, but cleanse them from all filthiness of flesh and spirit, and
dwell and walk in them by His Christ, would bless their comings in
and goings out, and direct for them all that is before them unto
good.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.ii-p77">“Let us again earnestly supplicate
for them:</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.ii-p78">“That obtaining remission of their
offences by the initiation, they may be counted worthy of the holy
mysteries, and of constant communion with the saints.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.ii-p79">“Stand up; ye Catechumens. Pray
for the peace of God through His Christ, that this day, and all the
time of your life, may be peaceful, and without sin, that your ends
may be Christian, God merciful and favorable; pray for remission of
offences; commend yourselves unto the only unbegotten God through
His Christ.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.ii-p80">“Bow, and receive the
blessing.”</p>

seems to be used in Diodorus and Polybius for hostile,
inimical.</p></note>, “Let us
pray earnestly for the <pb n="282" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_282.html" id="v.ii-Page_282" />Catechumens,” he doth no other
than excite the whole multitude of the faithful to pray for them;
although the Catechumens are as yet aliens. For they are not yet
of the Body of Christ, they have not yet partaken of the Mysteries,
but are still divided from the spiritual flock. But if we ought
to intercede for these, much more for our own members. And even
therefore he saith, “earnestly let us pray,” that thou
shouldest not disown them as aliens, that thou shouldest not
disregard them as strangers. For as yet they have not the
appointed<note place="end" n="428" id="v.ii-p81.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii-p82"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.ii-p82.1">νενομισμένην</span>.</p></note> prayer,
which Christ brought in; as yet they have not confidence, but have
need of others’ aid who have been initiated. For without the
king’s courts they stand, far from the sacred precincts<note place="end" n="429" id="v.ii-p82.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii-p83"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.ii-p83.1">περιβόλων</span>.</p></note>. Therefore
they are even driven away whilst those awful prayers are being
offered. Therefore also he exhorteth thee to pray for them that
they may become members of thee, that they may be no longer
strangers and aliens. For the words, “Let us pray,” are not
addressed to the priests alone, but also to those that make up the
people: for when he saith, “Let us stand in order<note place="end" n="430" id="v.ii-p83.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii-p84"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.ii-p84.1">Στῶμεν καλῶς</span>.</p></note>: let us
pray;” he exhorteth all to the prayer.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.ii-p85">[7.] Then beginning the prayer, he saith,
“That the all-pitying and merciful God would listen to their
prayers.” For that thou mayest not say, What shall we pray?
they are aliens, not yet united [to the body]. Whereby can I
constrain<note place="end" n="431" id="v.ii-p85.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii-p86"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.ii-p86.1">δυσωπῆσαι</span>.</p></note> the regard
of God? Whence can I prevail with Him to impart unto them mercy
and forgiveness? That thou mayest not be perplexed with such
questions as these, see how he disentangleth thy perplexity,
saying, “that the all-pitying and merciful God.” Heardest
thou? “All-pitying God.” Be perplexed no more. For the
All-pitying pitieth all, both sinners and friends. Say not then,
“How shall I approach Him for them?” Himself will listen to
their prayers. And the Catechumens’ prayer, what can it be but
that they may not remain Catechumens? Next, he suggesteth also
the manner of the prayer. And what is this? “That He would
open the ears of their hearts;” for they are as yet shut and
stopped up. “Ears,” he saith, not these which be outward, but
those of the understanding, “so as to hear ‘the things which
eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered<note place="end" n="432" id="v.ii-p86.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii-p87"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.ii-p87.1">ἀ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.ii-p87.2">ποῤῥήτων</span>.</p></note> into the
heart of man.’” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. ii. 9; Is. liv. 4" id="v.ii-p87.3" parsed="|1Cor|2|9|0|0;|Isa|54|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.2.9 Bible:Isa.54.4">1 Cor. ii. 9; Is. liv. 4</scripRef>.) For they have not heard
the untold mysteries; but they stand somewhere at a distance and
far off from them; and even if they should hear, they know not what
is said; for those [mysteries] need much understanding, not hearing
only: and the inward ears as yet they have not: wherefore also
he next invoketh for them a Prophet’s gift, for the Prophet spoke
on this wise; “God giveth me the tongue of instruction, that I
should know how to speak a word in season; for He opened my mouth;
He gave to me betimes in the morning; He granted me a hearing
ear.” (<scripRef passage="Is. i. 4" id="v.ii-p87.4" parsed="|Isa|1|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.1.4">Is. i. 4</scripRef>. Sept.) For as the
Prophets heard otherwise than the many, so also do the faithful
than the Catechumens. Hereby the Catechumen also is taught not to
learn to hear these things of men, (for He saith, “Call no man
master upon the earth<note place="end" n="433" id="v.ii-p87.5"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii-p88"> rec. text, <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.ii-p88.1">πατέρα ὑμῶν</span>,

“For they shall be all taught of God.” (<scripRef passage="Is. liv. 13" id="v.ii-p88.3" parsed="|Isa|54|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.54.13">Is. liv.

<p class="c19" id="v.ii-p89">Wherefore he says, “And instil<note place="end" n="434" id="v.ii-p89.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii-p90"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.ii-p90.1">κατηχήσῃ</span>.</p></note> into them
the word of truth,” so that it may be inwardly learned<note place="end" n="435" id="v.ii-p90.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii-p91"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.ii-p91.1">ἐ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.ii-p91.2">νηχεῖσθαι</span>.</p></note>; for as yet
they know not the word of truth as they ought to know. “That He
would sow His fear in them.” But this is not enough; for
“some fell by the wayside, and some upon the rock.” But we
ask not thus; but as on 
<pb n="283" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_283.html" id="v.ii-Page_283" />rich soil the plough openeth the furrows,
so we pray it may be here also, that having the fallow ground of
their minds<note place="end" n="436" id="v.ii-p91.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii-p92"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.ii-p92.1">νεωθέντας ἐν τῷ βάθει τῆς
διανοίας</span>.</p></note> tilled deep,
they may receive what is dropped upon them and accurately retain
everything they have heard. Whence also he adds, “And confirm
His faith in their minds;” that is, that it may not lie on the
surface, but strike its root deep downwards. “That He would
unveil to them the Gospel of Righteousness.” He showeth that
the veil is two-fold, partly that the eyes of their understanding
were shut, partly that the Gospel was hidden from them. Whence he
said a little above, “that He would open the ears of their
hearts,” and here, “that he would unveil unto them the Gospel
of Righteousness;” that is, both that He would render them wise
and apt for receiving<note place="end" n="437" id="v.ii-p92.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii-p93"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.ii-p93.1">προς ὑποδοχὴν</span>.</p></note> seed, and that He would teach them
and drop the seed into them; for though they should be apt, yet if
God reveal not, this profiteth nothing; and if God should unveil
but they receive not, there resulteth like unprofitableness.
 Therefore we ask for both: that He would both open their hearts
and unveil the Gospel. For neither if kingly ornaments lie
underneath a veil, will it profit at all that the eyes be looking;
nor yet that they be laid bare, if the eyes be not waking<note place="end" n="438" id="v.ii-p93.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii-p94"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.ii-p94.1">μὴ ἐγρηγορότων</span>.</p></note>. But both
will be granted, if first they<note place="end" n="439" id="v.ii-p94.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii-p95"> i.e., the Catechumens.</p></note> themselves desire it. But what
then is “the Gospel of Righteousness?” That which maketh
righteous. By these words he leadeth them to the desire of
Baptism, showing that the Gospel is for the working<note place="end" n="440" id="v.ii-p95.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii-p96"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.ii-p96.1">ποιητικόν</span>.</p></note> not only of
the remission of sins, but also of righteousness.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.ii-p97">[8.] “That He would grant to them a godly
mind, sound judgment, and virtuous manner of life<note place="end" n="441" id="v.ii-p97.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii-p98"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.ii-p98.1">νοῦν ἔνθεον, σώφρονα λογισμὸν

does not come up to the meaning of the original <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.ii-p98.2"> ἔνθεος</span>, “into which God is

attend as are rivetted<note place="end" n="442" id="v.ii-p98.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii-p99"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.ii-p99.1">προσηλωμένοι</span>.</p></note> to the things of [this] life. For
if we are bidden to ask these things for the uninitiated: think
in what things we ought to be occupied who ask these things for
others. For the manner of life ought to keep pace with<note place="end" n="443" id="v.ii-p99.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii-p100"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.ii-p100.1">ἐ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.ii-p100.2">φάμιλλον</span>.</p></note> the
Gospel. Whence surely also the order of the prayer<note place="end" n="444" id="v.ii-p100.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii-p101"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.ii-p101.1">ὀ  νόμος τῆς εὐχῆς</span>.</p></note> shifts from
the doctrines [of the Gospel] to the deportment: for to the
words, “that He would unveil to them the Gospel of
Righteousness;” it hath added, “that He would give unto them a
Godly mind.” And what is this “Godly?” That God may dwell
in it. For He saith, “I will dwell in them, and walk in
them;” (<scripRef passage="Lev. xxvi. 12" id="v.ii-p101.2" parsed="|Lev|26|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Lev.26.12">Lev.
xxvi. 12</scripRef>.) for when the
mind is become righteous, when it hath put off its sins, it
becometh God’s dwelling. (<scripRef passage="Rom. vi. 16" id="v.ii-p101.3" parsed="|Rom|6|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.6.16">Rom. vi. 16</scripRef>.) But when God indwelleth,
nothing of man will be left. And thus doth the mind become Godly,
speaking every word from Him, even as in truth an house of God
dwelling in it. Surely then the filthy in speech hath not a Godly
mind, nor he who delighteth in jesting and laughter.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.ii-p102">“Sound judgment.” And what can it be to
have “a sound judgment?” To enjoy the health that pertaineth
to the soul: for he that is held down by wicked lusts and
dazzled<note place="end" n="445" id="v.ii-p102.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii-p103"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.ii-p103.1">ἐ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.ii-p103.2">πτοημένος</span>.</p></note> with present
things, never can be sound, that is, healthy. But as one who is
diseased lusteth even after things which are unfit for him, so also
doth he. “And a virtuous mode of life,” for the doctrines
need a mode of life [answerable]. Attend to this, ye who come to
baptism at the close of life, for we indeed pray that after baptism
ye may have also this deportment, but thou art seeking and doing
thy utmost to depart without it. For, what though thou be
justified<note place="end" n="446" id="v.ii-p103.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii-p104"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.ii-p104.1">δίκαιος</span>.</p></note>: yet is it
of faith only. But we pray that thou shouldest have as well the
confidence that cometh of good works.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.ii-p105">“Continually to think those things which be
His, to mind those things which be His, to practise<note place="end" n="447" id="v.ii-p105.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii-p106"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.ii-p106.1">μελετᾶν</span>.</p></note> those things
which be His:” for we ask not to have sound judgment and
virtuous deportment for one day only, or for two or three, but
through the whole tenor and period<note place="end" n="448" id="v.ii-p106.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii-p107"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.ii-p107.1">τοῦ βίου καὶ τῆς

of all good things, “to mind those things which be His.” For
the many “seek their own, not the things which are Jesus
Christ’s.” (<scripRef passage="Philip. ii. 21" id="v.ii-p107.2" parsed="|Phil|2|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Phil.2.21">Philip. ii. 21</scripRef>.) How then might this
be? (For besides prayer, need is that we contribute also our own
endeavors.) If we be<note place="end" n="449" id="v.ii-p107.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii-p108"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.ii-p108.1">καταγινώμεθα</span>.</p></note> occupied in His law day and
night. Whence he goeth on to ask this also, “to be occupied in
His law;” and as he said above, “continually,” so here “day
and night.” Wherefore I even blush for these who scarce once in
the year are seen in church. For what excuse can they have who
are bidden not simply “day and night” to commune with the law
but “to be occupied in,” that is, to be for ever holding
converse with it<note place="end" n="450" id="v.ii-p108.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii-p109"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.ii-p109.1">προσαδολεσχειν</span>.</p></note>, and yet
scarce do so for the smallest fraction of their life?</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.ii-p110">“To remember His commandments, to keep His
judgments.” Seest thou what an excellent chain is here? and how
each link hangs by the next compacted with more strength and beauty
than any chain of gold? For having asked for a Godly mind, he
telleth whereby this may be produced. Whereby? By continually
practising<note place="end" n="451" id="v.ii-p110.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii-p111"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.ii-p111.1">μελετᾶν</span>.</p></note> it. And
how might this be brought about? 
<pb n="284" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_284.html" id="v.ii-Page_284" />By constantly giving heed to the Law. And
how might men be persuaded to this? If they should keep His
Commandments: yea rather, from giving heed to the law cometh also
the keeping His Commandments; as likewise from minding the things
which be His and from having a Godly mind, cometh the practising
the things which be His. For each of the things mentioned
jointly<note place="end" n="452" id="v.ii-p111.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii-p112"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.ii-p112.1">συγκατασκευάζέι</span>.</p></note> procureth
and is procured by the next, both linking it and being linked by
it.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.ii-p113">[9.] “Let us beseech for them yet more
earnestly.” For since by length of speaking the soul useth to
grow drowsy, he again arouseth it up, for he purposeth to ask again
certain great and lofty things. Wherefore he saith, “Let us
beseech for them yet more earnestly.” And what is this? 
“That He would deliver them from every evil and inordinate<note place="end" n="453" id="v.ii-p113.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii-p114"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.ii-p114.1">ἀ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.ii-p114.2">τόπου</span>.</p></note> thing.”
Here we ask for them that they may not enter into temptation, but
be delivered from every snare, a deliverance as well bodily as

the adversary,” meaning, temptations and sins. For sin doth
easily beset, taking its stand on every side, before, behind, and
so casting down. For, after telling us what ought to be done by
us, namely, to be occupied in His law, to remember His
Commandments, to keep His judgments, he assures us next that not
even is this enough, except Himself stand by and succor. For,
“Except the Lord build the house, they labor in vain that build
it;” (<scripRef passage="Ps. cxxvii. 1" id="v.ii-p116.2" parsed="|Ps|127|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.127.1">Ps. cxxvii.

in the case of those who are yet exposed to the devil and are under
his dominion. And ye that are initiated know this well. For
call to mind, for instance, those words wherein ye renounced<note place="end" n="456" id="v.ii-p116.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii-p117"> See Bingham, <i>Antiq</i>. l. xi. c. 8. §.

whereby we are taught in nothing whatever to obey him. But he
calleth him adversary and accuser, because he both accuseth God to
man and us to God, and us again one to another. For at one time
he accused Job to God, saying, “Doth Job serve the Lord for
nought?” (<scripRef passage="Job i. 9" id="v.ii-p119.2" parsed="|Job|1|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Job.1.9">Job i.

<p class="c19" id="v.ii-p123">“That He would count them worthy in due

instruct them to know its power. For what is said thenceforth
familiarizes them to know already that what is there done is a
regeneration, and that we are born again of the waters, just as of
the womb; that they say not after Nicodemus, “How<note place="end" n="463" id="v.ii-p124.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii-p125"> <scripRef passage="John iii. 4" id="v.ii-p125.1" parsed="|John|3|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.3.4">John iii.

born when he is old!  Can he enter into his mother’s womb, and
be born again?” Then, because he had spoken of “remission of
sins,” he confirmeth this by the words next following, “of the
clothing of incorruption;” for he that putteth on sonship plainly
becometh incorruptible. But what is that “in due season?”
When any is well disposed, when any cometh thereunto with
earnestness and faith; for this is the “due season” of the
believer.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.ii-p126">[10.] “That He would bless their coming in
and their going out, the whole course of their life.” Here they
are directed to ask even for some bodily good, as being yet
somewhat weak. “Their houses and their households,” that is,
if they have servants or kinsfolk or any others belonging to
them. For these were the rewards of the old Covenant; and nothing
then was feared so much as widowhood, childlessness, untimely
mournings, to be visited with famine, to have their affairs go on
unprosperously. And hence it is, that he alloweth these also
fondly<note place="end" n="464" id="v.ii-p126.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii-p127"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.ii-p127.1">ἐ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.ii-p127.2">μφιλοχωρεῖν</span>.</p></note> to linger

little to higher things. For so too doth Christ; so too doth
Paul, making mention of the ancient blessings: Christ, when He
saith, “Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the
earth;” Paul, when he saith, 
<pb n="285" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_285.html" id="v.ii-Page_285" />“Honor thy father and thy mother.…and
thou shalt live long on the earth.” “That He would increase
their children and bless them, and bring them to full age, and
teach<note place="end" n="466" id="v.ii-p128.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii-p129"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.ii-p129.1">σοφίσῃ</span>.</p></note> them
wisdom.” Here again is both a bodily and spiritual thing, as
for persons yet but too much babes in disposition. Then what
follows is altogether spiritual, “that He would direct all that
is before them<note place="end" n="467" id="v.ii-p129.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii-p130"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.ii-p130.1">τὰ προκείμενα</span>.</p></note> unto
good;” for he saith not simply, “all that is before them,”
but, “all that is before them unto good.” For often a journey
is before a man, but it is not good; or some other such thing,
which is not profitable. Hereby they are taught in every thing to
give thanks to God, as happening for good. After all this, he
bids them stand up during what follows. For having before cast
them to the ground, when they have asked what they have asked and
have been filled with confidence, now the word<note place="end" n="468" id="v.ii-p130.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii-p131"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.ii-p131.1">ὁ  λόγος</span>.</p></note> given raiseth them up, and biddeth
them during what follows engage for themselves also in supplication
to God. For part we say ourselves, and part we permit them to
say, now opening unto them the door of prayer, (exactly as we first
teach children [what to say], and then bid them say it of
themselves,) saying, “Pray ye, Catechumens, for the angel of
peace;” for there is an angel that punisheth, as when He saith,
“A band of evil angels,” (<scripRef passage="Ps. lxxviii. 49" id="v.ii-p131.2" parsed="|Ps|78|49|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.78.49">Ps. lxxviii. 49</scripRef>.) there is that destroyeth.
Wherefore we bid them ask for the angel of peace, teaching them to
seek that which is the bond of all good things, peace; so that they
may be delivered from all fightings, all wars, all seditions.
“That all that is before you may be peaceful;” for even if a
thing be burdensome, if a man have peace, it is light. Wherefore
Christ also said, “My peace I give unto you” (<scripRef passage="John  xiv. 27" id="v.ii-p131.3">John  xiv. 27</scripRef>.) for the devil hath no
weapon so strong as fighting, and enmity, and war. “Pray that
this day and all the days of your life be full<note place="end" n="469" id="v.ii-p131.4"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii-p132"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.ii-p132.1">εἰρηνικὴν</span>.</p></note> of peace.” Seest thou how he
again insisteth that the whole life be passed in virtue? “That
your ends be Christian;” your highest good, the honorable and the
expedient<note place="end" n="470" id="v.ii-p132.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii-p133"> Some include the words <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.ii-p133.1">τὸ καλὸν
και τὸ συμφέρον</span> in the form of prayer.</p></note>; for what is
not honorable is not expedient either. For our idea of the nature
of expediency is different from that of the many. “Commend
yourselves to the living God and to His Christ;” for as yet we
trust them not to pray for others, but it is sufficient<note place="end" n="471" id="v.ii-p133.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii-p134"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.ii-p134.1">ἀ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.ii-p134.2">γαπητὸν</span>.</p></note> to be able
to pray for themselves.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.ii-p135">Seest thou the completeness of this prayer,
both in regard of doctrine and of behavior? for when we have
mentioned the Gospel and the clothing of incorruption and the Laver
of Regeneration, we have mentioned all the doctrines: when again
we spoke of a Godly mind, a sound understanding, and the rest of
what we said, we suggested<note place="end" n="472" id="v.ii-p135.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii-p136"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.ii-p136.1">ᾐ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.ii-p136.2">νιξάμεθα</span>.</p></note> the mode of life. Then we bid
them<note place="end" n="473" id="v.ii-p136.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii-p137"> The same direction was also given to the
Energumeni. See <i>de Incomprehens</i>. Nat. Hom. 3. §. 7. and
4. §. 4.</p></note> bow their
heads; regarding it as a proof of their prayers being heard that
God blessed them. For surely it is not a man that blesseth; but
by means of his hand and his tongue we bring unto the King Himself
the heads of those that are present. And all together shout the
“Amen.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.ii-p138">Now why have I said all this? To teach you
that we ought to seek the things of others, that the faithful may
not think it no concern of theirs when these things are said. For
not to the walls surely doth the Deacon say, “Let us pray for the
Catechumens.” But some are so without understanding, so stupid,
so depraved<note place="end" n="474" id="v.ii-p138.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii-p139"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.ii-p139.1">διαλελυμένοι</span>.</p></note>, as to stand
and talk not only during the time of the Catechumens, but also
during the time of the faithful. Hence all is perverted; hence
all is utterly lost: for at the very time when we ought most to
propitiate God, we go away having provoked Him. So again in [the
prayers of] the faithful<note place="end" n="475" id="v.ii-p139.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii-p140"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.ii-p140.1">ἐπὶ
τῶν πιστῶν</span>.</p></note>, we are bidden to approach the God
that loveth men, for Bishops, for Priests, for Kings, for those in
authority, for earth and sea, for the seasons<note place="end" n="476" id="v.ii-p140.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii-p141"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.ii-p141.1">ὑπὲρ
ἁέρων</span>.</p></note>, for the whole world. When then
we who ought to have such boldness as to pray for others, are
scarce awake even whilst praying for ourselves, how can we excuse
ourselves? how find pardon? Wherefore I beseech you that laying
all this to heart, ye would know the time of prayer, and be lifted
up and disengaged from earth, and touch the vault itself of heaven;
so that we may have power to make God propitious and obtain the
good things promised, whereunto may we all attain, through the
grace and love towards men of our Lord Jesus Christ; with Whom unto
the Father, together with the Holy Ghost, be glory, might, honor,
now and for ever, and world without end. Amen.</p>

inserted by Mr. Field on the authority of two ancient <span class="c18" id="v.iii-p7.1">mss</span>.</p></note>, and God
delivered us, and had ascribed all to His mercies and their
prayers, lest he should thus make the hearer supine, presuming on
God’s mercy only and the prayers of others, he showeth that they
themselves<note place="end" n="480" id="v.iii-p7.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p8"> i.e. the Apostles.</p></note> had
contributed not a little of their<note place="end" n="481" id="v.iii-p8.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p9"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.iii-p9.1">οἵκοθεν</span>.</p></note> own. And indeed he showed as much
even before, when he said, “For as the sufferings of Christ
abound [in us,] so our consolation also aboundeth.”
(<scripRef passage="2 Cor. 1.5" id="v.iii-p9.2" parsed="|2Cor|1|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.1.5">ver. 5</scripRef>.) But here he is
speaking of a certain other good work, properly their own<note place="end" n="482" id="v.iii-p9.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p10"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.iii-p10.1">οἰκεῖον κατόρθωμα</span>.</p></note>. What then
is this? That, saith he, in a conscience pure and without guile
we behave ourselves every where in the world: and this availeth
not a little to our encouragement and comfort; yea, rather, not to
comfort merely, but even unto somewhat else far greater than
comfort, even to our glorying. And this he said, teaching them
too not to sink down in their afflictions, but, if so be they have
a pure conscience, even to be proud of them; and at the same time
quietly though<note place="end" n="483" id="v.iii-p10.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p11"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.iii-p11.1">ἠρέμα
καθαπτόμενος</span>.</p></note> gently
hitting at the false Apostles. And as in the former Epistle he
saith, “Christ sent me to preach the Gospel, not in wisdom of
words, lest the Cross of Christ should be made of none effect:”
(<scripRef passage="1 Cor. i. 17" id="v.iii-p11.2" parsed="|1Cor|1|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.1.17">1 Cor. i. 17</scripRef>.) and, “that your faith
should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God;”
(<scripRef passage="1 Cor. 2.5" id="v.iii-p11.3" parsed="|1Cor|2|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.2.5">ib.
ii. 5</scripRef>.) so here also,
“Not in wisdom, but in the grace of Christ.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iii-p12">And he hinted also something besides, by
employing the words, “not in wisdom,” that is, ‘not in
deceit,’ here too striking at the heathen discipline<note place="end" n="484" id="v.iii-p12.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p13"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.iii-p13.1">τὴν ἔξω παίδευσιν</span>.</p></note>. “For
our glorying,” saith he, “is this, the testimony of our
conscience;” that is, our conscience not having whereof to
condemn us, as if for evil doings we were persecuted. For though
we suffer countless horrors, though from every quarter we be shot
at and in peril, it is enough for our comfort, yea rather not only
for comfort, but even for our crowning, that our conscience is pure
and testifieth unto us that for no evil-doing, but for that which
is well-pleasing to God, we thus suffer; for virtue’s sake, for
heavenly wisdom’s, for the salvation of the many. Now that
previous consolation was from God: but this was contributed by
themselves and from the purity of their life. Wherefore also he
calls it their glorying<note place="end" n="485" id="v.iii-p13.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p14"> Or “boast” <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.iii-p14.1"> καύχησις</span>.</p></note>, because it was the achievement of
their own virtue. What then is this glorying and what doth our
conscience testify unto us? “That in sincerity,” that is to
say, having no deceitful thing, no hypocrisy, no dissimulation, no
flattery, no ambush or guile, nor any other such thing, but in all
frankness, in simplicity, in truth, in a pure and unmalicious
spirit, in a guileless mind, having nothing concealed, no festering
sore<note place="end" n="486" id="v.iii-p14.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p15"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.iii-p15.1">ὑ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.iii-p15.2">πούλον</span>.</p></note>. “Not in
fleshly wisdom;” that is, not with evil artifice, nor with
wickedness, nor with cleverness of words, nor with webs of
sophistries, for this he meaneth by ‘fleshly wisdom:’ and
that whereupon they<note place="end" n="487" id="v.iii-p15.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p16"> i.e. the false Apostles.</p></note> greatly prided themselves, he
disclaims and thrusts aside: showing very abundantly<note place="end" n="488" id="v.iii-p16.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p17"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.iii-p17.1">ἐκ

no worthy ground for glorying: and that not only he doth not seek
it, but he even rejecteth and is ashamed of it.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iii-p18">“But in the grace of God we behaved ourselves in
the world.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iii-p19">What is, “in the grace of God?” Displaying the
wisdom that is from Him, the power from Him given unto us, by the
signs wrought, by overcoming sages, rhetoricians, philosophers,
kings, peoples, unlearned as we are and bringing with us nothing of
the wisdom that is without. No ordinary comfort and glorying,
however, was this, to be conscious to themselves that it was not
men’s power they had used; but that by Divine grace they had
achieved all success.</p>

calls these too the grace of God, ascribing his own good works also
unto it. For in Corinth he even overleapt the goal<note place="end" n="491" id="v.iii-p23.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p24"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.iii-p24.1">τὰ σκάμματα

<p class="c19" id="v.iii-p26">For since he spoke great things of himself and

more than all others can bear us witness. For, when ye read, ye
acknowledge that what ye know that we perform in our actions, this

<p class="c19" id="v.iii-p31">[2.] Seest thou again how from the past he draws
pledges for the future; and not from the past only, but also from

one and declares that this crown of praises is theirs. For if, he
says, we have shown ourselves to be such, our praise is your
glory: even as when ye also are approved, we rejoice and leap for
joy and are crowned. Here also again he displays his great
humility by what he says. For he so levels his expressions, not
as a master discoursing to disciples, but as a disciple unto
fellow-disciples of his own rank. And observe how he lifts them
on high and fills them with philosophy, sending them on to That
Day. For, he saith, tell me not of the present things, that is,
the reproaches, the revilings, the scoffings of the many, for the
things here are no great matter, neither the good nor the painful;
nor the scoffings nor the praises which come from men: but
remember, I pray, that day of fear and shuddering in the which all
things are revealed. For then both we shall glory in you, and ye
in us; when ye shall be seen to have such teachers, who teach no
doctrine of men nor live in wickedness nor give [men] any handle;
and we to have such disciples, neither affected after the manner of
men nor shaken, but taking all things with readiness of mind, and
unseduced by sophistries<note place="end" n="496" id="v.iii-p36.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p37"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.iii-p37.1">μηδαμόθεν
παραλογιζομενους</span>.</p></note> from what side soever. For this
is plain even now to those that have understanding, but then to
all. So that even if we are afflicted now, we have this, and that
no light, consolation which the conscience affordeth now, and the
manifestation itself then. For now indeed our conscience knoweth
that we do all things by the grace of God, as ye also know and
shall know: but then, all men as well will learn both our doings
and yours: and shall behold us glorified through each other.
For that he may not appear himself alone to derive lustre from this
glorying, he gives to them also a cause of boasting, and leads them
away from their present distresses. And as he did in respect to
the consolation when he said, “We are comforted for your
sakes,” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. 1.6" id="v.iii-p37.2" parsed="|2Cor|1|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.1.6">ver. 6</scripRef>.)
so he does here also, saying, ‘we glory on your account, as ye
also on ours,’ every where making them partakers of every thing,
of his comfort, his sufferings, his preservation. For this his
preservation he ascribes to their prayers. “For God delivered
us,” he saith, “ye helping together by prayer.” In like
manner also he makes the gloryings common. For as in that place
he says, “Knowing that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so
also of the consolation:” so here too, “we are your glorying,
as ye also are ours.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iii-p40">“I was minded to come unto you, and by you to pass

<p class="c19" id="v.iii-p41">And yet he promised the contrary in his former
Epistle, saying thus: “Now I will come unto you when I shall
have passed through Macedonia: for I do pass through
Macedonia.” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. xvi. 5" id="v.iii-p41.1" parsed="|1Cor|16|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.16.5">1 Cor.

that he here says the contrary? He doth not say the contrary: 
away with the thought. For it is contrary indeed to what he
wrote, but not contrary to what he wished.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iii-p42">Wherefore also here he said not, ‘I wrote
that I would pass by you into Macedonia; but, ‘I was minded.’
‘For though I did not write on that wise,’ he says,

later than my promise that I would gladly have come before it.’
“That ye might have a second benefit<note place="end" n="497" id="v.iii-p42.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p43"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.iii-p43.1">χάριν</span>.</p></note>.” What is, a second benefit?

I show fickleness?”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iii-p47">[3.] Here in what follows, he directly does away
with the charge arising out of his delay and absence. For what he
says is of this nature. “I was minded to come unto you.”
‘Wherefore then did I not come? Is it as light-minded and
changeable?’ for this is, “did I show fickleness?” By no
means. But wherefore? “Because what things I purpose, I
purpose not according to the flesh.” What is, “not according
to the flesh?” I purpose not ‘carnally.’</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iii-p48"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 1.17" id="v.iii-p48.1" parsed="|2Cor|1|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.1.17">Ver. 17</scripRef>. “That with me there
should be the yea yea and the nay nay.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iii-p49">But still even this is obscure. What is it
then he says? The carnal man, that is, he that is rivetted to the
present things and is continually occupied in them, and is without
the sphere of the Spirit’s influence, has power to go every
where, and to wander whithersoever he will. But he that is the
servant of the Spirit, and is led, and led about by Him, cannot
everywhere be lord of his own purpose, having made it dependent
upon the authority thence given; but it so fares with him as if a
trusty servant, whose motions are always ruled by his lord’s
biddings and who has no power over himself nor is able to rest even
a little, should make some promise to his fellow-servants, and then
because his master would have it otherwise should fail to perform
his promise. This then is what he means by, “I purpose not
according to the flesh.” I am not beyond the Spirit’s
governance, nor have liberty to go where I will. For I am subject
to lordship and commands, the Comforter’s, and by His decrees I
am led, and led about. For this cause I was unable to come, for
it was not the Spirit’s will. As happened also frequently in
the Acts; for when he had purposed to come to one place, the Spirit
bade him go to another.  So that it was not from lightness, that
is, fickleness in me that I came not, but that being subject to the
Spirit I obeyed Him. Didst mark again his accustomed logic?<note place="end" n="500" id="v.iii-p49.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p50"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.iii-p50.1">σύνηθες θεώρημα</span>.</p></note>  That by
which they thought to prove that “he purposed according to the
flesh,” namely, the non-fulfilment of his promise, he uses as the
special proof that he purposed according to the Spirit, and that
the contrary had been purposing according to the flesh. What
then? saith one: was it not with the Spirit that he promised what
he did? By no means. For I have already said that Paul did not
foreknow every thing that was to happen or was expedient. And it
is for this reason that he says in the former Epistle, “that ye
may set me forward on my journey whithersoever I go;”
(<scripRef passage="1 Cor. xvi. 6" id="v.iii-p50.2" parsed="|1Cor|16|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.16.6">1 Cor. xvi. 6</scripRef>.) entertaining this very
fear that after he had said, ‘into Judæa,’ he might be
compelled to go elsewhither; but now when his intention had been
frustrated, he says it, “And of you be set forward on my journey
unto Judæa.” So much as was of love, he states, namely, the
coming to them; but that which had no reference to them, his going,
namely, from them into Judæa, he doth not add definitely. When
however he had been proved wrong<note place="end" n="501" id="v.iii-p50.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p51"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.iii-p51.1">ἐ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.iii-p51.2">λήκεγκται</span>.</p></note>, he afterwards says here boldly,
“toward Judæa.” And this too befel for good, lest any among
them should conceive of them (the Apostles, <scripRef passage="Acts xiv. 13" id="v.iii-p51.3" parsed="|Acts|14|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.14.13">Acts xiv. 13</scripRef>.) more highly than they
deserved. For if in the face of these things they wished to
sacrifice bulls to them, upon what impiety would they not have
driven, had they not given many instances of human weakness? And
why marvel if he knew not all things that were to happen, seeing
that ofttimes he even in prayers knoweth not what is expedient.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iii-p52">“For,” saith he “we know not what we should
pray for as we ought.” And that he may not seem to be speaking
modestly, he not only saith this, but instances wherein he knew not
in prayers what was expedient. Wherein then was it? When he
entreated to be delivered from his trials, saying, “There was
given to me a <pb n="289" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_289.html" id="v.iii-Page_289" />thorn in the
flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet me. Concerning this thing I
besought the Lord thrice. And he said unto me, My grace is
sufficient for thee: for My power is made perfect in
weakness.” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. xii. 7-9" id="v.iii-p52.1" parsed="|2Cor|12|7|12|9" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.12.7-2Cor.12.9">2 Cor.
xii. 7–9</scripRef>.) Seest thou
how he knew not to ask what was expedient, and so although he asked
often he obtained not.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iii-p53"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 1.18" id="v.iii-p53.1" parsed="|2Cor|1|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.1.18">Ver. 18</scripRef>. “But as God is
faithful, our word toward you was<note place="end" n="502" id="v.iii-p53.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p54"> [The later critics have the present “is.”
C.]</p></note> not yea and nay.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iii-p55">He skillfully overturns a rising objection. For
one might say, If after having promised, thou hast put off coming,
and yea is not yea, and nay nay, with thee, but what thou sayest
now thou unsayest afterwards, as thou didst in the case of this
Journey: woe is unto us, if all this were the case in the
Preaching too. Now lest they should have these thoughts and be
troubled thereat, he says, “But as God is faithful, our word
toward you was not yea and nay.” This, saith he, was not the
case in the Preaching, but only in our travels and journeyings;
whereas whatever things we have said in our preaching, these abide
steadfast and unmoveable, (for he calleth his preaching here,
“word.”)  Then he bringeth proof of this that cannot be
gainsaid, by referring all to God. What he saith is this; ‘the
promise of my coming was my own and I gave that promise from
myself: but the preaching is not my own, nor of man, but of God,
and what is of God it is impossible should lie.’ Whereupon also
he said, “God is faithful,” that is, “true.” ‘Mistrust
not then what is from Him, for there is nought of man in it.’</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iii-p56">[4.] And seeing he had said “word,” he adds
what follows to explain what kind of word he means. Of what kind
then is it?</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iii-p57"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 1.19" id="v.iii-p57.1" parsed="|2Cor|1|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.1.19">Ver. 19</scripRef>. “For the Son of God,”
saith he, “Who was preached among you by us, even by me, and
Silvanus, and Timothy, was not yea and nay.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iii-p58">For on this account he brings before them the
company of the teachers also, as thence too giving credibility to
the testimony by those who taught, and not who heard it only. And
yet they were disciples; however in his modesty he counts them as
in the rank of teachers. But what is, “was not yea and
nay?” I have never, he saith, unsaid what before I said in the
Preaching. My discourse to you was not now this, now that. For
this is not of faith, but of an erring mind.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iii-p59">“But in Him was the yea.” That is, just as I
said, the word abideth unshaken and steadfast.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iii-p60"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 1.20" id="v.iii-p60.1" parsed="|2Cor|1|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.1.20">Ver. 20</scripRef>. “For how many soever be
the promises of God,” in Him is the yea, and in Him the Amen,
unto the glory of God by us.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iii-p61">What is this, “how many soever the promises
of God?” The Preaching promised many things; and these many
things they proffered and preached. For they discoursed of being
raised again, and of being taken up, and of incorruption, and of
those great rewards and unspeakable goods. As to these promises
then, he saith that they abide immoveable, and in them is no yea
and nay, that is, the things spoken were not now true, and now
false, as was the case about my being with you, but always true.
And first indeed he contends for the articles<note place="end" n="503" id="v.iii-p61.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p62"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.iii-p62.1">δογμάτων</span>.</p></note> of the faith, and the word
concerning Christ, saying, “My word” and my preaching, “was
not yea and nay;” next, for the promises “for how many soever
be the promises, of God, in Him is the yea.” But if the things
He promised are sure and He will certainly give them, much more is
He Himself and the word concerning Him, sure, and it can not be
said that He is now, and now is not, but He “always” is, and is
the same. But what is, “In Him is the yea, and the Amen.”
He signifies that which shall certainly be. For in Him, not in
man, the promises have their being and fulfilment. Fear not,
therefore; for it is not man so that thou shouldest mistrust; but
it is God Who both said and fulfilleth. “Unto the glory of God
through us.” What is, “unto [His] glory through us?” He
fulfilleth them by us, that is, and<note place="end" n="504" id="v.iii-p62.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p63"> Ben. omits “and.”</p></note> by His benefits towards us unto His
glory; for this is “for the glory of God.” But if they be for
the glory of God, they will certainly come to pass. For His own
glory He will not think little of, even did He think little of our
salvation. But as it is, He thinketh not little of our salvation
either, both because He loveth mankind exceedingly, and because our
salvation is bound up with His glory from these things accruing.
So that if the promises are for His glory, our salvation also will
certainly follow; to which also, in the Epistle to the Ephesians,
he reverteth continually, saying, “to the maintenance of His
glory<note place="end" n="505" id="v.iii-p63.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p64"> Rec. text, <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.iii-p64.1">εἰς ἀπολύτρωσιν

down this, and shows the necessity of this result. And in this
regard he here saith, that His promises lie not: for they not
only save us, but also glorify Him. Dwell not on this therefore
that they were promised by us; and so doubt. For they are not
fulfilled by us, but by Him. Yea, and the promises were by Him;
for we spoke not to you our own words, but His.</p>

from the faith which is in Christ;) and He that anointed us and
gave the Spirit in our hearts, how shall He not give us the future
things?</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iii-p67">For if He gave the principles and the

“much more will He who gave these supply these also.”</p></note> supply those. And if to such as
were enemies he gave these, much more when now made friends will He
“freely give” to them those. Wherefore He said not simply
“the Spirit,” but named “earnest,” that from this thou
mightest have a good hope of the whole as well. For did He not
purpose to give the whole, He would never have chosen to give
“the earnest” and to waste it without object or result. And
observe Paul’s candor. For why need I say, saith he, that the
truth of the promises standeth not in us? The fact of your
standing unwavering and fixed is not in us, but this too is of God;
“for” saith he, “He who stablisheth us is God.” It is not
we who strengthen you: for even we also need Him that
stablisheth. So then let none imagine that the Preaching is
hazardous in us. He hath undertaken the whole, He cared for the
whole.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iii-p70">And what is, “anointed,” and
“sealed?” Gave the Spirit by Whom He did both these things,
making at once prophets and priests and kings, for in old times
these three sorts were anointed. But we have now not one of these

kingdom and are made priests by offering our bodies for a
sacrifice, (for, saith he, “present your members<note place="end" n="508" id="v.iii-p70.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p71"> <scripRef passage="Rom. 12. 1" id="v.iii-p71.1" parsed="|Rom|12|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.12.1">Rom. 12.

unto us.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iii-p72">[5.] And in another way too we become
kings: if we have the mind to get dominion over our unruly
thoughts, for that such an one is a king and more than he who
weareth the diadem, I will now make plain to you. He hath many
armies, but we again have thoughts exceeding them in number; for it
is impossible to number the infinite multitude of the thoughts
within us. Nor is their multitude all that one is to consider,
but also that in this multitude of thoughts, there are many
generals, and colonels, and captains, and archers, and slingers.
What else makes a king? His apparel? But this one too is
arrayed in a better and braver robe, which neither doth moth devour
nor age impair. A crown too he hath of curious workmanship<note place="end" n="509" id="v.iii-p72.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p73"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.iii-p73.1">ποὶκιλον</span>.</p></note>, that of
glory, that of the tender mercies of God. For saith [the
Psalmist], “Bless the Lord, O my soul, that crowneth thee with
pity and tender mercies.” (<scripRef passage="Ps. ciii. 2, 4" id="v.iii-p73.2" parsed="|Ps|103|2|0|0;|Ps|103|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.103.2 Bible:Ps.103.4">Ps. ciii. 2, 4</scripRef>.) Again, that of glory:

grace: “For thou shalt receive a crown of grace upon thy

thou this diadem of many wreaths, and surpassing the other in
grace. But let us institute anew and from the beginning a
stricter inquiry into the condition of these kings. That king
hath dominion over his guards, and issues orders to all, and all
obey and serve him; but here I show you greater authority. For
the number here is as great or even greater: it remains to
inquire into their obedience. And bring me not forth those that
have ruled amiss<note place="end" n="510" id="v.iii-p73.6"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p74"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.iii-p74.1">εκπεσόντας</span>.</p></note>, since I too
bring those that have been driven from their kingdom and murdered
by their very body guards. Let us then bring forth these
instances, but seek for those of either kind who have ordered well
their kingdom. And do thou put forward whom thou wilt. I oppose
unto thee the patriarch against all. For when he was commanded to
sacrifice his son, consider how many thoughts then rose up against
him. Nevertheless, he brought all under submission, and all
trembled before him more than before a king his guards; and with a
look only he stilled them all and not one of them dared so much as
mutter; but down they bowed and as unto a king gave place, one and
all, though much exasperated and exceeding relentless. For even
the heads of spears raised upright by many soldiers are not as
fearful as were then those fearful thoughts, armed not with spears,
but what is harder<note place="end" n="511" id="v.iii-p74.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p75"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.iii-p75.1">χαλεπώτερον</span>.</p></note> to deal with than many spears, the
sympathy of nature!  Wherefore they had power to pierce his soul
more than sharpened spear point. For never spear could be so
sharp as were the goads of those thoughts, which, sharpened and
upraised from beneath, from his affections, were piercing through
and through the mind of that righteous man. For here there needs
time and purpose and a stroke and pain, and then death follows; but
there, there needed none of these, so much were the wounds speedier
and acuter. But still though so many thoughts were then in arms
against him, there was a deep calm, and they stood all in fair
array; adorning rather than daunting him. See him at least
stretching out the knife, and set forth as many as thou
<pb n="291" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_291.html" id="v.iii-Page_291" />wilt, kings, emperors, Cæsars,
yet shalt thou tell of nought like this, have no like mien to point
to, so noble, so worthy of the heavens. For that righteous man
erected a trophy at that movement over the most arbitrary of
tyrannies. For nothing is so tyrannical as nature; and find ten
thousand tyrannicides, one like this shalt thou never show us.
For it was the triumph in that moment of an angel, not a man. For
consider. Nature was dashed to the ground with all her weapons,
with all her host: and he stood with outstretched hand, grasping
not a crown, but a knife more glorious than any crown, and the
throng of angels applauded, and God from heaven proclaimed him

thence also he received that proclamation. (<scripRef passage="Philip. iii. 20" id="v.iii-p76.1" parsed="|Phil|3|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Phil.3.20">Philip. iii. 20</scripRef>.) What could be more
glorious than this? rather, what trophy could ever be equal to
it? For if on occasion of a wrestler’s success, not a herald
below but the king above should have risen up and himself
proclaimed the Olympic Victor, would not this have seemed to him
more glorious than the crown, and have turned the gaze of the whole
theatre upon him? When then no mortal king, but God Himself, not
in this theatre but in the theatre of the universe, in the assembly
of the angels, the archangels, proclaimeth his name with uplifted
voice shouting from heaven, tell me what place shall we assign to
this holy man?</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iii-p77">[6.] But if you will, let us listen too to the
voice itself. What then was the voice? “Abraham, Abraham, lay
not thy hand upon Isaac, neither do thou any thing unto him. For
now I know that thou fearest God, and hast not spared thy son, thy
well-beloved, for My sake.” (<scripRef passage="Gen. xxii. 11, 12" id="v.iii-p77.1" parsed="|Gen|22|11|22|12" osisRef="Bible:Gen.22.11-Gen.22.12">Gen. xxii. 11, 12</scripRef>.) What is this? He
that knoweth all things before they are, did He now know!  And yet
even to man the Patriarch’s<note place="end" n="512" id="v.iii-p77.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p78"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.iii-p78.1">τἀνδρός</span>.</p></note> fear of God was evident: so many
proofs had he given that his heart was right toward God<note place="end" n="513" id="v.iii-p78.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p79"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.iii-p79.1">τῆς περὶ τὸν Θεὸν

said to him, “Get thee out of thy country, and from thy
kindred;” (<scripRef passage="Gen. xii. 1" id="v.iii-p79.2" parsed="|Gen|12|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.12.1">Gen.
xii. 1</scripRef>.) when for His
sake and the honor due to Him he relinquished to his sister’s son
his priority; when He delivered him out of so great perils; when He
bade him go into Egypt, and on his wife’s being taken from him,
he repined not, and more instances besides; and as I said, from
these things even man would have learned the Patriarch’s fear of
God, much more than God Who waiteth not for the acts to know the
end. And how too justified he him, if He knew not? For it is
written, “Abraham believed, and it was counted unto him for
righteousness.” (<scripRef passage="Gen. xv. 6; Rom. iv. 3" id="v.iii-p79.3" parsed="|Gen|15|6|0|0;|Rom|4|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.15.6 Bible:Rom.4.3">Gen.
xv. 6; Rom. iv. 3</scripRef>.)</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iii-p80">What then means this, “Now I know?” The Syriac
hath, “Now thou hast made known;” that is, to men. For I knew
of old, even before all those commandments. And why, to men even,
“now?” for were not those acts enough to prove his mind was
right toward God? They were enough indeed, but this one so much
greater than them all that they appear nothing beside it. As
exalting then this good work and showing its superiority to all, He
so spake. For of things which exceed and surpass all that went
before, most men are wont to speak so: for instance, if one
receive from another a gift greater than any former one, he often
says, “Now I know that such an one loves me,” not hereby
meaning that he knew not in the time past, but as intending to
declare what is now given to be greater than all. So also God,
speaking after the manner of men, saith, “Now I know,”
intending only to mark the exceeding greatness of the exploit; not
that He “then” came to know either his fear or the greatness of
it. For when He saith, “Come, let Us go down and see,” (<scripRef passage="Gen. xi. 7; xviii. 21" id="v.iii-p80.1" parsed="|Gen|11|7|0|0;|Gen|18|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.11.7 Bible:Gen.18.21">Gen. xi. 7; xviii. 21</scripRef>.) He saith it not as needing
to go down, (for He both filleth all things and knoweth all things
certainly,) but to teach us not to give sentence lightly. And
when He saith, “The Lord looked down from Heaven:” (<scripRef passage="Ps. xiv. 2" id="v.iii-p80.2" parsed="|Ps|14|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.14.2">Ps. xiv. 2</scripRef>.) it describeth His
perfect knowledge by a metaphor taken from men. So also here He
saith, “Now I know,” to declare this to be greater than all
which had preceded it. Of this itself too He furnisheth proof by
adding, “Because thou sparedst not thy son, thy well-beloved, for
My sake; He saith not “thy son” only, but yet more, “thy
well-beloved.” For it was not nature only, but also parental
fondness, which having both by natural disposition and by the great
goodness of his child, he yet dared in him to spurn<note place="end" n="514" id="v.iii-p80.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p81"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.iii-p81.1">κατετόλμησεν</span>.</p></note>. And if
about worthless children parents are not easily indifferent, but
mourn even for them; when it is his son, his only-begotten, and his
well-beloved, even Isaac, and the father himself is on the point of
immolating him; who can describe the excessiveness of such
philosophy? This exploit outshineth thousands of diadems and
crowns innumerable. For the wearer of that crown, both death
ofttimes assaileth and annoyeth, and before death, assaults of
circumstances without number; but this diadem shall no one have
strength to take from him that weareth it; no not even after death;
neither of his own household, nor of strangers. And let me point
you out the costliest stone in this diadem. For as a costly
stone, so this comes at the end and clasps it. What then is this?
the words, “for My sake?” for not herein is the marvel, that he
spared not, but that it was “for His sake.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iii-p82"><pb n="292" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_292.html" id="v.iii-Page_292" />Oh!
blessed right hand, of what a knife was it accounted worthy? oh!
wondrous knife, of what a right hand was it accounted worthy? Oh!
wondrous knife, for what a purpose was it prepared? to what an
office did it serve? to what a type did it minister? How was it
bloodied? how was it not bloodied? For I know not what to say, so
awful was that mystery. It touched not the neck of the child, nor
passed through the throat of that holy one: nor was crimsoned
with the blood of the righteous; rather it both touched, and passed
through, and was crimsoned, and was bathed in it, yet was not
bathed. Perchance I seem to you beside myself, uttering such
contradictions. For, in truth, I am beside myself, with the
thought of the wondrous deed of that righteous man; but I utter no
contradictions. For indeed the righteous man’s hand thrust it
in the throat of the lad, but God’s Hand suffered it not, so
thrust, to be stained with blood of the lad. For it was not
Abraham alone that held it back, but God also: and he by his
purpose gave the stroke, God by His voice restrained it. For the
same voice both armed and disarmed<note place="end" n="515" id="v.iii-p82.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p83"> Ben. “checked.”</p></note> that right hand, which, marshalled
under God, as if under a leader, performed all things at His beck,
and all were ministered at His voice. For observe; He said,
“Slay,” and straightway it was armed: He said, “Slay
not,” and straightway it was disarmed: for every thing [before]
had been fully prepared.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iii-p84">And now God showed the soldier and general to
the whole world; this crowned victor to the theatre of the angels;
this priest, this king, crowned with that knife beyond a diadem,

the adversary; so also God, by the purpose, the attitude, the
bearing only of that righteous man, dismayed and routed the common
enemy of us all, the Devil. For I deem that even he then shrunk
away aghast. But if any one say, ‘And why did he not suffer
that right hand to be bathed, and then forthwith raise him up after
being sacrificed?’ Because God might not accept such bloody
offerings; such a table were that of avenging demons. But here
two things were displayed, both the loving kindness of the Master,
and the faithfulness of the servant. And before, indeed, he went
out from his country: but then he abandoned even nature.
Wherefore also he received his principal with usury: and very
reasonably. For he chose to lose the name of father, to show
himself a faithful servant. Wherefore he became not a father
only, but also a priest; and because for God’s sake he gave up
his own, therefore also did God give him with these His own
besides. When then enemies devise mischief, He allows it to come
even to the trial, and then works miracles; as in the case of the
furnace and the lions; (<scripRef passage="Dan. 3; 6" id="v.iii-p85.5" parsed="|Dan|3|0|0|0;|Dan|6|0|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Dan.3 Bible:Dan.6">Dan. iii. and vi</scripRef>.) but when Himself
biddeth, readiness<note place="end" n="517" id="v.iii-p85.6"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p86"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.iii-p86.1">μέχρι προθυμίας</span>.</p></note> attained, He stayeth His bidding.
What then, I ask, was wanting further in this noble deed? For did
Abraham foreknow what would happen? Did he bargain for the mercy
of God? For even though he were a prophet, yet the prophet
knoweth not all things. So the actual sacrifice afterwards was
superfluous and unworthy of God. And if it was fit he should
learn that God was able to raise from the dead, by the womb he had
learnt this much more marvellously, or rather he learnt it even
before that proof, for he had faith.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iii-p87">[7.] Do not then only admire this righteous
man, but also imitate him, and when thou seest him amid so great
uproar and surge of waves sailing as in a calm, take thou in hand

him to dismay him, when he heard the lad say, “My father, where

up armed not with iron, but with darts of flame; and piercing into
and cutting him through on every side. If even now many, and
those not parents, are broken down<note place="end" n="519" id="v.iii-p88.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p89"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.iii-p89.1">κατακλῶνται</span>.</p></note>, and would have wept, did they not
know the end: and many, I see, do weep, though they know it; what
must it be thought he would feel, who begat, who nurtured him, in
old age had him, had him only, him such an one, who sees, who hears
him, and is presently about to slay him? What intelligence in the
words!  What meekness in the question!  Who then is here at
work? The Devil that he might set nature in a flame? God
forbid! but God, the more to prove the golden soul of the righteous
man. For when indeed the wife of Job speaks, a Devil is at
work. For of such sort the advice is. But this one uttereth
nothing blasphemous, but what is both very devout and thoughtful;
and great the grace that overspread the words, much the honey that
dropped therefrom, flowing from a calm and gentle soul. Even a
heart of stone these words were enough to soften. But they turned
not aside, nay, shook not that adamant. Nor said he, ‘Why
callest thou him father, who in a little while will not be thy
father, yea, who <pb n="293" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_293.html" id="v.iii-Page_293" />hath
already lost that title of honor?’ And why doth the lad ask the
question? Not of impertinence merely, not of curiosity, but as
anxious about what was proposed. For he reflected that had his
father not meant to make him a partner in what was done, he would
not have left the servants below, and taken him only with him.
For this reason, too, surely, it is that when they were alone, then
he asks him, when none heard what was said. So great was the
judgment of the lad. Are ye not all warmed towards him, both men
and women? Doth not each one of you mentally infold and kiss the
child, and marvel at his judgment; and venerate the piety which,
when he was both bound and laid on the wood, made him not be
dismayed nor struggle nor accuse his father as mad; but he was even
bound and lifted up and laid upon it, and endured all in silence,
like a lamb, yea, rather like the common Lord of all. For of Him
he both imitated the gentleness, and kept to the type. For “He
was led like a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep dumb before
his shearer.” (<scripRef passage="Is. liii. 7" id="v.iii-p89.2" parsed="|Isa|53|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.53.7">Is.
liii. 7</scripRef>.) And yet Isaac
spake; for his Lord spake also. How dumb then? This meaneth, he
spake nothing wilful or harsh, but all was sweet and mild, and the
words more than the silence manifested his gentleness. For Christ
also said, “If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil; but
if well, why smitest thou Me?” (<scripRef passage="John xviii. 23" id="v.iii-p89.3" parsed="|John|18|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.18.23">John xviii. 23</scripRef>.) and manifested His
gentleness more than if He had held His peace. And as this one
speaketh with his father from the altar, so too doth He from the
Cross, saying, “Father, forgive them, for they know not what they
do.” What then said the Patriarch? (<scripRef passage="Gen. 22.8" id="v.iii-p89.4" parsed="|Gen|22|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.22.8">ver. 8</scripRef>.) “God will provide

judgment was the child even in the very bloom of youth. Seest
thou the king, over how many armies, in how many battles which
beset him, he hath been victorious? For the barbarians were not
so fearful to the city of Jerusalem when they assaulted her
oftentimes, as were to this man the thoughts on every side
besieging him: but still he overcame all. Wouldest thou see the
priest also? The instance is at hand. For when thou hast seen
him with fire and a knife; and standing over an altar, what
doubtest thou after as to his priesthood? But if thou wouldest
see the sacrifice also, lo, here a twofold one. For he offered a
son, he offered also a ram, yea, more and above all, his own
will. And with the blood of the lamb he consecrated his right
hand<note place="end" n="522" id="v.iii-p91.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii-p92"> In Levitical consecrations, the thumb of the

sacrifice of his son, his soul. Thus was he ordained a priest, by
the blood of his only-begotten, by the sacrifice of a lamb; for the
priests also were consecrated by the blood of the victims which
were offered to God. Wouldest thou see the prophet also? It is
written, “Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day, and he saw

<p class="c27" id="v.iv-p3">But I call God for a witness upon my soul, that to

<p class="c24" id="v.iv-p4"><span class="c18" id="v.iv-p4.1">What</span> sayest thou, O blessed
Paul? To spare them thou camest not to Corinth? Surely thou
presentest us with something of a contradiction. For a little
above thou saidst that thou therefore camest not, because thou
purposest not according to the flesh nor art thine own master, but
art led about every where by the authority of the Spirit, and didst
set forth thine afflictions. But here thou sayest it was thine
own act that thou camest not, and not from the authority of the
Spirit; for he saith, “To spare you I forbare to come to
Corinth.” What then is one to say? either, that this too was
itself of the Spirit, and that he himself wished to come but the
Spirit suggested to him not to do so, urging the motive of sparing
them; or else, that he is speaking of some other coming, and would
signify that before he wrote the former Epistle he was minded to
come, and for love’s sake restrained himself lest he should find
them yet unamended. Perhaps also, after the second Epistle though
the Spirit no longer forbade him to go, he involuntarily stayed
away for this reason. And this suspicion is the more probable,
that in the first instance the Spirit forbade him: but afterwards
upon his own conviction also that this was more advisable, he
stayed away.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iv-p5">And observe, I pray you, how he remembers again his
own custom, (which I shall never cease to observe,) of making what
seems against him tell in his favor. For since it was natural for
them to respect this and say, ‘It was because thou hatedst us,
thou wouldest not come unto us,’ he shows on the contrary, that
the cause for which he would not come was that he loved them.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iv-p6">What is the expression, “to spare you?”
I heard, he saith, that some among you had committed fornication; I
would not therefore come and make you sorry: for had I come, I
must needs have enquired into the matter, and prosecuted and
punished, and exacted justice from many. I judged it then better
to be away and to give opportunity for repentance, than to be with
you and to prosecute, and be still more incensed. For towards the
end of this Epistle he hath plainly declared it, saying, “I fear
lest when I come, my God should humble me before you, and that I
should mourn for many of them that have sinned heretofore, and
repented not of the lasciviousness and uncleanness<note place="end" n="526" id="v.iv-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.iv-p7"> Rec. text, “<i>uncleanness, and

committed.” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. xii. 20, 21" id="v.iv-p7.1" parsed="|2Cor|12|20|12|21" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.12.20-2Cor.12.21">2
Cor. xii. 20, 21</scripRef>.) This therefore here
also he intimates, and he saith it indeed as in his own defence;
yet rebuketh<note place="end" n="527" id="v.iv-p7.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.iv-p8"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.iv-p8.1">ἐ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.iv-p8.2">πιστύφει</span>.</p></note> them most
severely and putteth them in fear; for he implied that they were
open to punishment, and will also have somewhat to suffer, unless
they be quickly reformed. And he says the same thing again at the
end of the Epistle thus; “If I come again, I will not spare.”
(<scripRef passage="2 Cor. xiii. 2" id="v.iv-p8.3" parsed="|2Cor|13|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.13.2">2 Cor. xiii. 2</scripRef>.) Only there he says
it more plainly: but here, as it was the proem, he does not say
it so but in a repressed<note place="end" n="528" id="v.iv-p8.4"><p class="endnote" id="v.iv-p9"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.iv-p9.1">ὐ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.iv-p9.2">πεσταλμένως</span>.</p></note> tone; nor is he content even with
this, but he softens it down, applying a corrective. For seeing
the expression was that of one asserting great authority, (for a
man spares those whom he has also power to punish,) in order to
relieve it, and draw a shade over what seems harsh, he
saith,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iv-p10"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 1.24" id="v.iv-p10.1" parsed="|2Cor|1|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.1.24">Ver. 24</scripRef>. “Not for that we have
lordship over your faith.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iv-p11">That is, I did not therefore say, “To spare you I
came not,” as lording it over you. Again, he said not you, but
“your faith,” which was at once gentler and truer. For him
that hath no mind to believe, who hath power to compel?</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iv-p12">“But are helpers of your joy.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iv-p13">For since, saith he, your joy is ours, I came not,
that I might not plunge you into sorrow and increase my own
despondency; but I stayed away that ye being reformed by the threat
might be made glad. For we do every thing in order to your joy,
and give diligence in this behalf, because we are ourselves
partakers of it. “For by faith ye stand.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iv-p14">Behold him again speaking repressedly. For he was
afraid to rebuke them again; since he had handled them severely in
the former Epistle, and they had made some reformation. And if,
now that they were reformed, they again re<pb n="295" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_295.html" id="v.iv-Page_295" />ceived the same reproof, this was
likely to throw them back. Whence this Epistle is much gentler

Chrysostom omits <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.iv-p16.1">τοῦτο</span>.</p></note> for myself
that I would not come again to you with sorrow.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iv-p17">The expression “again” proves that he had
already been made sorry from thence, and whilst he seems to be
speaking in his own defence he covertly rebukes them. Now if they
had both already made him sorry and were about again to make him
sorry, consider how great the displeasure was likely to be. But
he saith not thus, ‘Ye made me sorry,’ but turns the expression
differently yet implying the very same thing thus, ‘For this
cause I came not that I might not make you sorry:’ which has
the same force as what I said, but is more palatable.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iv-p18">[2.] <scripRef passage="2 Cor. 2.2" id="v.iv-p18.1" parsed="|2Cor|2|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.2.2">Ver. 2</scripRef>. “For if I make you sorry,
who then is he that maketh me glad, but he that is made sorry by
me?”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iv-p19">What is this consequence? A very just one
indeed. For observe, I would not, he saith, come unto you, lest I
should increase your sorrow, rebuking, showing anger and disgust.
Then seeing that even this was strong and implied accusation that
they so lived as to make Paul sorry, he applies a corrective in the
words, “For if I make you sorry, who then is he that maketh me
glad, but he that is made sorry by me?”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iv-p20">What he saith is of this kind. ‘Even though I
were to be in sorrow, being compelled to rebuke you and to see you
sorry, still nevertheless this very thing would have made me
glad. For this is a proof of the greatest love, that you hold me
in such esteem as to be hurt at my being displeased with
you.’</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iv-p21">Behold too his prudence. Their doing what all
disciples do, namely, smarting and feeling it when rebuked, he
produces as an instance of their gratifying him; for, saith he,
‘No man maketh me so glad as he that giveth heed to my words, and
is sorry when he seeth me angry.’</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iv-p22">Yet what followed naturally<note place="end" n="530" id="v.iv-p22.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.iv-p23"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.iv-p23.1">τὸ ἀκόλουθον</span>.</p></note> was to say, ‘For if I make you
sorry, who then is he that can make you glad?’ But he doth not
say this, but turns his speech back again, dealing tenderly with
them, and says, ‘Though I make you sorry, even herein ye bestow
on me a very great favor in that ye are hurt at what I
say.’</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iv-p24"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 2.3" id="v.iv-p24.1" parsed="|2Cor|2|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.2.3">Ver. 3</scripRef>.
“And I wrote this very thing unto you.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iv-p25">What? That for this cause I came not, to spare
you. When wrote he? In the former Epistle when he said, “I do
not wish to see you now by the way?” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. xvi. 7" id="v.iv-p25.1" parsed="|1Cor|16|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.16.7">1 Cor. xvi. 7</scripRef>.) I think not; but in this
Epistle when he said, “Lest when I come again, my God should
humble me before you.” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. xii. 21" id="v.iv-p25.2" parsed="|2Cor|12|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.12.21">2 Cor. xii. 21</scripRef>.) I have written then
towards the end this same, saith he, “lest when I come, my God
will humble me, and I should mourn for many of them that have
sinned heretofore.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iv-p26">But why didst thou write? “Lest when I came I
should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice, having
confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all?” For
whereas he said he was made glad by their sorrow, and this was too
arrogant and harsh, again he gave it a different turn and softened
it by what he subjoined. For, he saith, I therefore wrote unto
you before, that I might not with anguish find you unreformed; and
I said this, “lest I should have sorrow,” out of regard not to
my own interest but yours. For I know that if ye see me rejoicing
ye rejoice, and if ye behold me sad ye are sad. Observe therefore
again the connection of what he said; for so his words will be more
easy to understand. I came not, he says, lest I should cause you
sorrow when finding you unreformed. And this I did, not studying
my own advantage, but yours. For as to myself, when ye are made
sorry I receive no little pleasure, seeing that you care so much
about me as to be sorry and distressed at my being displeased.
“For who is he that maketh me glad, but he that is made sorry by
me.” However, though it be so with myself, yet because I study
your advantage, I wrote this same thing to you that I might not be
made sorry, herein also again studying not my advantage, but yours;
for I know, that were ye to see me sad, ye also would be sorry; as
also ye are glad when ye see me rejoicing. Observe now his
prudence. He said, I came not, that I might not make you sorry;
although, saith he, this makes me glad. Then, lest he should seem
to take pleasure in their pain, he saith, In this respect I am glad
inasmuch as I make you feel, for in another respect I am sorry in
that I am compelled to make those sorry who love me so much, not
only by this rebuke, but also by being myself in sorrow and by this
means causing you fresh sorrow.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iv-p27">But observe how he puts this so as to mingle
praise; saying, “from them of whom I ought to rejoice,” for
these are the words of one testifying kindred and much tender
affection; as if one were speaking of sons on whom he had bestowed
many benefits and for whom he had toiled. If then for this I
write and come not; it is with weighty meaning<note place="end" n="531" id="v.iv-p27.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.iv-p28"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.iv-p28.1">μέγα τι οἰκονομῶν</span>.</p></note> I come not, and not because I feel
hate or aversion, but rather exceeding love.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iv-p29">[3.] Next, whereas he said, he that makes me sorry
makes me glad; lest they should say ‘this then is what thou
studiest, that thou mightest <pb n="296" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_296.html" id="v.iv-Page_296" />be
made glad and mightest exhibit to all the extent of thy power;’
he added,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iv-p30"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 2.4" id="v.iv-p30.1" parsed="|2Cor|2|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.2.4">Ver. 4</scripRef>.
“For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you
with many tears, not that ye should be made sorry, but that ye
might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iv-p31">What more tenderly affectioned than this man’s
spirit is? for he showeth himself to have been not less pained than
they who had sinned, but even much more. For he saith not “out
of affliction” merely, but “out of much,” nor “with
tears,” but “with many tears” and “anguish of heart,”
that is, I was suffocated, I was choked with despondency; and when
I could no longer endure the cloud of despondency, “I wrote unto
you: not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the
love,” saith he, “which I have more abundantly unto you.”
And yet what naturally followed was to say, not that ye might be
grieved, but that ye might be corrected: (for indeed with this
purpose he wrote.) This however he doth not say, but, (more to
sweeten his words, and win them to a greater affection,) he puts
this for it, showing that he doth all from love. And he saith not
simply “the love,” but “which I have more abundantly unto
you.” For hereby also he desires to win them, by showing that
he loveth them more than all and feels towards them as to chosen
disciples. Whence he saith, “Even if I be not an Apostle unto
others, yet at least I am to you;” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. ix. 2" id="v.iv-p31.1" parsed="|1Cor|9|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.9.2">1 Cor. ix. 2</scripRef>.) and, “Though ye have
many<note place="end" n="532" id="v.iv-p31.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.iv-p32"> Rec. text <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.iv-p32.1">μυρίους</span>.</p></note> tutors, yet
have ye not many fathers;” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. iv. 15" id="v.iv-p32.2" parsed="|1Cor|4|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.4.15">1 Cor. iv. 15</scripRef>.) and again, “By the grace
of God we behaved ourselves in the world, and more abundantly to
you ward;” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. i. 12" id="v.iv-p32.3" parsed="|2Cor|1|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.1.12">2 Cor. i.
12</scripRef>.) and farther on,
“Though the more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved;”
and here “Which I have more abundantly unto you;” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. xii. 15" id="v.iv-p32.4" parsed="|2Cor|12|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.12.15">2 Cor. xii. 15</scripRef>.) So that if my words
were full of anger, yet out of much love and sadness was the anger;
and whilst writing the Epistle, I suffered, I was pained, not
because ye had sinned only, but also because I was compelled to
make you sorry. And this itself was out of love. Just as a
father whose legitimate<note place="end" n="533" id="v.iv-p32.5"><p class="endnote" id="v.iv-p33"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.iv-p33.1">γνήσιος</span>.</p></note> son is afflicted with a gangrene,
being compelled to use the knife and cautery, is pained on both
accounts, that he is diseased and that he is compelled to use the
knife to him. So that what ye consider a sign of hating you was
indeed a sign of excessive love. And if to have made you sorry
was out of love, much more my gladness at that sorrow.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iv-p34">[4.] Having made this defence of himself, (for he
frequently defends himself, without being ashamed; for if God doth
so, saying, “O My people, what have I done unto thee?” (<scripRef passage="Micah vi. 3" id="v.iv-p34.1" parsed="|Mic|6|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Mic.6.3">Micah vi. 3</scripRef>.) much more might Paul,)
having, I say, made this defence of himself, and being now about to
pass on to the plea for him who had committed fornication, in order
that they might not be distracted as at receiving contradictory
commands, nor take to cavilling because he it was who both then was
angry and was now commanding to forgive him, see how he provided<note place="end" n="534" id="v.iv-p34.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.iv-p35"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.iv-p35.1">προῳκονόμησεν</span>.</p></note> for this
beforehand, both by what he has said and what he is going to say.
For what saith he?</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iv-p36"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 2.5" id="v.iv-p36.1" parsed="|2Cor|2|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.2.5">Ver. 5</scripRef>.
“But if any hath caused sorrow, he hath caused sorrow not to
me.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iv-p37">Having first praised them as feeling joy and sorrow
for the same things as himself, he then strikes into the subject of
this person, having said first, “my joy is the joy of you
all.” But if my joy is the joy of you all, need is that you
should also now feel pleasure with me, as ye then were pained with
me: for both in that ye were made sorry, ye made me glad; and now
in that ye rejoice, (if as I suppose ye shall feel pleasure,) ye
will do the same. He said not, my sorrow is the sorrow of you
all; but having established this in the rest of what he said, he
has now put forward that only which he most desired, namely, the
joy: saying, my joy is the joy of you all. Then, he makes
mention also of the former matter, saying,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iv-p38">“But if any hath caused sorrow he hath caused
sorrow not to me, but in part (that I press not too heavily) to you
all.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iv-p39">I know, he saith, that ye shared in my anger and
indignation against him that had committed fornication, and that
what had taken place grieved in part all of you. And therefore
said I “in part,” not as though ye were less hurt than I, but
that I might not weigh down him that had committed fornication.
He did not then grieve me only but you also equally, even though to
spare him I said, “in part.” Seest thou how at once he
moderated their anger, by declaring that they shared also in his
indignation.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iv-p40"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 2.6" id="v.iv-p40.1" parsed="|2Cor|2|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.2.6">Ver. 6</scripRef>.
“Sufficient to such a one is this punishment which was inflicted
by the many.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iv-p41">And he saith not “to him that hath committed
fornication,” but here again “to such a one,” as also in the
former Epistle. Not however for the same reason; but there out of
shame, here out of mercy. Wherefore he no where subsequently so
much as mentions the crime; for it was time now to excuse.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iv-p42"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 2.7" id="v.iv-p42.1" parsed="|2Cor|2|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.2.7">Ver. 7</scripRef>.
“So that contrariwise ye should rather forgive him and comfort
him, lest by any means such a one should be swallowed up with his
overmuch sorrow.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iv-p43">He bids them not only take off the censure; <pb n="297" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_297.html" id="v.iv-Page_297" />but, besides, restores him to
his former estate; for if one let go him that hath been scourged
and heal him not, he hath done nothing. And see how him too he
keeps down lest he should be rendered worse by the forgiveness.
For though he had both confessed and repented, he makes it manifest
that he obtaineth remission not so much by his penitence as by this
free gift. Wherefore he saith, “to forgive<note place="end" n="535" id="v.iv-p43.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.iv-p44"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.iv-p44.1">χαρὶσασθαι</span>.</p></note> him and to comfort him,” and what
follows again makes the same thing plain. ‘For’ saith he,
‘it is not because he is worthy, not because he has shown
sufficient penitence; but because he is weak, it is for this I
request<note place="end" n="536" id="v.iv-p44.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.iv-p45"> Or think it fitting.</p></note> it.’
Whence also he added, “lest by any means such a one should be
swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.” And this is both as
testifying to his deep repentance and as not allowing him to fall
into despair<note place="end" n="537" id="v.iv-p45.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.iv-p46"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.iv-p46.1">ἀ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.iv-p46.2">πονοίαν</span>, which is however seldom used in this
sense by St. Chrysostom.</p></note>.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iv-p47">But what means this, “swallowed up?”
Either doing as Judas did, or even in living becoming worse. For,
saith he, if he should rush away from longer enduring the anguish
of this lengthened censure, perchance also despairing he will
either come to hang himself, or fall into greater crimes
afterwards. One ought then to take steps beforehand<note place="end" n="538" id="v.iv-p47.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.iv-p48"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.iv-p48.1">προκαταλαβεῖν</span>.</p></note>, lest the
sore become too hard to deal with; and lest what we have well done
we lose by want of moderation.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iv-p49">Now this he said, (as I have already observed,) both
to keep him low, and to teach him not to be over-listless after
this restoration. For, not as one who has washed all quite away;
but as fearing lest he should work aught of deeper mischief, I have
received him, he saith. Whence we learn that we must determine
the penance, not only by the nature of the sins, but by the
disposition and habit of them that sin. As the Apostle did in
that instance. For he feared his weakness, and therefore said,
“lest he be swallowed up,” as though by a wild beast, by a
storm, by a billow.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iv-p50"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 2.8" id="v.iv-p50.1" parsed="|2Cor|2|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.2.8">Ver. 8</scripRef>.
“Wherefore I beseech you.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iv-p51">He no longer commands but beseeches, not as a
teacher but as an equal; and having seated them on the judgment
seat he placed himself in the rank of an advocate; for having
succeeded in his object, for joy he adopts without restraint the
tone of supplication. And what can it be that thou beseechest? 
Tell me.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iv-p52">“To confirm your love toward him.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iv-p53">That is, ‘make it strong,’ not simply have
intercourse with him, nor any how. Herein, again, he bears
testimony to their virtue as very great; since they who were so
friendly and so applauded him as even to be puffed up, were so
estranged that Paul takes such pains to make them confirm their
love towards him. Herein is excellence of disciples, herein
excellence of teachers; that they should so obey the rein, he so
manage their motions<note place="end" n="539" id="v.iv-p53.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.iv-p54"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.iv-p54.1">ῥ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.iv-p54.2">υθμιζειν</span>.</p></note>. If this were so even now, they
who sin would not have transgressed senselessly. For one ought
neither to love carelessly, nor to be estranged without some
reason.</p>

might know the proof of you, whether ye are obedient in all
things;” not only in cutting off but also in reuniting. Seest
thou how here again he brings the danger to their doors. For as
when he sinned, he alarmed their minds, except they should cut him
off, saying, “A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump,”
(<scripRef passage="1 Cor. v. 6" id="v.iv-p56.3" parsed="|1Cor|5|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.5.6">1 Cor. v. 6</scripRef>.) and several other things; so
here too again he confronts them with the fear of disobedience, as
good as saying, ‘As then ye had to consult not for him, but for
yourselves too, so now must ye not less for yourselves than for
him; lest ye seem to be of such as love contention and have not
human sensibilities, and not to be in all things obedient. And
hence he saith, “For to this end also did I write to you, that I
might know the proof of you, whether ye are obedient in all
things.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iv-p57">For the former instance might have seemed to
proceed even of envy and malice, but this shows very especially the
obedience to be pure, and whether ye are apt unto loving
kindness. For this is the test of right minded disciples; if they
obey not only when ordered to do certain things, but when the
contrary also. Therefore he said, “in all things,” showing
that if they disobey, they disgrace not him<note place="end" n="541" id="v.iv-p57.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.iv-p58"> The incestuous person.</p></note> so much as themselves, earning the
character of lovers of contention; and he doth this that hence also
he may drive them to obey. Whence also he saith, “For to this
end did I write to you;” and yet he wrote not for this end, but
he saith so in order to win them. For the leading object was the
salvation of that person. But where it does no harm, he also
gratifies them. And by saying, “In all things,” he again
praises them, recalling to memory and bringing forth to view their
former obedience.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iv-p59"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 2.10" id="v.iv-p59.1" parsed="|2Cor|2|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.2.10">Ver. 10</scripRef>.
“To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iv-p60">Seest thou how again he assigns the second part to
himself, showing them as beginning, himself following. This is
the way to soften an exasperated, to compose a contentious
spirit. Then lest he should make them careless, as though they
were arbiters, and they should refuse forgiveness; he again
constrains them <pb n="298" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_298.html" id="v.iv-Page_298" />unto this,
saying, that himself also had forgiven him.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iv-p61">“For what I also have forgiven, if I have forgiven
any thing, for your sakes have I forgiven it.” For, this very
thing I have done for your sakes, he saith. And as when he
commanded them to cut him off, he left not with them the power to
forgive, saying, “I have judged already to deliver such an one
unto Satan,” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. v. 3, 5" id="v.iv-p61.1" parsed="|1Cor|5|3|0|0;|1Cor|5|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.5.3 Bible:1Cor.5.5">1 Cor. v.
3, 5</scripRef>.) and again made
them partners in his decision saying, “ye being gathered together
to deliver him,” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. 5.4,5" id="v.iv-p61.2" parsed="|2Cor|5|4|5|5" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.5.4-2Cor.5.5">ib. 4, 5</scripRef>.) (thereby securing two most
important things, viz., that the sentence should be passed; yet not
without their consent, lest herein he might seem to hurt them;) and
neither himself alone pronounces it, lest they should consider him
self-willed, and themselves to be overlooked, nor yet leaves all to
them, lest when possessed of the power they should deal
treacherously with the offender by unseasonably forgiving him: so
also doth he here, saying, ‘I have already forgiven, who in the
former Epistle had already judged.’ Then lest they should be
hurt, as though overlooked, he adds, “for your sakes.” What
then? did he for men’s sake pardon? No; for on this account he
added, “In the person of Christ.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iv-p62">What is “in the person of Christ?”
Either he means according to [the will of] God, or unto the glory
of Christ.<note place="end" n="542" id="v.iv-p62.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.iv-p63"> [Modern critics understand this phrase
otherwise. They take it as meaning either that the Apostle acted
as Christ’s representative and by his authority (Luther,
Wetstein, <i>et al</i>.), or that he took the course which he did
in the presence of Christ, i.e., as though Christ were looking
on. Either sense is good and suits the connection, but the latter
has commended itself to most expositors, (Calvin, Meyer, Hodge,
Beet, <i>et al</i>.), since nothing could be better adapted to
secure both fidelity and tenderness in administering the discipline
of God’s house than the feeling or rather the conviction that the
eyes of Christ were fixed upon the judges. Calvin thinks such a
sentiment fitted “to incline us to mercy,” but it is not easy
to see why it is not as well suited to make one firm in adherence
to principle. C.]</p></note></p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iv-p65">Seest thou how he both committeth the power to them
and again taketh away that by that he may soften them, by this
eradicate their self will. But this is not all that he provides
for by this, but shows also that should they be disobedient the
harm would reach to all, just as he did at the outset also. For
then too he said, “A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.”

“Lest Satan should get an advantage of us.” And throughout,
he maketh this forgiveness the joint act of himself and them.
Consider it from the first. “But if any,” saith he, “have
caused sorrow he hath caused sorrow not to me, but in part (that I
press not too heavily) to you all.” Then again, “Sufficient
to such a one is this punishment which was” inflicted by the
“many.” This is his own decision and opinion. He rested not
however with this decision, but again makes them partners saying,
“So that contrariwise ye should rather forgive” him “and
comfort” him. “Wherefore I beseech you to confirm your love
towards him.” Having thus again made the whole their act, he
passes to his own authority, saying, “For to this end did I write
unto you, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye are
obedient in all things.” Then, again, he makes the favor
theirs, saying, “To whom ye forgive anything.” Then, his own,
“I” forgive “also:” saying, “if I have forgiven
anything, it is for your sakes.” Then both theirs and his,
“For,” saith he, “if I have forgiven any thing, for your
sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ,” either [that is] for
the glory of Christ, or as though Christ commanding this also,
which was most effectual to prevail with them. For after this
they would have feared not to grant that which tended to His glory
and which He willed. Then again he signifieth the common harm
should they disobey, when he saith, “Lest Satan should get an
advantage of us;” well naming it, getting advantage. For he no
more takes his own, but violently seizeth ours, for he<note place="end" n="543" id="v.iv-p65.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.iv-p66"> The incestuous person.</p></note> is
reformed<note place="end" n="544" id="v.iv-p66.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.iv-p67"> So two <span class="c18" id="v.iv-p67.1">mss</span>. ap.
Field.</p></note>. And tell
me not that this one only becomes the wild beast’s prey, but
consider this also, that the number of the herd is diminished, and
now especially when it might recover what it had lost. “For we
are not ignorant of his devices,” That he destroys even under the
show of piety. For not only by leading into fornication can he
destroy, but even by the contrary, the unmeasured sorrow following
on the repentance for it. When then besides his own he taketh
ours too, when both by bidding to sin, he destroys; and when we bid
repent, violently seizeth; how is not this case getting
“advantage<note place="end" n="545" id="v.iv-p67.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.iv-p68"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.iv-p68.1">πλεονεξία</span>.</p></note>?” For he
is not content with striking down by sin, but even by repentance he
doth this except we be vigilant. Wherefore also with reason did
he call it getting advantage, when he even conquereth our own
weapons. For to take by sin is his proper work; by repentance,
however, is no more his; for ours, not his, is that weapon. When
then even by this he is able to take, think how disgraceful the
defeat, how he will laugh at and run us down as weak and pitiful,
if he is to subdue us with our own weapons. For it were matter
for exceeding scorn and of the last disgrace, that he should
inflict wounds on us through our own remedies. Therefore he said,
“for we are not 
<pb n="299" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_299.html" id="v.iv-Page_299" />ignorant of his devices,” exposing his
versatility, his craftiness, his evil devices, his malice, his
capacity to injure under a show of piety.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iv-p69">[6.] These things then having in mind, let us too
never despise any one; nor ever, though we fall into sin, despair;
on the other hand, again, let us not be easy-minded afterwards,
but, when we transgress, afflict our minds and not merely give vent
to words. For I know many who say indeed that they bewail their
sins, but do nothing of account. They fast and wear rough
garments; but after money are more eager than hucksters, are more
the prey of anger than wild beasts, and take more pleasure in
detraction than others do in commendations. These things are not
repentance, these things are the semblance and shadow only of
repentance, not repentance itself. Wherefore in the case of these
persons too it is well to say, Take heed “lest Satan should get
an advantage of us, for we are not ignorant of his devices;” for
some he destroys through sins, others through repentance; but these
in yet another way, by suffering them to gain no fruit from
repentance. For when he found not how he might destroy them by
direct [attack,] he came another road, heightening their toils,
whilst robbing them of the fruits, and persuading them, as if they
had successfully accomplished all they had to do, therefore to be
neglectful of what remains.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iv-p70">That we may not then fruitlessly afflict ourselves,
let us address a few words to women of this character; for to women
this disorder especially belongs. Praiseworthy indeed is even
that which now ye do, your fasting and lying on the ground and
ashes; but except the rest be added, these are of no avail. God
hath showed how He remitteth sins. Why then forsaking that path,
do ye carve another for yourselves. In old time the Ninevites
sinned, and they did the things which ye too now are doing. Let
us see however what it was that availed them. For as in the case
of the sick, physicians apply many remedies; howbeit the man of
understanding regardeth not that the sick person has tried this and
that, but what was of service to him; such must be also our inquiry
here. What then was it that availed those barbarians? They
applied fasting unto the wounds, yea applied extreme fasting, lying
on the ground too, putting on of sackcloth, and ashes, and
lamentations; they applied also a change of life. Let us then see
which of these things made them whole. And whence, saith one,
shall we know? If we come to the Physician, if we ask Him: for
He will not hide it from us, but will even eagerly disclose it.
Rather that none may be ignorant, nor need to ask, He hath even set
down in writing the medicine that restored them. What then is
this? “God,” saith He, “saw that they turned every one from
his evil way, and He repented of the evil that He had said He would
do unto them.” (<scripRef passage="Jonah iii. 10" id="v.iv-p70.1" parsed="|Jonah|3|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Jonah.3.10">Jonah
iii. 10</scripRef>.) He said not,
He saw [their] fasting and sackcloth and ashes. And I say not
this to overturn fasting, (God forbid!) but to exhort you that with
fasting ye do that which is better than fasting, the abstaining
from all evil. David also sinned. (<scripRef passage="2 Sam. xii. 17" id="v.iv-p70.2" parsed="|2Sam|12|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Sam.12.17">2 Sam. xii. 17</scripRef>. &amp;c.) Let us see then
how he too repented. Three days he sat on ashes. But this he
did not for the sin’s sake, but for the child’s, being as yet
stupefied with that affliction. But the sin by other means did he
wipe away, by humbleness, contrition of heart, compunction of soul,
by falling into the like no more, by remembering it always, by
bearing thankfully every thing that befalls him, by sparing those
that grieve him, by forbearing to requite those who conspire
against him; yea, even preventing those who desire to do this.
For instance, when Shimei was bespattering him with reproaches
without number (<scripRef passage="2 Sam. xvi. 5, 9" id="v.iv-p70.3" parsed="|2Sam|16|5|0|0;|2Sam|16|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Sam.16.5 Bible:2Sam.16.9">2 Sam.
xvi. 5, 9</scripRef>.) and the
captain who was with him was greatly indignant, he said, “Let him
curse me, for the Lord hath bidden him:” for he had a contrite
and humbled heart, and it was this especially which wiped away his
sins. For this is confession, this is repentance. But if whilst
we fast we are proud, we have been not only nothing profited but
even injured.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iv-p71">[7.] Humble then thine heart, thou too, that thou
mayest draw God unto thee. “For the Lord is nigh unto them that
are of a contrite heart.” (<scripRef passage="Ps. xxxiii. 19" id="v.iv-p71.1" parsed="|Ps|33|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.33.19">Ps. xxxiii. 19</scripRef>.) Seest thou not in the
gorgeous houses those who are in disgrace; how they answer not
again when even the lower servants insult them, but put up with it
because of the disgrace with which their fault hath surrounded
them? So do thou too: and if any one revile thee, wax not
fierce, but groan, not for the insult, but for that sin which cast
thee into disgrace. Groan when thou hast sinned, not because thou
art to be punished, (for this is nothing,) but because thou hast
offended thy Master, one so gentle, one so kind, one that so loveth
thee and longeth for thy salvation as to have given even His Son
for thee. For this groan, and do this continually: for this is
confession. Be not to-day cheerful, to-morrow of a sad
countenance, then again cheerful; but continue ever in mourning and
self contrition. For, “Blessed,” saith he, “are they that
mourn,” that is, that do this perpetually. Continue then to do
this perpetually, and to take heed to thyself, and to afflict thine
heart; as one who had lost a beloved son might mourn. “Rend,”
saith he, “your hearts, and not your garments.” (<scripRef passage="Joel ii. 13" id="v.iv-p71.2" parsed="|Joel|2|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Joel.2.13">Joel ii. 13</scripRef>.) That which is rent will
not lift itself on high; that which hath been broken cannot rise up
again. Hence one saith, “Rend,” and another, “a broken and
a con<pb n="300" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_300.html" id="v.iv-Page_300" />trite heart God will not
despise.” (<scripRef passage="Ps. li. 17" id="v.iv-p71.3" parsed="|Ps|51|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.51.17">Ps. li.
17</scripRef>.) Yea, though thou
be wise, or wealthy, or a ruler, rend thine heart. Suffer it not
to have high thoughts nor to be inflated. For that which is rent
is not inflated, and even if there be something to make it rise,
from being rent it cannot retain the inflation. So also do thou
be humble-minded. Consider that the publican was justified by one
word, although that was not humiliation, but a true confession.
Now if this hath power so great, how much more humiliation. Remit
offences to those who have transgressed against thee, for this too
remitteth sins. And concerning the former He saith, “I saw that
he went sorrowful, and I healed his ways;” (<scripRef passage="Is. lvii. 17, 18" id="v.iv-p71.4" parsed="|Isa|57|17|57|18" osisRef="Bible:Isa.57.17-Isa.57.18">Is. lvii. 17, 18</scripRef>. LXX.) and in Ahab’s case,
this appeased the wrath of God: (<scripRef passage="1 Kings xxi. 29" id="v.iv-p71.5" parsed="|1Kgs|21|29|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Kgs.21.29">1 Kings xxi. 29</scripRef>.) concerning the latter,
“Remit, and it shall be remitted unto you.” There is also
again another way which bringeth us this medicine; condemning what
we have done amiss; for, “Declare thou first thy transgressions,
that thou mayest be justified.” (<scripRef passage="Is. xliii. 26" id="v.iv-p71.6" parsed="|Isa|43|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.43.26">Is. xliii. 26</scripRef>. LXX.) And for one in
afflictions to give thanks looseth his sins; and almsgiving, which
is greater than all.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.iv-p72">Reckon up therefore the medicines which heal
thy wounds, and apply all unremittingly<note place="end" n="546" id="v.iv-p72.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.iv-p73"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.iv-p73.1">συνεχῶς</span>.</p></note>, humbleness, confession, forgetting
wrongs, giving thanks in afflictions, showing mercy both in alms
and actions, persevering in prayer. So did the widow propitiate
the cruel and unyielding judge. And if she the unjust, much more
thou the gentle. There is yet another way along with these,
defending the oppressed; “for,” He saith, “judge the
fatherless, and plead for the widow; and come, and let us reason
together, and though your sins be as scarlet, I will make them
white as snow.” (<scripRef passage="Is. i. 17, 18" id="v.iv-p73.2" parsed="|Isa|1|17|1|18" osisRef="Bible:Isa.1.17-Isa.1.18">Is. i. 17, 18</scripRef>.) What excuse then can we
deserve if with so many ways leading us up to heaven, and so many
medicines to heal our wounds, even after the Laver we continue
where we were. Let us then not only continue so, but let those
indeed who have never yet fallen abide in their proper loveliness;
yea, rather let them cultivate it more and more, (for these good
works, where they find not sins, make the beauty greater:)  and
let us who in many things have done amiss, in order to the
correction of our sins use the means mentioned: that we may stand
at the tribunal of Christ with much boldness, whereunto may all we
attain through the grace and love towards men of our Lord Jesus
Christ, with Whom to the Father, together with the Holy Spirit, be
glory, and power, and honor, now and ever, world without end.
Amen.</p>

<p class="c27" id="v.v-p3">Now when I came to Troas for the gospel of Christ,
and when a door was opened unto me in the Lord, I had no relief for
my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother.</p>

<p class="c24" id="v.v-p4"><span class="c18" id="v.v-p4.1">These</span> words seem on
the one hand to be unworthy of Paul, if because of a brother’s
absence he threw away so great an opportunity of saving; and on the
other, to hang apart from the context. What then? Will ye that
we should first prove that they hang upon the context, or, that he
hath said nothing unworthy of himself? As I think, the second<note place="end" n="547" id="v.v-p4.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.v-p5"> So Chrysostom, referring apparently to the first
sentence in the Homily. It is manifest at least, that the
preceding sentence required “the former” here, and not “the
second.”</p></note>, for so the
other point also will be easier and clearer.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.v-p6">How then do these (words) hang upon those before
them? Let us recall to mind what those were, and so we shall
perceive this. What then were those before? What he said at the
beginning. “I would not have you,” saith he, “ignorant
concerning our affliction which befell us in Asia, that we were
weighed down exceedingly, beyond our power.” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. i. 8" id="v.v-p6.1" parsed="|2Cor|1|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.1.8">2 Cor. i. 8</scripRef>.) Now having shown the
manner of his deliverance, and inserted the intermediate matter, he
is of necessity led to teach them again that in yet another way he
had been afflicted. How, and in what way? In not finding
Titus. (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. 7.6;8.6,16,22,23;12.18" id="v.v-p6.2" parsed="|2Cor|7|6|0|0;|2Cor|8|6|0|0;|2Cor|8|16|0|0;|2Cor|8|22|0|0;|2Cor|8|23|0|0;|2Cor|12|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.7.6 Bible:2Cor.8.6 Bible:2Cor.8.16 Bible:2Cor.8.22 Bible:2Cor.8.23 Bible:2Cor.12.18">vii. 6; viii. 6, 16, 22, 23, xii.
18</scripRef>.) Fearful indeed,
and enough to prostrate the soul, is it even to endure trials; but
when there is none to comfort and that can help to bear the burden,
the tempest becometh greater. Now Titus is he, whom further on he
speaks of as having come to him from them, and of whom he runs
through many and great praises, and whom he said he had sent.
With the view then of showing that in this point also he had been
afflicted for their sakes, he said these things.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.v-p7">That the words then in question hang on what went
before is from all this plain. And I will 
<pb n="301" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_301.html" id="v.v-Page_301" />attempt to prove also that they are not unworthy
of Paul. For He doth not say that the absence of Titus impeded
the salvation of those who were about to come over, nor yet that he
neglected those that believed on this account, but that he had no
relief, that is, ‘I was afflicted, I was distressed for the
absence of my brother;’ showing how great a matter a brother’s
absence is; and therefore he departed thence. But what means,
“when I came to Troas, for the Gospel?” he saith not simply
‘I arrived,’ but ‘so as to preach.’ But still, though I
had both come for that and found very much to do, (for “a door
was opened unto me in the Lord,”) I had, saith he, “no
relief,” not that for this he impeded the work. How then saith
he,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.v-p8"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 2.13" id="v.v-p8.1" parsed="|2Cor|2|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.2.13">Ver. 13</scripRef>. “Taking my leave of them,
I went from thence?”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.v-p9">That is, ‘I spent no longer time, being straitened
and distressed.’ And perhaps the work was even impeded by his
absence. And this was no light consolation to them too. For if
when a door was opened there, and for this purpose he had come; yet
because he found not the brother, he quickly started away; much
more, he saith, ought ye to make allowance for the compulsion of
those affairs which lead us and lead us about everywhere, and
suffer us not according as we desire either to journey, or to tarry
longer amongst those with whom we may wish to remain. Whence also
he proceeds in this place again to refer his journeyings to God, as
he did above to the Spirit, saying,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.v-p10"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 2.14" id="v.v-p10.1" parsed="|2Cor|2|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.2.14">Ver. 14</scripRef>. “But thanks be to God,
which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest
through us the savor of His knowledge in every place.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.v-p11">For that he may not seem as though in sorrow
to be lamenting these things, he sendeth up thanks to God. Now
what he saith is this: ‘Every where is trouble, every where
straitness. I came into Asia, I was burdened beyond strength. I
came to Troas, I found not the brother. I came not to you; this
too bred in me no slight, yea rather, exceeding great dejection,
both because many among you had sinned, and because on this account
I see you not. For, “To spare you,” he saith, “I came not
as yet unto Corinth.” That then he may not seem to be
complaining in so speaking, he adds, ‘We not only do not grieve
in these afflictions, but we even rejoice; and, what is still
greater, not for the sake of the rewards to come only, but those
too even which are present. For even here we are by these things
made glorious and conspicuous. So far then are we from lamenting,
that we even call the thing a triumph<note place="end" n="548" id="v.v-p11.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.v-p12"> [The Rev. Vers. renders this clause
“leadeth us in triumph,” in accordance with Meyer, Beet, <i>et
al</i>. The principal reason is that the causative sense of the
A.V. is against all Hellenistic and New Testament usage, while on
the other hand the <i>neuter</i> sense of the verb to “triumph
over us” easily passes into the <i>transitive</i>, to lead us in
triumph. C.]</p></note>; and glory in what happeneth.’
For which cause also he said, “Now thanks be unto God, Which
always causeth us to triumph,” that is, ‘Who maketh us renowned
unto all. For what seemeth to be matter of disgrace, being
persecuted from every quarter, this appeareth to us to be matter of
very great honor.’ Wherefore he said not, “Which maketh us
seen of all,” but, “Which causeth us to triumph:” showing
that these persecutions set up a series<note place="end" n="549" id="v.v-p12.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.v-p13"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.v-p13.1">συνεχῆ</span>.</p></note> of trophies against the devil in
every part of the world. Then having mentioned along with the
author, the subject also of the triumph, he thereby also raiseth up
the hearer. ‘For not only are we made to triumph by God, but
also “in Christ;”’ that is, on account of Christ and the
Gospel. ‘For seeing it behooveth to triumph, all need is that
we also who carry the trophy are seen of all, because we bear
Him. For this reason we become observed and
conspicuous.’</p>

manifest through us the savor of His knowledge in every
place.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.v-p15">He said above, “Which always causeth us to
triumph.” Here he saith “in every place,” showing that
every place and every time is full of the Apostles’ labors. And
he uses yet another metaphor, that of the sweet savor. For
‘like as those who bear ointment, so are we,’ saith he,
‘manifest to all’; calling the knowledge a very precious
ointment. Moreover, he said not, ‘the knowledge;’ but “the
savor of the knowledge;” for such is the nature of the present
knowledge, not very clear nor uncovered. Whence also he said in
the former Epistle, “For now we see in a mirror darkly.”
(<scripRef passage="1 Cor. xiii. 12" id="v.v-p15.1" parsed="|1Cor|13|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.13.12">1 Cor. xiii. 12</scripRef>.) And here he calls that
which is such a “savor.” Now he that perceiveth the savor
knoweth that there is ointment lying somewhere; but of what nature
it is he knows not yet, unless he happens before to have seen it.
‘So also we. That God is, we know, but what in substance we
know not yet. We are then, as it were, a Royal censer, breathing
whithersoever we go of the heavenly ointment and the spiritual
sweet savor.’ Now he said this, at once both to set forth the
power of the Preaching, in that by the very designs formed against
them, they shine more than those who prosecute them and who cause
the whole world to know both their trophies and their sweet
savor: and to exhort them in regard to their afflictions and
trials to bear all nobly, seeing that even before the Recompense
they reap this glory inexpressible.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.v-p16"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 2.15" id="v.v-p16.1" parsed="|2Cor|2|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.2.15">Ver. 15</scripRef>. “For we are a sweet savor

<p class="c19" id="v.v-p17">Whether, saith he, one be saved or be lost, the
Gospel continues to have its proper virtue: and as the light,
although it blindeth the weakly, is still light, though causing
blindness; and as honey, though it be bitter to those who are
diseased, is in its nature sweet; so also is the Gospel of sweet
savor, even though some should be lost who believe it not. For
not It, but their own perverseness, worketh the perdition. And by
this most of all is its sweet savor manifested, by which the
corrupt and vicious perish; so that not only by the salvation of
the good, but also by the perdition of the wicked is its excellence
declared. Since both the sun, for this reason most especially
that he is exceeding bright, doth wound the eyes of the weak: and
the Saviour is “for the fall and rising again of many,” (<scripRef passage="Luke ii. 34" id="v.v-p17.1" parsed="|Luke|2|34|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.2.34">Luke ii. 34</scripRef>.) but still He
continueth to be a Saviour, though ten thousand fall; and His
coming brought a sorer punishment upon them that believe not, but
still it continueth to be full of healing<note place="end" n="550" id="v.v-p17.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.v-p18"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.v-p18.1">σωτήριος</span>.</p></note>. Whence also he saith, “We are
unto God a sweet savor;” that is, ‘even though some be lost we
continue to be that which we are.’ Moreover he said not simply
“a sweet savor,” but “unto God.” And when we are a sweet
savor unto God, and He decreeth these things, who shall henceforth
gainsay?</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.v-p19">The expression also, “sweet savor of
Christ,” appears to me to admit of a double interpretation: for
he means either that in dying they offered themselves a
sacrifice: or that they were a sweet savor of the death of
Christ, as if one should say, this incense is a sweet savor of this
victim. The expression then, sweet savor, either signifieth this,
or, as I first said, that they are daily sacrificed for Christ’s
sake.<note place="end" n="551" id="v.v-p19.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.v-p20"> [Rather the sense is a sweet-smelling savor of
Christ, something revealing, as perfumes do, the nature of that
from which it proceeds, and so a means of diffusing the knowledge
of Christ. There does not seem to be any reference to sacrifice,
as Chrysostom conceives, nor to the incense of the sanctuary, but
simply to the grateful and pervasive influence of a perfume. It
cannot be hid. It cannot be resisted. Wherever Paul went he
diffused abroad the fragrance of the name of Christ, and thus he
pleased God. The “savor of Christ,” therefore, is not the
savor of which he is the author but that of which he is the
subject. A savor respecting Christ. The Gospel and those who
preach it are well-pleasing to God, as grateful to Him as the
purest and most fragrant incense, whether men receive it and are
saved, or whether they reject it and are lost. Chrysostom well
brings out the solemn and affecting truth that the sweet savor is
manifested in both classes, in them that perish as well as in them
that are saved. C.]</p></note></p>

<p class="c19" id="v.v-p21">[3.] Seest thou to what a height he hath advanced
the trials, terming them a triumph and a sweet savor and a
sacrifice offered unto God. Then, whereas he said, “we are a

death unto death, to the other a savor from life unto life.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.v-p23">For this sweet savor some so receive that they are
saved, others so that they perish. So that should any one be
lost, the fault is from himself: for both ointment is said to
suffocate swine, and light (as I before observed,) to blind the
weak. And such is the nature of good things; they not only
correct what is akin to them, but also destroy the opposite: and
in this way is their power most displayed. For so both fire, not
only when it giveth light and when it purifieth gold, but even when
it consumeth thorns, doth very greatly display its proper power,
and so show itself to be fire: and Christ too herein also doth
discover His own majesty when He “shall consume” Antichrist
“with the breath of His mouth, and bring him to nought with the
manifestation of His coming.” (<scripRef passage="2 Thess. ii. 8" id="v.v-p23.1" parsed="|2Thess|2|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Thess.2.8">2 Thess. ii. 8</scripRef>.)</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.v-p24">“And who is sufficient for these things?”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.v-p25">Seeing he had uttered great things, that ‘we are a
sacrifice of Christ and a sweet savor, and are every where made to
triumph,’ he again useth moderation, referring all to God.
Whence also he saith, “and who is sufficient for these things?”
‘for all,’ saith he, ‘is Christ’s, nothing our own.’
Seest thou how opposite his language to the false Apostles’? 
For they indeed glory, as contributing somewhat from themselves
unto the message: he, on the contrary, saith, he therefore
glorieth, because he saith that nothing is his own. “For our
glorying is this, the testimony of our conscience, that not in
fleshly wisdom, but in the grace of God, we behaved ourselves in
the world.” And that which they considered it a glory to
acquire, I mean the wisdom from without, he makes it his to take
away. Whence also he here saith, “And who is sufficient for
these things?” But if none are sufficient, that which is done
is of grace.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.v-p26"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 2.17" id="v.v-p26.1" parsed="|2Cor|2|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.2.17">Ver. 17</scripRef>. “For we are not as the
rest, which corrupt the word of God.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.v-p27">‘For even if we use great sounding words, yet we
declared nothing to be our own that we achieved, but all
Christ’s. For we will not imitate the false apostles; the men
who say that most is of themselves.’ For this is “to
corrupt,” when one adulterates the wine; when one sells for money
what he ought to give freely. For he seems to me to be here both
taunting them in respect to money, and again hinting at the very
thing I have said, as that they mingle their own things with
God’s; which is the charge Isaiah brings when he said, “Thy
vintners mingle wine with water:” (<scripRef passage="Is. i. 22" id="v.v-p27.1" parsed="|Isa|1|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.1.22">Is. i. 22</scripRef>, LXX.) for even if this was
said of wine, yet one would not err in expounding it of doctrine
too. ‘But we,’ saith he, ‘do not so: but such as we have
been entrusted with, such do we offer you, pouring out the word
undiluted.’ Whence he 
<pb n="303" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_303.html" id="v.v-Page_303" />added, “But as of sincerity, but as of God, in
the sight of God speak we in Christ.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.v-p28">‘We do not,’ saith he ‘beguile you and so
preach, as conferring a gift on you, or as bringing in and mingling
somewhat from ourselves, “but as of God;” that is, we do not
say that we confer any thing of our own, but that God hath given
all.’ For “of God” means this; To glory in nothing as if we
had it of our own, but to refer every thing to Him. “Speak we
in Christ.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.v-p29">Not by our own wisdom, but instructed by the
power that cometh from Him. Those who glory speak not in this
way, but as bringing in something from themselves. Whence he
elsewhere also turns them into ridicule<note place="end" n="552" id="v.v-p29.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.v-p30"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.v-p30.1">κωμῳδεῖ</span>.</p></note>, saying, “For what hast thou that
thou didst not receive? but if thou didst receive it, why dost thou
glory as if thou hadst not received it.” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. iv. 7" id="v.v-p30.2" parsed="|1Cor|4|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.4.7">1 Cor. iv. 7</scripRef>.) This is the highest
virtue, to refer every thing to God, to consider nothing to be our
own, to do nothing out of regard to men’s opinion, but to what
God willeth. For He it is that requireth the account. Now
however this order is reversed: and of Him that shall sit upon
the tribunal and require the account, we have no exceeding fear,
yet tremble at those who stand and are judged with us.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.v-p31">[4.] Whence then is this disease? Whence
hath it broken out in our souls? From not meditating continually
on the things of that world, but being rivetted to present
things. Hence we both easily fall into wicked doings, and even if
we do any good thing we do it for display, so that thence also loss
cometh to us. For instance, one has looked on a person often with
unbridled eyes, unseen of her or of those who walk with her<note place="end" n="553" id="v.v-p31.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.v-p32"> Or, him.</p></note>, yet of the
Eye that never sleeps was not unseen. For even before the
commission of the sin, It saw the unbridled soul, and that madness
within, and the thoughts that were whirled about in storm and
surge; for no need hath He of witnesses and proofs Who knoweth all
things. Look not then to thy fellow-servants: for though man
praise, it availeth not if God accept not; and though man condemn,
it harmeth not if God do not condemn. Oh! provoke not so thy
Judge; of thy fellow-servants making great account, yet when
Himself is angry, not in fear and trembling at Him. Let us then
despise the praise that cometh of men. How long shall we be
low-minded and grovelling? How long, when God lifteth us to
heaven, take we pains to be trailed<note place="end" n="554" id="v.v-p32.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.v-p33"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.v-p33.1">σύρεσθαι</span>.</p></note> along the ground? The brethren of
Joseph, had they had the fear of God before their eyes, as men
ought to have, would not have taken their brother in a lonely place
and killed him. (<scripRef passage="Gen. xxxvii" id="v.v-p33.2" parsed="|Gen|37|0|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.37">Gen. xxxvii</scripRef>.) Cain again, had he feared
that sentence as he should have feared, would not have said,
“Come, and let us go into the field:” (<scripRef passage="Gen. iv. 8" id="v.v-p33.3" parsed="|Gen|4|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.4.8">Gen. iv. 8</scripRef>, LXX.) for to what end,
O miserable and wretched! dost thou take him apart from him that
begat him, and leadest him out into a lonely place? For doth not
God see the daring deed even in the field? Hath thou not been
taught by what befel thy father that He knoweth all things, and is
present at all things that are done? And why, when he denied,
said not God this unto him: ‘Hidest thou from Me Who am present
every where, and know the things that are secret?’ Because as
yet he knew not aright to comprehend these high truths<note place="end" n="555" id="v.v-p33.4"><p class="endnote" id="v.v-p34"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.v-p34.1">ταῦτα φιλοσοφεἷν</span>.</p></note>. But what
saith he? “The voice of thy brother’s blood crieth unto
Me.” Not as though blood had a voice; but like as we say when
things are plain and clear, “the matter speaketh for itself<note place="end" n="556" id="v.v-p34.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.v-p35"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.v-p35.1">βοᾷ</span>.</p></note>.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.v-p36">Wherefore surely it behoveth to have before our eyes
the sentence of God, and all terrors are extinguished. So too in
prayers we can keep awake, if we bear in mind with whom we are
conversing, if we reflect that we are offering sacrifice and have
in our hands a knife and fire and wood; if in thought we throw wide
the gates of heaven, if we transport ourselves thither and taking
the sword of the Spirit infix it in the throat of the victim: 
make watchfulness the sacrifice and tears the libation to Him.
For such is the blood of this victim. Such the slaughter that
crimsons that altar. Suffer not then aught of worldly thoughts to
occupy thy soul then.  Bethink thee that Abraham also, when
offering sacrifice, suffered nor wife nor servant nor any other to
be present. Neither then do thou suffer any of the slavish and
ignoble passions to be present unto thee, but go up alone into the
mountain where he went up, where no second person is permitted to
go up. And should any such thoughts attempt to go up with thee,
command them with authority, and say, “Sit ye there, and I and
the lad will worship and return to you;” (<scripRef passage="Gen. xxii. 5" id="v.v-p36.1" parsed="|Gen|22|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.22.5">Gen. xxii. 5</scripRef>. LXX.) and leaving the ass and
the servants below, and whatever is void of reason and sense, go
up, taking with thee whatever is reasonable, as he took Isaac.
And build thine altar so as he, as having nothing human, but having
outstepped nature. For he too, had he not outstepped nature,
would not have slain his child. And let nothing disturb thee
then, but be lift up above the very heavens. Groan bitterly,
sacrifice confession, (for, saith he, “Declare thou first thy
transgressions that thou mayest be justified,” 
<scripRef passage="Is. xliii. 26" id="v.v-p36.2" parsed="|Isa|43|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.43.26">Is. xliii. 26</scripRef>. LXX.), sacrifice contrition
of heart. These victims turn not to ashes nor 
<pb n="304" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_304.html" id="v.v-Page_304" />dissolve into smoke nor melt into air; neither
need they wood and fire, but only a deep-pricked heart. This is
wood, this is fire to burn, yet not consume them. For he that
prayeth with warmth is burnt, yet not consumed; but like gold that
is tried by fire becometh brighter.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.v-p37">[5.] And withal observe heedfully one thing
more, in praying to say none of those things that provoke thy
Master; neither draw near [to pray] against enemies. For if to
have enemies be a reproach, consider how great the evil to pray
against them. For need is that thou defend thyself and show why
thou hast enemies: but thou even accusest<note place="end" n="557" id="v.v-p37.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.v-p38"> Some <span class="c18" id="v.v-p38.1">mss</span>.

thou obtain, when thou both revilest, and at such a time when
thyself needest much mercy. For thou drewest near to supplicate
for thine own sins: make not mention then of those of others,
lest thou recall the memory of thine own. For if thou say,
‘Smite mine enemy,’ thou hast stopped thy mouth, thou hast cut
off boldness from thy tongue; first, indeed, because thou hast
angered the Judge at once in beginning; next, because thou asketh
things at variance with the character of thy prayer. For if thou
comest near for forgiveness of sins, how discoursest thou of
punishment? The contrary surely was there need to do, and to pray
for them in order that we may with boldness beseech this for
ourselves also. But now thou hast forestalled the Judge’s
sentence by thine own, demanding that He punish them that sin: 
for this depriveth of all pardon. But if thou pray for them, even
if thou say nothing in thine own sins’ behalf, thou hast achieved
all<note place="end" n="558" id="v.v-p38.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.v-p39"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.v-p39.1">τὸ πᾶν ἤνυσας</span>.</p></note>. Consider

numberless others, and not one of them against enemies, but all in
behalf of either one’s own sins or one’s own successes. For
comest thou to another God? To him thou comest that said, “Pray
for your enemies.” (<scripRef passage="Luke vi. 27, 35; Rom. xii. 14" id="v.v-p40.3" parsed="|Luke|6|27|0|0;|Luke|6|35|0|0;|Rom|12|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.6.27 Bible:Luke.6.35 Bible:Rom.12.14">Luke vi. 27, 35; Rom. xii.
14</scripRef>.) How then dost thou
cry against them? How dost thou beseech God to break his own
law? This is not the guise of a suppliant. None supplicates the
destruction of another, but the safety of himself. Why then
wearest thou the guise of a suppliant, but hast the words of an
accuser? Yet when we pray for ourselves, we scratch ourselves and
yawn, and fall into ten thousand thoughts; but when against our
enemies, we do so wakefully. For since the devil knows that we
are thrusting the sword against ourselves, he doth not distract nor
call us off then, that he may work us the greater harm. But,
saith one, ‘I have been wronged and am afflicted.’ Why not
then pray against the devil, who injureth us most of all. This
thou hast also been commanded to say, “Deliver us from the evil
one.” He is thy irreconcileable foe, but man, do whatsoever he
will, is a friend and brother. With him then let us all be angry;
against him let us beseech God, saying, “Bruise Satan under our
feet;” (<scripRef passage="Rom. xvi. 20" id="v.v-p40.4" parsed="|Rom|16|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.16.20">Rom. xvi.
20</scripRef>.) for he it is
that breedeth also the enemies [we have]. But if thou pray
against enemies, thou prayest so as he would have thee pray, just
as if for thine enemies, then against him. Why then letting him
go who is thine enemy indeed, dost thou tear thine own members,
more cruel in this than wild beasts. ‘But,’ saith one, ‘he
insulted me and robbed me of money;’ and which hath need to
grieve, he that suffered injury, or he that inflicted injury? 
Plainly he that inflicted injury, since whilst he gained money he
cast himself out of the favor of God, and lost more than he
gained: so that he is the injured party. Surely then need is
not that one pray against, but for him, that God would be merciful
to him. See how many things the three children suffered, though
they had done no harm. They lost country, liberty, were taken
captive and made slaves; and when carried away into a foreign and
barbarous land, were even on the point of being slain on account of
the dream, without cause or object<note place="end" n="560" id="v.v-p40.5"><p class="endnote" id="v.v-p41"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.v-p41.1">εἰκῆ καὶ μάτην</span>.</p></note>.

entered in with Daniel, what prayed they? What said they? Dash
down Nabuchodonosor, pull down his diadem, hurl him from the
throne? Nothing of this sort; but they desired “mercies of
God.” (<scripRef passage="Dan. ii. 18" id="v.v-p41.3" parsed="|Dan|2|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Dan.2.18">Dan. ii.
18</scripRef>. LXX.) And when they
were in the furnace, likewise. But not so ye: but when ye
suffer far less than they, and oftentimes justly, ye cease not to
vent ten thousand imprecations. And one saith, ‘Strike down my
enemy as Thou overwhelmedst the chariot of Pharaoh;’ another,
‘Blast his flesh;’ another again, ‘Requite it on his
children.’ Recognize ye not these words? Whence then is this
your laughter? Seest thou how laughable this is, when it is
uttered without passion. And so all sin then discovereth how vile
it is, when thou strippest it of the state of mind of the
perpetrator. Shouldest thou remind one who has been angered of
the words which he said in his passion, he will sink for shame and
scorn himself and wish he had suffered a thousand punishments
rather than those words to be his. And shouldest thou, when the
embrace is over, bring the unchaste to the woman he sinned with, he
too will turn away from her as disgusting. And so do ye, because
ye are not under the influence of the passion, laugh now. <pb n="305" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_305.html" id="v.v-Page_305" />For worthy to be laughed at are they,
and the words of drunken old gossips; and springing from a womanish
littleness of soul. And yet Joseph, though he had been sold and
made a slave, and had tenanted a prison, uttered not even then a
bitter word against the authors of his sorrows. But what saith
he? “Indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the
Hebrews;” (<scripRef passage="Gen. xl. 15" id="v.v-p41.4" parsed="|Gen|40|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.40.15">Gen. xl.
15</scripRef>.) and addeth not
by whom. For he feels more ashamed for the wickedness of his
brethren, than they who wrought them. Such too ought to be our
disposition, to grieve for them who wrong us more than they
themselves do. For the hurt passeth on to them. As then they
who kick against nails, yet are proud of it, are fit objects of
pity and lamentation on account of this madness; so they who wrong
those that do them no evil, inasmuch as they wound their own souls,
are fit objects for many moans and lamentations, not for curses.
For nothing is more polluted than a soul that curseth, or more
impure than a tongue that offereth such sacrifices. Thou art a
man; vomit not forth the poison of asps. Thou art a man; become
not a wild beast. For this was thy mouth made, not that thou
shouldest bite but that thou shouldest heal the wounds of others.
‘Remember the charge I have given thee,’ saith God, ‘to
pardon and forgive. But thou beseechest Me also to be a party to
the overthrow of my own commandments, and devourest thy brother,
and reddenest thy tongue, as madmen do their teeth on their own
members.’ How, thinkest thou, the devil is pleased and laughs,
when he hears such a prayer? and how, God is provoked, and turneth
from and abhorreth thee, when thou beseechest things like these? 
Than which, what can be more dangerous? For if none should
approach the mysteries that hath enemies: how must not he, that
not only hath, but also prayeth against them, be excluded even from
the outer courts themselves? Thinking then on these things, and

himself an objection which others would have urged against him,
‘Thou vauntest thyself;’ and this though he had before employed
so strong a corrective in the expressions, “Who is sufficient for

satisfied with these. For such is his character. From appearing
to say any thing great of himself he is far removed, and avoids it
even to great superfluity and excess. And mark, I pray thee, by
this instance also, the abundance of his wisdom. For a thing of
woeful aspect, I mean tribulations, he so much exalted and showed
to be bright and lustrous, that out of what he said the present
objection rose up against him. And he does so also towards the
end. For after having enumerated numberless perils, insults,
straits, necessities, and as many such like things as be, he added,
“We commend not ourselves, but speak as giving you occasion to

this again with vehemence in that place, and with more of
encouragement. For here the words are those of love, “Need we,
as do some, epistles of commendation?” but there what he says is
full of a kind of pride even, necessarily and properly so, of
pride, I say, and anger. “For we commend not ourselves
again,” saith he, “but speak as giving you occasion to
glory;” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. v. 12" id="v.vi-p4.4" parsed="|2Cor|5|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.5.12">2 Cor. v.

appearance of a wish to flatter, as though he desired honor from
them, he speaketh thus, “I fear lest by any means when I come I
should not find you such as I would, and should myself be found of
you such as ye would not.” This however comes after many
accusations<note place="end" n="564" id="v.vi-p5.4"><p class="endnote" id="v.vi-p6"> Others read, “with much accusation.”</p></note>; But in the
beginning he speaketh not so, but 
<pb n="306" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_306.html" id="v.vi-Page_306" />more gently. And what is it he saith? 
He spoke of his trials and his perils, and that every where he is
conducted as in procession<note place="end" n="565" id="v.vi-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.vi-p7"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.vi-p7.1">πομπεύεται</span>.</p></note> by God in Christ, and that the
whole world knoweth of these triumphs. Since then he has uttered
great things of himself, he urges this objection against himself,
“Are we beginning again to commend ourselves?” Now what he
saith is this: Perchance some one will object, ‘What is this, O
Paul? Sayest thou these things of thyself, and exaltest
thyself?’ To do away then with this suspicion, he saith, We
desire not this, that is, to boast and exalt ourselves; yea, so far
are we from needing epistles of commendation to you that ye are to
us instead of an epistle. “For,” saith he,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.vi-p9">What means this, “ye are?” ‘Did we need to

it in this manner, but in irony so as to make his question, “Do
we need epistles of commendation?” more cutting. And in
allusion to the false apostles, he added, “as do some, [epistles
of commendation] to you, or letters of commendation from you” to
others. Then because what he had said was severe, he softens it
by adding, “Ye are our epistle, written in our hearts, known of
all,</p>

“Being made manifest that ye are an epistle of Christ.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.vi-p11">Here he testifieth not only to their love, but also
to their good works: since they are able to show unto all men by
their own virtue the high worth of their teacher, for this is the
meaning of, “Ye are our epistle.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.vi-p12">What letters would have done to commend and gain
respect for us, that ye do both as seen and heard of; for the
virtue of the disciples is wont to adorn and to commend the teacher
more than any letter.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.vi-p13"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 3.3" id="v.vi-p13.1" parsed="|2Cor|3|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.3.3">Ver. 3</scripRef>.
“Written in our hearts.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.vi-p14">That is, which all know; we so bear you about every
where and have you in mind. As though he said, Ye are our
commendation to others, for we both have you continually in our
heart and proclaim to all your good works. Because then that even
to others yourselves are our commendation, we need no epistles from
you; but further, because we love you exceedingly, we need no
commendation to you. For to those who are strangers one hath need
of letters, but ye are in our mind. Yet he said not merely, “ye
are [in it],” but “written in [it],” that is, ye cannot slide
out of it. For just as from letters by reading, so from our heart
by perceiving, all are acquainted with the love we bear you. If
then the object of a letter be to certify, “such an one is my
friend and let him have free intercourse [with you],” your love
is sufficient to secure all this. For should we go to you, we
have no need of others to commend us, seeing your love anticipateth
this; and should we go to others, again we need no letters, the
same love again sufficing unto us in their stead, for we carry
about the epistle in our hearts.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.vi-p15">[2.] Then exalting them still higher, he even
calleth them the epistle of Christ, saying,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.vi-p16"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 3.3" id="v.vi-p16.1" parsed="|2Cor|3|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.3.3">Ver. 3</scripRef>.
“Being made manifest that ye are an epistle of Christ.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.vi-p17">And having said this, he afterwards hence
takes ground and occasion for a discussion on the Law. And there
is another<note place="end" n="566" id="v.vi-p17.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.vi-p18"> Or, perhaps, a special aim, <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.vi-p18.1"> ἂλλως</span>.</p></note> aim in his
here styling them His epistle. For above as commending him, he
called them an epistle; but here an epistle of Christ, as having
the Law of God written in them. For what things God wished to
declare to all and to you, these are written in your hearts. But
it was we who prepared you to receive the writing. For just as
Moses hewed the stones and tables, so we, your souls. Whence he
saith,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.vi-p19">“Ministered by us.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.vi-p20">Yet in this they were on an equality; for the former
were written on by God, and these by the Spirit. Where then is
the difference?</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.vi-p21">“Written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the
living God; not in tables of stone, but in tables that are hearts
of flesh.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.vi-p22">Wide as the difference between the Spirit and
ink, and a stony table and a fleshy, so wide is that between these
and those; consequently between themselves<note place="end" n="567" id="v.vi-p22.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.vi-p23"> i.e. the Apostles.</p></note> who ministered, and him<note place="end" n="568" id="v.vi-p23.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.vi-p24"> Moses.</p></note> who
ministered to them. Yet because it was a great thing he had
uttered, he therefore quickly checks himself, saying,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.vi-p25"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 3.4" id="v.vi-p25.1" parsed="|2Cor|3|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.3.4">Ver. 4</scripRef>.
“And such confidence have we through Christ to Godward,”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.vi-p26">And again refers all to God: for it is Christ,
saith he, Who is the Author of these things to us.</p>

“Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to account any thing as
from ourselves.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.vi-p28">See again, yet another corrective. For he
possesses this virtue, humility I mean, in singular perfection.
Wherefore whenever he saith any thing great of himself, he maketh
all diligence to soften down extremely and by every means, what he
has said. And so he does in this place also, saying, “Not that
we are sufficient of ourselves to account any thing as from
ourselves:” that is, I said not, “We have confidence,” as
<pb n="307" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_307.html" id="v.vi-Page_307" />though part were ours and part
God’s; but I refer and ascribe the whole to Him.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.vi-p29"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 3.5,6" id="v.vi-p29.1" parsed="|2Cor|3|5|3|6" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.3.5-2Cor.3.6">Ver. 5, 6</scripRef>. “For<note place="end" n="569" id="v.vi-p29.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.vi-p30"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.vi-p30.1">γὰρ</span>, Rec. text, <span class="Greek" id="v.vi-p30.2">ἁλλά</span>, [which is
retained by all critics. C.]</p></note> our
sufficiency is from God; who also made us sufficient as ministers
of a new covenant.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.vi-p31">What means, “made us sufficient?” Made us able
and fitting. And it is not a little thing to be the bearer to the
world of such tables and letters, greater far than the former.
Whence also he added,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.vi-p32">“Not of the letter, but of the spirit.” See
again another difference. What then? was not that Law
spiritual? How then saith he, “We know that the Law is
spiritual?” (<scripRef passage="Rom. vii. 14" id="v.vi-p32.1" parsed="|Rom|7|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.7.14">Rom. vii.
14</scripRef>.) Spiritual indeed,
but it bestowed not a spirit. For Moses bare not a spirit, but
letters; but we have been entrusted with the giving of a spirit.
Whence also in further completion of this [contrast,] he saith,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.vi-p33">“For the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth
life.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.vi-p34">Yet these things he saith not absolutely<note place="end" n="570" id="v.vi-p34.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.vi-p35"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.vi-p35.1">ἁ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.vi-p35.2">πλὧς</span>.</p></note>; but in
allusion to those who prided themselves upon the things of
Judaism. And by “letter” here he meaneth the Law which
punisheth them that transgress; but by “spirit” the grace which
through Baptism giveth life to them who by sins were made dead.
For having mentioned the difference arising from the nature of the
tables, he doth not dwell upon it, but rapidly passing it by,
bestows more labor upon this, which most enabled him to lay hold on
his hearer from considerations of what was advantageous and easy;
for, saith he, it is not laborious, and the gift it offers is
greater. For if when discoursing of Christ, he puts especially
forward those things which are of His lovingkindness, more than of
our merit, and which are mutually connected, much greater necessity
is there for his doing so when treating of the covenant. What
then is the meaning of “the letter killeth?” He had said
tables of stone and hearts of flesh: so far he seemed to mention
no great difference. He added that the former [covenant] was
written with letters or ink, but this with the Spirit. Neither
did this rouse them thoroughly, He says at last what is indeed
enough to give them wings<note place="end" n="571" id="v.vi-p35.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.vi-p36"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.vi-p36.1">πτερῶσαι</span>.</p></note>; the one “killeth,” the other
“giveth life.” And what doth this mean? In the Law, he that
hath sin is punished; here, he that hath sins cometh and is
baptized and is made righteous, and being made righteous, he
liveth, being delivered from the death of sin. The Law, if it lay
hold on a murderer, putteth him to death; the Gospel, if it lay
hold on a murderer, enlighteneth, and giveth him life. And why do
I instance a murderer? The Law laid hold on one that gathered
sticks on a sabbath day, and stoned him. (<scripRef passage="Numb. xv. 32, 36" id="v.vi-p36.2" parsed="|Num|15|32|0|0;|Num|15|36|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Num.15.32 Bible:Num.15.36">Numb. xv. 32, 36</scripRef>.) This is the meaning of,
“the letter killeth.” The Gospel takes hold on thousands of
homicides and robbers, and baptizing delivereth them from their
former vices. This is the meaning of, “the Spirit giveth
life.” The former maketh its captive dead from being alive, the
latter rendereth the man it hath convicted alive from being dead.
For, “come unto me, ye that labor and are heavy laden,” (<scripRef passage="Matt. xi. 28" id="v.vi-p36.3" parsed="|Matt|11|28|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.11.28">Matt. xi. 28</scripRef>.) and, He said not, ‘I will
punish you,’ but, “I will give you rest.” For in Baptism
the sins are buried, the former things are blotted out, the man is
made alive, the entire grace written upon his heart as it were a
table. Consider then how high is the dignity of the Spirit,
seeing that His tables are better than those former ones; seeing
that even a greater thing is shown forth than the resurrection
itself. For indeed, that state of death from which He delivers,
is more irremediable than the former one: as much more so, as
soul is of more value than the body: and this life is conferred
by that, by that which the Spirit giveth. But if It be able to
bestow this, much more then that which is less. For, that
prophets wrought, but this they could not: for none can remit
sins but God only; nor did the prophets bestow that life without
the Spirit. But this is not the marvel only, that it giveth life,
but that it enabled others also to do this. For He saith,
“Receive ye the Holy Ghost.” (<scripRef passage="John xx. 22" id="v.vi-p36.4" parsed="|John|20|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.20.22">John xx. 22</scripRef>.) Wherefore? Because
without the Spirit it might not be? [Yes,] but God, as showing
that It is of supreme authority, and of that Kingly Essence, and
hath the same power [with Himself,] saith this too. Whence also
He adds, “Whosesoever sins ye remit, they are remitted; and
whosesoever sins ye retain, they are retained.” (<scripRef passage="John 20.23" id="v.vi-p36.5" parsed="|John|20|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.20.23">ibid.
23</scripRef>.)</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.vi-p37">[3.] Since then It hath given us life, let us
remain living and not return again to the former deadness: for
“Christ dieth no more; for the death that He died, He died unto
sin once:” (<scripRef passage="Rom. vi. 9, 10" id="v.vi-p37.1" parsed="|Rom|6|9|6|10" osisRef="Bible:Rom.6.9-Rom.6.10">Rom. vi.
9, 10</scripRef>.) and He will not
have us always saved by grace: for so we shall be empty of all
things. Wherefore He will have us contribute something also from
ourselves. Let us then contribute, and preserve to the soul its
life. And what is life in a soul, learn from the body. For the
body too we then affirm to live, when it moves with a healthy kind
of motion; but when it lies prostrate and powerless, or its motions
are disorderly, though it retain the semblance of life or motion,
such a life is more grievous than any death: and should it utter
nothing sane but words of the crazy, and see one object instead of
another, such a man again is more pitiable than those who are
dead. So also the soul when 
<pb n="308" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_308.html" id="v.vi-Page_308" />it hath no healthiness, though it retain a
semblance of life, is dead: when it doth not see gold as gold but
as something great and precious; when it thinketh not of the future
but crawleth upon the ground; when it doth one thing in place of
another. For whence is it clear that we have a soul? Is it not
from its operations? When then it doth not perform the things
proper to it, is it not dead? when, for instance, it hath no care
for virtue, but is rapacious and transgresseth the law; whence can
I tell that thou hast a soul? Because thou walkest? But this
belongs to the irrational creatures as well. Because thou eatest
and drinkest? But this too belongeth to wild beasts. Well then,
because thou standest upright on two feet? This convinceth me
rather that thou art a beast in human form. For when thou
resemblest one in all other respects, but not in its manner of
erecting itself, thou dost the more disturb and terrify me; and I
the more consider that which I see to be a monster. For did I see
a beast speaking with the voice of a man, I should not for that
reason say it was a man, but even for that very reason a beast more
monstrous than a beast. Whence then can I learn that thou hast
the soul of a man, when thou kickest like the ass, when thou
bearest malice like the camel, when thou bitest like the bear, when
thou ravenest like the wolf, when thou stealest like the fox, when
thou art wily as the serpent, when thou art shameless as the dog? 
Whence can I learn that thou hast the soul of a man? Will ye that
I show you a dead soul and a living? Let us turn the discourse
back to those men of old; and, if you will, let us set before us
the rich man [in the story] of Lazarus, and we shall know what is
death in a soul; for he had a dead soul, and it is plain from what
he did. For, of the works of the soul he did not one, but ate and
drank and lived in pleasure only. Such are even now the
unmerciful and cruel, for these too have a dead soul as he had.
For all its warmth that floweth out of the love of our neighbor
hath been spent, and it is deader than a lifeless body. But the
poor man was not such, but standing on the very summit of heavenly
wisdom shone out; and though wrestling with continual hunger, and
not even supplied with the food that was necessary, neither so
spake he aught of blasphemy against God, but endured all nobly.
Now this is no trifling work of the soul; but a very high proof
that it is well-strung and healthful. And when there are not
these qualities, it is plainly because the soul is dead that they
have perished. Or, tell me, shall we not pronounce that soul dead
which the Devil falls upon, striking, biting, spurning it, yet hath
it no sense of any of these things, but lieth deadened nor grieveth
when being robbed of its wealth; but he even leapeth upon it, yet
it remaineth unmoved, like a body when the soul is departed, nor
even feeleth it? For when the fear of God is not present with
strictness, such must the soul needs be, and then the dead more
miserable. For the soul is not dissolved into corruption and
ashes and dust, but into things of fouler odor than these, into
drunkenness and anger and covetousness, into improper loves and
unseasonable desires. But if thou wouldest know more exactly how
foul an odor it hath, give me a soul that is pure, and then thou
wilt see clearly how foul the odor of this filthy and impure one.
For at present thou wilt not be able to perceive it. For so long
as we are in contact habitually with a foul odor, we are not
sensible of it. But when we are fed with spiritual words, then
shall we be cognizant of that evil. And yet to many this seemeth
of no importance<note place="end" n="572" id="v.vi-p37.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.vi-p38"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.vi-p38.1">ἀ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.vi-p38.2">διάφορον</span>.</p></note>. And I say
nothing as yet of hell; but let us, if you will, examine what is
present, and how worthy of derision is he, not that practiseth, but
that uttereth filthiness; how first he loadeth himself with
contumely; just as one that sputtereth any filth from the mouth, so
he defiles himself. For if the stream is so impure, think what
must be the fountain of this filth! “for out of the abundance of
the heart the mouth speaketh.” (<scripRef passage="Matt. xii. 34" id="v.vi-p38.3" parsed="|Matt|12|34|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.12.34">Matt. xii. 34</scripRef>.) Yet not for this
alone do I grieve, but because that to some this doth not even seem
to be reckoned amongst improper things. Hence the evils are all
made worse, when we both sin, and do not think we even do amiss.<note place="end" n="573" id="v.vi-p38.4"><p class="endnote" id="v.vi-p39"> [Chrysostom’s view of this verse is correct
as far as it goes. But a fuller statement is that the <i>
letter</i> kills by demanding perfect obedience which none can
render, by producing the knowledge of sin and guilt, and by
exasperating the soul in holding forth to it a high standard of
duty which it neither can nor wishes to obey. The <i>spirit</i>,
on the other hand, gives life by revealing a perfect and gratuitous
righteousness, by exhibiting God’s love and awakening hope
instead of fear, and by transforming the soul through the Holy
Ghost so that it bears the image of God. The letter is equivalent
to the Law; the spirit to the Gospel. The contrast is not between
the Old covenant and the New, considered as successive
dispensations of the one system of grace, but between the Mosaic
economy as conditioning acceptance upon works (“Do this and
live”), and the Christian as offering salvation to every one that
believeth. C.]</p></note></p>

<p class="c19" id="v.vi-p40">[4.] Wilt thou then learn how great an evil is
filthy talking? See how the hearers blush at thy indecency. For
what is viler than a filthy talker? what more infamous? For such
thrust themselves into the rank of buffoons and of prostituted
women, yea rather these have more shame than you. How canst thou
teach a wife to be modest when by such language thou art training
her to proceed unto lasciviousness? Better vent rottenness from
the mouth than a filthy word. Now if thy mouth have an ill-odor,
thou partakest not even of the common meats; when then thou hadst
so foul a stink in thy soul, tell me, dost thou dare to partake of
<pb n="309" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_309.html" id="v.vi-Page_309" />mysteries? Did any one
take a dirty vessel and set it upon the table, thou wouldest have
beaten him with clubs and driven him out: yet God at His own
table, (for His table our mouth is when filled with thanksgiving,)
when thou pourest out words more disgusting than any unclean
vessel, tell me, dost thou think that thou provokest not? And how
is this possible? For nothing doth so exasperate the holy and
pure as do such words; nothing makes men so impudent<note place="end" n="574" id="v.vi-p40.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.vi-p41"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.vi-p41.1">ἰ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.vi-p41.2">ταμοὺς</span>.</p></note> and
shameless as to say and listen to such; nothing doth so unstring
the sinews of modesty as the flame which these kindle. God hath
set perfumes in thy mouth, but thou storest up words of fouler odor
than a corpse, and destroyest the soul itself and makest it
incapable of motion. For when thou insultest, this is not the
voice of the soul, but of anger; when thou talkest filthily, it is
lewdness, and not she that spake; when thou detractest, it is envy;
when thou schemest, covetousness. These are not her works, but
those of the affections<note place="end" n="575" id="v.vi-p41.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.vi-p42"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.vi-p42.1">παθῶν</span>.</p></note> and the diseases belonging to
her. As then corruption cometh not simply of the body, but of the
death and the passion which is thus in the body; so also, in truth,
these things come of the passions which grow upon the soul. For
if thou wilt hear a voice from a living soul, hear Paul saying,
“Having food and covering, we shall be therewith content:”

<p class="c19" id="v.vii-p6">For if that ministration were of death, but this of
life, doubtless, saith he, the latter glory is also greater than
the former. For since he could not exhibit it to the bodily eyes,
by this logical inference he established its superiority,
saying,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.vii-p7"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 3.8" id="v.vii-p7.1" parsed="|2Cor|3|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.3.8">Ver. 8</scripRef>.
“But if the ministration of death came with glory, how shall not
rather the ministration of the Spirit be with glory?”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.vii-p8">Now by “ministration of death” he means <pb n="310" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_310.html" id="v.vii-Page_310" />the Law. And mark too how
great the caution he uses in the comparison so as to give no handle
to the heretics; for he said not, ‘which causeth death,’ but,
“the ministration of death;” for it ministereth unto, but was
not the parent of, death; for that which caused death was sin; but
[the Law] brought in the punishment, and showed the sin, not caused
it. For it more distinctly revealed the evil and punished it: 
it did not impel unto the evil: and it ministered not to the
existence of sin or death, but to the suffering of retribution by
the sinner. So that in this way it was even destructive of sin.
For that which showeth it to be so fearful, it is obvious, maketh
it also to be avoided. As then he that taketh the sword in his
hands and cutteth off the condemned, ministers to the judge that
passeth sentence, and it is not he that is his destruction,
although he cutteth him off; nay, nor yet is it he who passeth
sentence and condemneth, but the wickedness of him that is
punished; so truly here also it is not that<note place="end" n="578" id="v.vii-p8.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.vii-p9"> i.e., the Law.</p></note> destroyeth, but sin. This did
both destroy and condemn, but that by punishing undermined its
strength, by the fear of the punishment holding it back. But he
was not content with this consideration only in order to establish
the superiority [in question]; but he addeth yet another, saying,
“written, and engraven on stones.” See how he again cuts at
the root of the Jewish arrogancy. For the Law was nothing else
but letters: a certain succor was not found leaping forth from
out the letters and inspiring them that combat, as is the case in
Baptism; but pillars and writings bearing death to those who
transgress the letters. Seest thou how in correcting the Jewish
contentiousness, by his very expressions even he lessens its
authority, speaking of stone and letters and a ministration of
death, and adding that it was engraven? For hereby he declareth
nothing else than this, that the Law was fixed in one place; not,
as the Spirit, was present everywhere, breathing great might into
all; or that the letters breathe much threatening, and threatening
too which can not be effaced but remaineth for ever, as being
engraved in stone. Then even whilst seeming to praise the old
things, he again mixeth up accusation of the Jews. For having
said, “written and engraven in stones, came with glory,” he
added, “so that the children of Israel could not look steadfastly
upon the face of Moses;” which was a mark of their great weakness
and grovelling spirit. And again he doth not say, ‘for the
glory of the tables,’ but, “for the glory of his countenance,
which glory was passing away;” for he showeth that he who beareth
them is made glorious, and not they. For he said not, ‘because
they could not look steadfastly upon the tables,’ but, “the
face of Moses;” and again, not, ‘for the glory of the
tables,’ but, “for the glory of his face.” Then after he
had extolled it, see how again he lowers it, saying, “which was
passing away.” Not however that this is in accusation, but in
diminution; for he did not say, ‘which was corrupt, which was
evil,’ but, ‘which ceaseth and hath an end.’</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.vii-p10">“How shall not rather the ministration of the
Spirit be with glory?” for henceforth with confidence he
extolleth the things of the New [Covenant] as indisputable. And
observe what he doth. He opposed ‘stone’ to ‘heart,’ and
‘letter’ to ‘spirit.’ Then having shown the results of
each, he doth not set down the results of each; but having set down
the work of the latter, namely, death and condemnation, he setteth
not down that of the spirit, namely, life and righteousness; but
the Spirit Itself; which added greatness to the argument. For the
New Covenant not only gave life, but supplied also ‘The Spirit’
Which giveth the life, a far greater thing than the life.
Wherefore he said, “the ministration of the Spirit.” Then he
again reverts to the same thing, saying,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.vii-p11"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 3.9" id="v.vii-p11.1" parsed="|2Cor|3|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.3.9">Ver. 9</scripRef>.
“For if the ministration of condemnation is glory.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.vii-p12">Also, he interprets more clearly the meaning of the
words, “The letter killeth,” declaring it to be that which we
have said above, namely, that the Law showed sin, not caused
it.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.vii-p13">“Much rather doth the ministration of
righteousness exceed in glory.” For those Tables indeed showed
the sinners and punished them, but this not only did not punish the
sinners, but even made them righteous: for this did Baptism
confer.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.vii-p14">[2.] <scripRef passage="2 Cor. 3.10" id="v.vii-p14.1" parsed="|2Cor|3|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.3.10">Ver. 10</scripRef>. “For verily that which
hath been made glorious hath not been made glorious in this
respect, by reason of the glory that surpasseth.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.vii-p15">Now in what has gone before, indeed, he showed that
this also is with glory; and not simply is with glory, but even
exceedeth in it: for he did not say, “How shall not the
ministration of the Spirit be rather in glory?” but, “exceed in
glory;” deriving the proof from the arguments before stated.
Here he also shows the superiority, how great it is, saying, ‘if
I compare this with that, the glory of the Old Covenant is not
glory at all;’ not absolutely laying down that there was no
glory, but in view of the comparison. Wherefore also he added,
“in this respect,” that is, in respect of the comparison. Not
that this doth disparage the Old Covenant, yea rather it highly
commendeth it: for comparisons are wont to be made between things
which are the same in kind. Next, he sets on foot yet another
argument to prove the superiority also from a fresh ground. <pb n="311" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_311.html" id="v.vii-Page_311" />What then is this argument? That
based upon duration, saying,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.vii-p16"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 3.11" id="v.vii-p16.1" parsed="|2Cor|3|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.3.11">Ver. 11</scripRef>. “For if that which
passeth away was with glory, much more that which remaineth is in
glory.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.vii-p17">For the one ceased, but the other abideth
continually.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.vii-p18"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 3.12" id="v.vii-p18.1" parsed="|2Cor|3|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.3.12">Ver. 12</scripRef>. “Having therefore such a
hope, we use great boldness of speech.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.vii-p19">For since when he had heard so many and so great
things concerning the New [Covenant,] the hearer would be desirous
of seeing this glory manifested to the eye, mark whither he hurleth
him, [even] to the world to come. Wherefore also he brought
forward the “hope,” saying, “Having therefore such a
hope.” Such? Of what nature? That we have been counted
worthy of greater things than Moses; not we the Apostles only, but
also all the faithful. “We use great boldness of speech.”
Towards whom? tell me. Towards God, or towards the disciples? 
Towards you who are receiving instruction, he saith; that is, we
speak every where with freedom, hiding nothing, withholding
nothing, mistrusting nothing, but speaking openly; and we have not
feared lest we should wound your eyesight, as Moses did that of the
Jews. For that he alluded to this, hear what follows; or rather,
it is necessary first to relate the history, for he himself keeps
dwelling upon it. What then is the history? When, having
received the Tables a second time, Moses came down, a certain glory
darting from his countenance shone so much that the Jews were not
able to approach and talk with him until he put a veil over his
face. And thus it is written in Exodus, (<scripRef passage="Exod. xxxiv. 29, 34" id="v.vii-p19.1" parsed="|Exod|34|29|0|0;|Exod|34|34|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Exod.34.29 Bible:Exod.34.34">Exod. xxxiv. 29, 34</scripRef>.) “When Moses came
down from the Mount, the two Tables [were] in his hands.  And
Moses wist not that the skin of his countenance was made glorious
to behold. And they were afraid to come nigh him. And Moses
called them, and spake unto them. And when<note place="end" n="579" id="v.vii-p19.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.vii-p20"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.vii-p20.1">επειδὴ</span>, so also LXX. E.V.
“till.”</p></note> Moses had done speaking with them,
he put a veil over his face. But when he went in before the Lord
to speak [with Him], he took the veil off until he came
out.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.vii-p21">Putting them in mind then of this history, he
says,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.vii-p22"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 3.13" id="v.vii-p22.1" parsed="|2Cor|3|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.3.13">Ver. 13</scripRef>. “And not as Moses, who
put a veil upon his face, so that the children of Israel should not
look steadfastly on the end of that which was passing away.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.vii-p23">Now what he says is of this nature. There is no
need for us to cover ourselves as Moses did; for ye are able to
look upon this glory which we are encircled with, although it is
far greater and brighter than the other. Seest thou the
advance? For he that in the former Epistle said, “I have fed
you with milk, not with meat;” saith here, “We use great
boldness of speech.” And he produces Moses before them,
carrying forward the discourse by means of comparison, and thus
leading his hearer upwards.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.vii-p24">And for the present he sets them above the
Jews, saying that ‘we have no need of a veil as he<note place="end" n="580" id="v.vii-p24.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.vii-p25"> i.e., Moses.</p></note> had with
those he governed;’ but in what comes afterwards he advances them
even to the dignity itself of the Lawgiver, or even to a much
greater.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.vii-p26">Mean time, however, let us hear what follows
next.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.vii-p27"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 3.14" id="v.vii-p27.1" parsed="|2Cor|3|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.3.14">Ver. 14</scripRef>. “But their minds
were hardened, for until this day remaineth the same veil in the
reading of the Old Covenant, [it] not being revealed to them<note place="end" n="581" id="v.vii-p27.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.vii-p28"> So he reads the text.</p></note> that it is
done away in Christ.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.vii-p29">See what he establisheth by this. For what
happened then once in the case of Moses, the same happeneth
continually in the case of the Law. What is said, therefore, is
no accusation of the Law, as neither is it of Moses that he then
veiled himself, but only the senseless Jews. For the law hath its
proper glory, but they were unable to see it. ‘Why therefore
are ye perplexed,’ he saith, ‘if they are unable to see this
glory of the Grace, since they saw not that lesser one of Moses,
nor were able to look steadfastly upon his countenance? And why
are ye troubled that the Jews believe not Christ, seeing at least
that they believe not even the Law? For they were therefore
ignorant of the Grace also, because they knew not even the Old
Covenant nor the glory which was in it. For the glory of the Law
is to turn [men] unto Christ.’</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.vii-p30">[3.] Seest thou how from this consideration also
he takes down the inflation of the Jews? By that in which they
thought they had the advantage, namely, that Moses’ face shone,
he proves their grossness and groveling nature. Let them not
therefore pride themselves on that, for what was that to Jews who
enjoyed it not? Wherefore also he keeps on dwelling upon it,
saying one while, “The same veil in the reading of the old
covenant remaineth,” it “not being revealed that it is done
away in Christ:” another while, that “unto this day when
Moses is read,” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. 3.15" id="v.vii-p30.1" parsed="|2Cor|3|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.3.15">v. 15</scripRef>.)
the same “veil lieth upon their heart; “showing that the veil
lieth both on the reading and on their heart; and above, “So that
the children of Israel could not look steadfastly upon the face of
Moses for the glory of his countenance; which” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. 3.7" id="v.vii-p30.2" parsed="|2Cor|3|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.3.7">v. 7.</scripRef>)
glory “was passing away.” Than which what could mark less
worth in them? Seeing that even of a glory that is to be done
away, or rather is in comparison no glory at all, they are not able
to be spectators, but it is covered from 
<pb n="312" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_312.html" id="v.vii-Page_312" />them, “so that they could not steadfastly
look on the end of that which was passing away;” that is, of the
law, because it hath an end; “but their minds were hardened.”
‘And what,’ saith one, ‘hath this to do with the veil
then?’ Because it prefigured what would be. For not only did
they not then perceive; but they do not even now see the Law. And
the fault lies with themselves, for the hardness is that of an
unimpressible and perverse judgment. So that it is we who know
the law also; but to them not only Grace, but this as well is
covered with a shadow; “For until this day the same veil upon the
reading of the old covenant remaineth,” he saith, it “not being
revealed that it is done away in Christ.” Now what he saith is
this. This very thing they cannot see, that it is brought to an
end, because they believe not Christ. For if it be brought to an
end by Christ, as in truth it is brought to an end, and this the
Law said by anticipation, how will they who receive not Christ that
hath done away the Law, be able to see that the Law is done away? 
And being incapable of seeing this, it is very plain that even of
the Law itself which asserted these things, they know not the power
nor the full glory. ‘And where,’ saith one, ‘did it say
this that it is done away in Christ?’ It did not say it merely,
but also showed it by what was done. And first indeed by shutting
up its sacrifices and its whole ritual<note place="end" n="582" id="v.vii-p30.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.vii-p31"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.vii-p31.1">ἁ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.vii-p31.2">γιστείαν</span>.</p></note> in one place, the Temple, and
afterwards destroying this. For had He not meant to bring these
to an end and the whole of the Law concerning them, He would have
done one or other of two things; either not destroyed the Temple,
or having destroyed it, not forbidden to sacrifice elsewhere.
But, as it is, the whole world and even Jerusalem itself He hath
made forbidden ground for such religious rites; having allowed and
appointed for them only the Temple. Then having destroyed this
itself afterwards He showed completely even by what was done that
the things of the Law are brought to an end by Christ; for the
Temple also Christ destroyed. But if thou wilt see in words as
well how the Law is done away in Christ, hear the Lawgiver himself
speaking thus; “A Prophet shall the Lord raise up unto you of
your brethren, like unto me; (<scripRef passage="Deut. xvii. 15, 19" id="v.vii-p31.3" parsed="|Deut|17|15|0|0;|Deut|17|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Deut.17.15 Bible:Deut.17.19">Deut. xvii. 15, 19</scripRef>.) Him shall ye hear in
all things whatsoever He shall command you. And it shall come to
pass, that every soul which will not hear that Prophet shall be
utterly destroyed<note place="end" n="583" id="v.vii-p31.4"><p class="endnote" id="v.vii-p32"> So Chrysostom, though the LXX agrees with the
E.V.</p></note>.”
(<scripRef passage="Acts iii. 22, 23" id="v.vii-p32.1" parsed="|Acts|3|22|3|23" osisRef="Bible:Acts.3.22-Acts.3.23">Acts iii. 22,
23</scripRef>.) Seest thou how the
Law showed that it is done away in Christ? For this Prophet, that
is, Christ according to the flesh, Whom Moses commanded them to
hear, made to cease both sabbath and circumcision and all the other
things. And David too, showing the very same thing, said
concerning Christ, “Thou art a Priest after the order of
Melchizedek,” (<scripRef passage="Ps. cx. 4" id="v.vii-p32.2" parsed="|Ps|110|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.110.4">Ps. cx.
4</scripRef>;) not after the order
of Aaron. Wherefore also Paul, giving a clear interpretation of
this, says, “The priesthood being changed, there is made of
necessity a change also of the Law.” (<scripRef passage="Heb. vii. 12" id="v.vii-p32.3" parsed="|Heb|7|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Heb.7.12">Heb. vii. 12</scripRef>.) And in another place also
he says again, “Sacrifice and offering thou wouldst not. In
whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin Thou hadst had no
pleasure: then said I, Lo, I come.”  (<scripRef passage="Heb. x. 5, 7" id="v.vii-p32.4" parsed="|Heb|10|5|0|0;|Heb|10|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Heb.10.5 Bible:Heb.10.7">Heb. x. 5, 7</scripRef>.) And other testimonies far
more numerous than these may be adduced out of the Old Testament,
showing how the Law is done away by Christ. So that when thou
shalt have forsaken the Law, thou shalt then see the Law clearly;
but so long as thou holdest by it and believest not Christ, thou
knowest not even the Law itself. Wherefore also he added, to
establish this very thing more clearly;</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.vii-p33"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 3.15" id="v.vii-p33.1" parsed="|2Cor|3|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.3.15">Ver. 15</scripRef>. “But even unto this day,
whensoever Moses is read, a veil lieth upon their heart.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.vii-p34">For since he said that in the reading of the Old
Testament the veil remaineth, lest any should think that this that
is said is from the obscurity of the Law, he both by other things
showed even before what his meaning was, (for by saying, “their
minds were hardened,” he shows that the fault was their own,)
and, in this place too, again. For he said not, ‘The veil
remaineth on the writing,’ but “in the reading;” (now the
reading is the act of those that read;) and again, “When Moses is
read.” He showed this however with greater clearness in the
expression which follows next, saying unreservedly, “The veil
lieth upon their heart.” For even upon the face of Moses it
lay, not because of Moses, but because of the grossness and carnal
mind of these.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.vii-p35">[4.] Having then suitably<note place="end" n="584" id="v.vii-p35.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.vii-p36"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.vii-p36.1">ἱ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.vii-p36.2">κανῶς</span>.</p></note> accused them, he points out also
the manner of their correction. And what is this?</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.vii-p37"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 3.16" id="v.vii-p37.1" parsed="|2Cor|3|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.3.16">Ver. 16</scripRef>. “Nevertheless when
[one] shall turn to the Lord,” which is, to forsake the Law,
“the veil is taken away<note place="end" n="585" id="v.vii-p37.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.vii-p38"> [There are various methods of supplying a
nominative to the verb “turn” in this sentence. Calvin makes
Moses the subject, as representing the law which when it is
directed to Christ causes the veil to be removed. Stanley also
makes Moses the subject, but as representing the people, and
renders, “When Moses turns to the Lord, he strips off the
veil.” But Chrysostom gives what is the generally accepted
view, which is that “the heart of Israel is that which turns,”
indicating of course a general conversion (cf. 
<scripRef passage="Rom. xi. 26" id="v.vii-p38.1" parsed="|Rom|11|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.11.26">Rom. xi. 26</scripRef>) yet including the case of
each individual that turns to Christ. As Beet well says, “The
Apostle cannot leave his people in their darkness without
expressing a hope that they will some day come to the light.”
C.]</p></note>.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.vii-p39">Seest thou that not over the face of Moses was there
that veil, but over the eyesight of the 
<pb n="313" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_313.html" id="v.vii-Page_313" />Jews? For it was done, not that the glory
of Moses might be hidden, but that the Jews might not see. For
they were not capable. So that in them was the deficiency, for
it<note place="end" n="586" id="v.vii-p39.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.vii-p40"> Or, “He.”</p></note> caused not
him to be ignorant of any thing, but them. And he did not say
indeed, “when thou shalt let go the Law,” but he implied it,
for “when thou shalt turn to the Lord, the veil is taken
away.” To the very last he<note place="end" n="587" id="v.vii-p40.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.vii-p41"> St. Paul.</p></note> kept to the history. For when
Moses talked with the Jews he kept his face covered; but when he
turned to God it was uncovered. Now this was a type of that which
was to come to pass, that when we have turned to the Lord, then we
shall see the glory of the Law, and the face of the Lawgiver bare;
yea rather, not this alone, but we shall then be even in the same
rank with Moses. Seest thou how he inviteth the Jew unto the
faith, by showing, that by coming unto Grace he is able not only to
see Moses, but also to stand in the very same rank with the
Lawgiver. ‘For not only,’ he saith, ‘shalt thou look on the
glory which then thou sawest not, but thou shalt thyself also be
included in the same glory; yea rather, in a greater glory, even so
great that that other shall not seem glory at all when compared
with this.’ How and in what manner? ‘Because that when thou
hast turned to the Lord and art included in the grace, thou wilt
enjoy that glory, unto which the glory of Moses, if compared, is so
much less as to be no glory at all. But still, small though it be
and exceedingly below that other, whilst thou art a Jew, even this
will not be vouchsafed thee<note place="end" n="588" id="v.vii-p41.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.vii-p42"> Two <span class="c18" id="v.vii-p42.1">mss</span>. insert
here, “the Jews of that day therefore saw it not, nor do they
now;” but Dr. Field rejects the insertion.</p></note>; but having become a believer, it
will then be vouchsafed thee to behold even that which is far
greater than it.’ And when he was addressing himself to the
believers, he said, that “that which was made glorious had no
glory;” but here he speaks not so; but how? “When one shall
turn to the Lord, the veil is taken away:” leading him up by
little and little, and first setting him in Moses’ rank, and then
making him partake of the greater things. For when thou hast seen
Moses in glory, then afterwards thou shalt also turn unto God and
enjoy this greater glory.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.vii-p43">[5.] See then from the beginning, how many things
he has laid down, as constituting the difference and showing the
superiority, not the enmity or contradiction, of the New Covenant
in respect to the old. That, saith he, is letter, and stone, and
a ministration of death, and is done away: and yet the Jews were
not even vouchsafed this glory. (Or, the glory of this.) This
table is of the flesh, and spirit, and righteousness, and
remaineth; and unto all of us is it vouchsafed, not to one only, as
to Moses of the lesser then. (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. 3.18" id="v.vii-p43.1" parsed="|2Cor|3|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.3.18">ver. 18</scripRef>.) “For,” saith he,
“we all with unveiled face reflecting<note place="end" n="589" id="v.vii-p43.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.vii-p44"> This version of the verb was followed by
Luther, Bengel and others, and is found in the Revised Version.
It is objected to by Meyer, Hodge, Beet <i>et al</i>., as being at
variance with the usage of the language since the middle voice of
the verb never has this meaning elsewhere, and at variance with the
context which lays the stress on free and unhindered seeing and not
upon reflecting. But it is urged in reply that Chrysostom may be
trusted to know what Greek usage is, and as to the context the
splendor which shone in Moses’s face, that which suggested this
whole train of thought, was a reflection of what he saw in the
Mount. Fortunately whichever way the point is decided, the
blessed result remains for all believers of a growing
transformation into the image of Christ, from glory to glory (like
<i>from strength to strength</i> in

glory to another,—a process going on without intermission under
the influence of the Lord, the Spirit. C.]</p></note> as a mirror the glory of the
Lord,” not that of Moses. But since some maintain that the
expression, “when one shall turn to the Lord,” is spoken of the
Son, in contradiction to what is quite acknowledged; let us examine
the point more accurately, having first stated the ground on which
they think to establish this. What then is this? Like, saith
one, as it is said, “God is a Spirit;” (<scripRef passage="John iv. 24" id="v.vii-p44.2" parsed="|John|4|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.4.24">John iv. 24</scripRef>.) so also here, ‘The Lord is
a Spirit.’ But he did not say, ‘The Lord is a Spirit,’ but,
“The Spirit is the Lord.” And there is a great difference
between this construction and that. For when he is desirous of
speaking so as you say, he does not join the article to the
predicate. And besides, let us review all his discourse from the
first, of whom hath he spoken? for instance, when he said, “The
letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth life:” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. 3.6" id="v.vii-p44.3" parsed="|2Cor|3|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.3.6">ver. 6</scripRef>.) and again, “Written not
with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God;” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. 3.3" id="v.vii-p44.4" parsed="|2Cor|3|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.3.3">ver. 3</scripRef>.) was he speaking of God, or
of the Spirit? It is very plain that it was of the Spirit; for
unto It he was calling them from the letter. For lest any,
hearing of the Spirit, and then reflecting that Moses turned unto
the Lord, but himself unto the Spirit, should think himself to have
the worse, to correct such a suspicion as this, he says,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.vii-p45"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 3.17" id="v.vii-p45.1" parsed="|2Cor|3|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.3.17">Ver. 17</scripRef>. “Now the Spirit is the
Lord.” This too is Lord, he says. And that you may know that
he is speaking of the Paraclete, he added,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.vii-p46">“And where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is
liberty.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.vii-p47">For surely you will not assert, that he says, ‘And
where the Lord of the Lord is.’ “Liberty,” he said, with
reference to the former bondage. Then, that you may not think
that he is speaking of a time to come, he says,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.vii-p48"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 3.18" id="v.vii-p48.1" parsed="|2Cor|3|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.3.18">Ver. 18</scripRef>. “But we all, with
unveiled face, reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.vii-p49">Not that which is brought to an end, but that which
remaineth.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.vii-p50">“Are transformed into the same image from glory to
glory, even as from the Lord the Spirit.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.vii-p51">Seest thou how again he places the Spirit in the
rank of God, (vide infra) <pb n="314" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_314.html" id="v.vii-Page_314" />and
raises them up to the rank of the Apostles. For he said before,
“Ye are the Epistle of Christ;” and here, “But we all with
open face.” Yet they came, like Moses, bringing a law. But
like as we, he says, needed no veil, so neither ye who received
it. And yet, this glory is far greater, for this is not of our
countenance, but of the Spirit; but nevertheless ye are able as
well as we to look steadfastly upon it. For they indeed could not
even by a mediator, but ye even without a mediator can [look
steadfastly on] a greater. They were not able to look upon that
of Moses, ye even upon that of the Spirit. Now had the Spirit
been at all inferior, He would not have set down these things as
greater than those. But what is, “we reflecting as a mirror the
glory of the Lord, are transformed into the same image.” This
indeed was shown more clearly when the gifts of miracles were in
operation; howbeit it is not even now difficult to see it, for one
who hath believing eyes. For as soon as we are baptized, the soul
beameth even more than the sun, being cleansed by the Spirit; and
not only do we behold the glory of God, but from it also receive a
sort of splendor. Just as if pure silver be turned towards the
sun’s rays, it will itself also shoot forth rays, not from its
own natural property merely but also from the solar lustre; so also
doth the soul being cleansed and made brighter than silver, receive
a ray from the glory of the Spirit, and send it back. Wherefore
also he saith, “Reflecting as a mirror we are transformed into
the same image from glory,” that of the Spirit, “to glory,”
our own, that which is generated in us; and that, of such sort, as
one might expect from the Lord the Spirit. See how here also he
calleth the Spirit, Lord. And in other places too one may see
that lordship of His. For, saith he, “As they ministered and
fasted unto the Lord, the Spirit said, Separate me Paul and
Barnabas.” (<scripRef passage="Acts xiii. 2" id="v.vii-p51.1" parsed="|Acts|13|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.13.2">Acts xiii.
2</scripRef>.) For therefore he
said, “as they ministered unto the Lord, Separate me,” in order
to show the [Spirit’s] equality in honor. And again Christ
saith, “The servant knoweth not what his lord doeth;” but even
as a man knoweth his own things, so doth the Spirit know the things
of God; not by being taught [them,] for so the similitude holdeth
not good. Also the working as He willeth showeth His authority
and lordship. This transformeth us. This suffereth not to be
conformed to this world; for such is the creation of which This is
the Author. For as he saith, “Created in Christ Jesus,”
(<scripRef passage="Ephes. ii. 10" id="v.vii-p51.2" parsed="|Eph|2|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Eph.2.10">Ephes. ii. 10</scripRef>.) so saith he, “Create in me
a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit in my inward
parts.” (<scripRef passage="Ps. li. 10" id="v.vii-p51.3" parsed="|Ps|51|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.51.10">Ps. li.
10</scripRef>, LXX.)</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.vii-p52">[6.] Wilt thou that I show thee this also from the
Apostles more obviously to the sense. Consider Paul, whose
garments wrought: Peter, whose very shadows were mighty. (<scripRef passage="Acts xix. 12; v. 15" id="v.vii-p52.1" parsed="|Acts|19|12|0|0;|Acts|5|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.19.12 Bible:Acts.5.15">Acts xix. 12; v. 15</scripRef>. XX.) For had they not borne
a King’s image and their radiancy been unapproachable, their
garments and shadows had not wrought so mightily. For the
garments of a king are terrible even to robbers. Wouldest thou
see this beaming even through the body? “Looking
steadfastly,” said he, “upon the face of Stephen, they saw it
as it had been the face of an angel.” (<scripRef passage="Acts vi. 15" id="v.vii-p52.2" parsed="|Acts|6|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.6.15">Acts vi. 15</scripRef>.) But this was nothing to
the glory flashing within. For what Moses had upon his
countenance, that did these carry about with them on their souls,
yea ‘rather’ even far more. For that of Moses indeed was more
obvious to the senses, but this was incorporeal. And like as
fire-bright bodies streaming down from the shining bodies upon
those which lie near them, impart to them also somewhat of their
own splendor, so truly doth it also happen with the faithful.
Therefore surely they with whom it is thus are set free from earth,
and have their dreams of the things in the heavens. Woe is me!
for well is it that we should here even groan bitterly, for that we
who enjoy a birth so noble do not so much as know what is said,
because we quickly lose the reality, and are dazzled about the
objects of sense. For this glory, the unspeakable and awful,
remaineth in us for a day or two, and then we quench it, bringing
over it the winter of worldly concerns, and with the thickness of
those clouds repelling its rays. For worldly things are a winter,
and than winter more lowering. For not frost is engendered thence
nor rain, neither doth it produce mire and deep swamps; but, things
than all these more grievous, it formeth hell and the miseries of
hell. And as in severe frost all the limbs are stiffened and are
dead, so truly the soul shuddering in the winter of sins also,
performeth none of its proper functions, stiffened, as it were, by
a frost, as to conscience. For what cold is to the body, that an
evil conscience is to the soul, whence also cometh cowardice. For
nothing is more cowardly than the man that is rivetted to worldly
things; for such an one lives the life of Cain, trembling every
day. And why do I mention deaths, and losses, and offences, and
flatteries, and services? for even without these he is in fear of
ten thousand vicissitudes. And his coffers indeed are full of
gold, but his soul is not freed from the fear of poverty. And
very reasonably. For he is moored as it were on rotten and
swiftly shifting things, and even though in his own case he
experienced not the reverse, yet is he undone by seeing it happen
in others; and great is his 
<pb n="315" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_315.html" id="v.vii-Page_315" />cowardice, great his unmanliness. For not only
is such an one spiritless as to danger, but also as to all other
things. And if desire of wealth assail him, he doth not like a
free man beat off the assault; but like a bought slave, doth all
[it bids], serving the love of money as it were a severe
mistress. If again he have beheld some comely damsel, down he
croucheth at once made captive, and followeth like a raging dog,
though it behoveth to do the opposite. For when thou hast beheld
a beautiful woman, consider not how thou mayest enjoy thy lust, but
how be delivered from thy lust. ‘And how is this possible,’
saith one? ‘for loving is not my own doing.’ Whose then? tell
me. It is from the Devil’s malice. Thou art quite convinced
that that which plotteth against thee is a devil; wrestle then and
fight with a distemper. But I cannot, he saith. Come then, let
us first teach thee this, that what happeneth is from thine own
listlessness, and that thou at the first gavest entrance to the
Devil, and now if thou hast a mind, with much ease mayest drive him
off. They that commit adultery, is it from lust they commit it,
or simply from desire of dangers? Plainly from lust. Do they
then therefore obtain forgiveness? Certainly not. Why not? 
Because the sin is their own.  ‘But,’ saith one, ‘why, pray,
string syllogisms? For my conscience bears me witness that I wish
to repel the passion; and cannot, but it keepeth close, presses me
sore, and afflicts me grievously.’ O man, thou dost wish to
repel it, but thou dost not the things repellers should do; but it
is with thee just as with a man in a fever, who drinking of cold
streams to the fill, should say, ‘How many things I devise with
the wish to quench this fever, and I cannot; but they stir up my
flame the more.’ Let us see then whether at all thou too dost
the things that inflame, yet thinkest thou art devising such as
quench. ‘I do not,’ he saith. Tell me then, what hast thou
ever essayed to do in order to quench the passion? and what is it,
in fine, that will increase the passion? For even supposing we be
not all of us obnoxious to these particular charges; (for more may
be found who are captivated by the love of money than of beauty;)
still the remedy to be proposed will be common to all, both to
these and to those. For both that is an unreasonable passion, and
this, is keener and fiercer than that. When then we have proved
victorious over the greater, it is very plain that we shall easily
subdue the less also. ‘And how is it,’ saith one, ‘that if
this be keener, all persons are not made captive by the vice, but a
greater number are mad after money?’ Because in the first place
this last desire appears to be unattended with danger: next,
although that of beauty be even fiercer, yet it is more speedily
extinguished; for were it to continue like that of money, it would
wholly destroy its captive.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.vii-p53">[7.] Come then, let us discourse to you on
this, the love of beauty, and let us see whereby the mischief is
increased; for so we shall know whether the fault be ours, or not
ours. And if ours, let us do everything to get the better of it;
whereas if not ours, why do we afflict ourselves for nought? And
why do we not pardon, but find fault, with those who are made
captive by it? Whence then is this love engendered? ‘From
comeliness of feature,’ saith one, ‘when she that woundeth one
is beautiful and of fair countenance.’ It is said idly and in
vain. For if it were beauty that attracted lovers, then would the
maiden who is such have all men for her lovers; but if she hath not
all, this thing cometh not of nature nor from beauty, but from
unchaste eyes. For it was when by eyeing too curiously<note place="end" n="590" id="v.vii-p53.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.vii-p54"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.vii-p54.1">περιέργως</span>.</p></note>, thou didst
admire and become enamored, that thou receivedst the shaft.
‘And who,’ saith one, ‘when he sees a beautiful woman, can
refrain from commending her he sees? If then admiring such things
cometh not of deliberate choice, it follows that love depends not
on ourselves.’ Stop, O man!  Why dost thou crowd all things
together, running round and round on every side, and not choosing
to see the root of the evil? For I see numbers admiring and
commending, who yet are not enamored. ‘And how is it possible
to admire and not be enamored?’ Clamor not, (for this I am
coming to speak of,) but wait, and thou shalt hear Moses admiring
the son of Jacob, and saying, “And Joseph was a goodly person,
and well favored exceedingly.” (<scripRef passage="Gen. xxxix. 6" id="v.vii-p54.2" parsed="|Gen|39|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.39.6">Gen. xxxix. 6</scripRef>, LXX.) Was he then enamored
who speaketh this? By no means. ‘For,’ saith he, ‘he did
not even see him whom he commended.’ We are affected, however,
somewhat similarly towards beauties also which are described to us,
not only which are beheld. But that thou cavil not with us on
this point:—David, was he not comely exceedingly, and ruddy with
beauty of eyes? (So <scripRef passage="1 Sam. 16.12; 17.42" id="v.vii-p54.3" parsed="|1Sam|16|12|0|0;|1Sam|17|42|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Sam.16.12 Bible:1Sam.17.42">1 Sam. xvi. 12 &amp; xvii. 42</scripRef>. LXX.) and indeed this beauty
of the eyes, is even especially, a component of beauteousness of
more despotic power than any. Was then any one enamored of him? 
By no means. Then to be also enamored cometh not [necessarily]
with admiring. For many too have had mothers blooming exceedingly
in beauty of person. What then? Were their children enamored of
them? Away with the thought! but they admire what they see, yet
fall not into a shameful love. ‘No, for again this good
provision is 
<pb n="316" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_316.html" id="v.vii-Page_316" />Nature’s.’ How Nature’s? Tell
me. ‘Because they are mothers,’ he saith. Then hearest thou
not that Persians, and that without any compulsion, have
intercourse with their own mothers, and that not one or two
individuals, but a whole nation? But independent of these, it is
hence also evident that this distemper cometh not from bloom of
person nor from beauty merely, but from a listless and wandering
soul. Many at least it is certain, oftentimes, having passed over
thousands of well-favored women, have given themselves to such as
were plainer. Whence it is evident that love depends not on
beauty: for otherwise, surely, those would have caught such as
fell into it, before these. What then is its cause? ‘For,’
saith he, ‘if it be not beauty that causeth love, whence hath it
its beginning and its root? From a wicked Demon?’ It hath it
indeed, thence also, but this is not what we are inquiring about,
but whether we ourselves too be not the cause. For the plot is
not theirs only, but along with them our own too in the first
place. For from no other source is this wicked distemper so
engendered as from habit, and flattering words, and leisure, and
idleness, and having nothing to do. For great, great is the
tyranny of habit, even so great as to be moulded into<note place="end" n="591" id="v.vii-p54.4"><p class="endnote" id="v.vii-p55"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.vii-p55.1">καθίστασθαι</span>. Ben. <span class="Greek" id="v.vii-p55.2">μεθίστασθαι</span>, to pass into.</p></note> a necessity
of nature. Now if it be habit’s to gender it, it is very
evident that it is also [habit’s] to extinguish it. Certain it
is at least that many have in this way ceased to be enamored, from
not seeing those they were enamored of. Now this for a little
while indeed appears to be a bitter thing and exceedingly
unpleasant; but in time it becometh pleasant, and even were they to
wish it, they could not afterwards resume the passion.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.vii-p56">[8.] How then, when without habit one is
taken captive at first sight? Here also it is indolence of body,
or self-indulgence, and not attending to one’s duties, nor being
occupied in necessary business. For such an one, wandering about
like some vagabond, is transfixed by any wickedness; and like a
child let loose, any one that liketh maketh such a soul his
slave. For since it is its wont to be at work, when thou stoppest
its workings in what is good, seeing it cannot be unemployed, it is
compelled to engender what is otherwise. For just as the earth,
when it is not sown nor planted, sends up simply weeds; so also the
soul, when it hath nought of necessary things to do, being desirous
by all means to be doing, giveth herself unto wicked deeds. And
as the eye never ceaseth from seeing, and therefore will see wicked
things, when good things are not set before it; so also doth the
thought, when it secludes itself from necessary things, busy itself
thereafter about such as are unprofitable. For that even the
first assault occupation and thought are able to beat off, is
evident from many things. When then thou hast looked on a
beautiful woman, and wert moved towards her, look no more, and thou
art delivered. ‘And how shall I be able to look no more,’
saith he, ‘when drawn by that desire?’ Give thyself to other
things which may distract the soul, to books, to necessary cares,
to protecting others, to assisting the injured, to prayers, to the
wisdom which considers the things to come: with such things as
these bind down thy soul. By these means, not only shalt thou
cure a recent wound, but shalt wear away a confirmed and inveterate
one easily. For if an insult according to the proverb prevails
with the lover to give over his love, how shall not these spiritual
charms<note place="end" n="592" id="v.vii-p56.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.vii-p57"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.vii-p57.1">ἐ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.vii-p57.2">πῳδαὶ</span>.</p></note> much rather
be victorious over the evil, if only we have a mind to stand
aloof. But if we are always conversing and associating with those
who shoot such arrows at us, and talking with them and hearing what
they say, we cherish the distemper. How then dost thou expect the
fire to be quenched, when day by day thou stirrest up the
flame?</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.vii-p58">And let this that we have said about habit be our
speech unto the young; since to those who are men and taught in
heavenly wisdom, stronger than all is the fear of God, the
remembrance of hell, the desire of the kingdom of heaven; for these
are able to quench the fire. And along with these take that
thought also, that what thou seest is nothing else than rheum, and
blood, and juices of decomposed food. ‘Yet a gladsome thing is
the bloom of the features,’ saith one. But nothing is more
gladsome than the blossoms of the earth, and these too rot and
wither. Do not then in this either give heed to the bloom, but
pass on further inward in thy thought, and stripping off that
beauteous skin in thy thought, scan curiously what lies beneath
it. For even the bodies of the dropsical shine brightly, and the
surface hath nothing offensive; but still, shocked with the thought
of the humor stored within we cannot love such persons. ‘But
languishing is the eye and glancing, and beautifully arched the
brow, and dark the lashes, and soft the eyeball, and serene the
look.’ But see how even this itself again is nothing else than
nerves, and veins, and membranes, and arteries. Think too, I
pray, of this beautiful eye, when diseased and old, wasting with
despair, swelling with anger, how hateful to the sight it is, how
quickly it perisheth, how sooner even than pictured ones, it is
effaced. From these things make thy mind pass to the true
beauty. ‘But,’ saith he, ‘ I do not see beauty <pb n="317" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_317.html" id="v.vii-Page_317" />of soul.’ But if thou wilt
choose, thou shalt see it: and as the absent beautiful may be
with the mind admired, though with one’s eyes unseen, so it is
possible to see without eyes beauty of soul. Hast thou not often
sketched a beauteous form, and felt moved unto the drawing? Image
also now beauty of soul, and revel in that loveliness. ‘But,’
saith he, ‘I do not see things incorporeal.’ And yet we see
these, rather than the corporeal, with the mind. Therefore it is,
for instance, that although we see them not, we admire angels also
and archangels, and habits of character, and virtue of soul. And
if thou seest a man considerate and moderate, thou wilt more admire
him than that beautiful countenance. And if thou seest one
insulted, yet bearing it; wronged, yet giving way, admire and love
such, even though they be striken in age. For such a thing is the
beauty of the soul; even in old age it hath many enamored of it,
and it never fadeth, but bloometh for ever. In order then that we
also may gain this beauty, let us go in quest of those that have
it, and be enamored of them. For so shall we too be able, when we
have attained this beauty, to obtain the good things eternal,
whereof may all we partake, through the grace and love towards men
of our Lord Jesus Christ, with Whom to the Father, with the Holy
Spirit, be glory and might, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

down that swelling; yet not to do it away, since this would be a

he manages this in another manner, by showing that not of their own
merits was it, but all of the loving-kindness of God. Wherefore
also he says, “Therefore seeing we have this ministry.” For
nothing more did we contribute, except that we became ministers,
and made ourselves subservient to the things given by God.
Wherefore he said not ‘largess<note place="end" n="596" id="v.viii-p7.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.viii-p8"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.viii-p8.1">παροχὴν</span>.</p></note>,’ nor ‘supply<note place="end" n="597" id="v.viii-p8.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.viii-p9"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.viii-p9.1">χορηγίαν</span>.</p></note>,’ but ‘ministry.’ Nor was
he contented with this even, but added, “as we obtained
mercy.” For even this itself, he saith, the ministering to
these things, is of mercy and loving-kindness. Yet it is
mercy’s to deliver from evils, not to give so many good things
besides: but the mercy of God includes this also.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.viii-p10">“We faint not.” And this indeed is to be
imputed to His loving-kindness. For the clause, “as we obtained
mercy,” take to be said with reference both to the
“ministry,” and to the words, “we faint not.”  And observe
how earnestly he endeavors to lower his own things. ‘For,’
saith he, ‘that one who hath been counted worthy of such and so
great things, and this from mercy only and loving-kindness, should
show forth such labors, and undergo dangers, and endure
temptations, is no great matter. Therefore we not only do not
sink down, but we even rejoice and speak boldly.’ For instance,
having said, “we faint not,” he added,</p>

“But we have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in
craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.viii-p12">And what are “the hidden things of shame?” We
do not, he saith, profess and promise great things, and in our
actions show other things, as they do; wherefore also he said,
“Ye look on things after the outward appearance;” but such we
are as we appear, not having any duplicity, nor saying and doing
such things as we ought to hide and veil over with shame and
blushes. And to interpret this, he added, “not walking in
craftiness.” For what they considered to be praise, that he
proves to be shameful and worthy of scorn. But what is, “in
craftiness?” They had the reputation of taking nothing,, but
they took and kept it secret; they had the character of saints and
approved Apostles, but they were full of numberless evil things.
But, saith he, “we have renounced” these things: (for these
are what he also calls the “hidden things of shame;” <pb n="318" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_318.html" id="v.viii-Page_318" />being such as we appear to be, and
keeping nothing veiled over. And that not in this [our] life
only, but also in the Preaching itself. For this is, “nor
handling the word of God deceitfully.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.viii-p13">“But by the manifestation of the truth.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.viii-p14">Not by the countenance and the outward show, but by

<p class="c19" id="v.viii-p15">“Commending ourselves to every man’s

<p class="c19" id="v.viii-p16">For not to believers only, but also to
unbelievers, we are manifest; lying open unto all that they may
test our actions, as they may choose; and by this we commend
ourselves, not by acting a part and carrying about a specious
mask. We say then, that we take nothing, and we call you for
witnesses; we say that we are conscious of no wickedness, and of
this again we derive the testimony from you, not as they (sc. false
Apostles) who, veiling over their things, deceive many. But we
both set forth our life before all men; and we lay bare<note place="end" n="598" id="v.viii-p16.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.viii-p17"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.viii-p17.1">ἀ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.viii-p17.2">πογυμνοῦμεν</span>.</p></note> the

<p class="c19" id="v.viii-p18">[2.] Then because the unbelievers knew not its
power, he added, this is no fault of ours, but of their own
insensibility. Wherefore also he saith,</p>

veiled, it is veiled in them that are lost; in whom the God of this
world hath blinded the eyes of the unbelieving.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.viii-p20">As he said also before, “To some a savor from
death unto death, to others a savor from life unto life,” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. 2.16" id="v.viii-p20.1" parsed="|2Cor|2|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.2.16">ch. ii.
16</scripRef>.) so he saith
here too. But what is “the God of this world?” Those that
are infected with Marcion’s notions<note place="end" n="599" id="v.viii-p20.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.viii-p21"> See Epiphanius <i>adv. Hær</i>. lib. i. tom.
iii. 33.</p></note>, affirm that this is said of the
Creator, the just only, and not good; for they say that there is a
certain God, just and not good. But the Manichees<note place="end" n="600" id="v.viii-p21.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.viii-p22"> For a full account of Manichæism, see <i>
Library of the Fathers</i>, St. Augustin’s <i>Confessions</i>,
Note A.</p></note> say that the
devil is here intended, desiring from this passage to introduce
another creator of the world besides the True One, very
senselessly. For the Scripture useth often to employ the term
God, not in regard of the dignity of that so designated, but of the
weakness of those in subjection to it; as when it calls Mammon
lord, and the belly god. But neither is the belly therefore God,
nor Mammon Lord, save only of those who bow down themselves to
them. But we assert of this passage that it is spoken neither of
the devil nor of another creator, but of the God of the Universe,
and that it is to be read thus; “God hath blinded the minds of
the unbelievers of this world<note place="end" n="601" id="v.viii-p22.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.viii-p23"> [This is one of the few instances in which
the expositor allowed himself to be diverted by dogmatic
considerations from the true meaning of the word. It is
exceedingly awkward to make <i>of this world</i> depend upon
unbelievers, and not upon the substantive <i>God</i> which
immediately precedes. The natural and legitimate construction is
the one given in both the English versions, “the God of this
world (or age).” But Chrysostom was led to depart from it, as
Augustin was afterwards, and Origen and Tertullian had been before,
by a desire to resist the Marcionites and the Manichæans who were
accustomed to quote this passage in favor of their doctrine of two
eternal principles, the one good, the other evil. But the
ordinary rendering of the phrase gives no countenance to the <i>
Dualism</i>, which for so many centuries opposed and embarrassed
the early Church. It is, alas, too certain that Satan rules this
world as if he were a God, and from the multitude he receives the
service which is due to the Most High alone, but this fact by no
means exalts him to an equality with the maker of all or makes him
an original and co-eternal principle of life and action. It is
because men turn away from the glory of God as it shines in the
face of Jesus Christ that God permits Satan to destroy, in whole or
in part, their capacity for spiritual vision. Such a work is
eminently appropriate in him who is prince of “the world-rulers
of this darkness” (<scripRef passage="Ephes. vi. 12" id="v.viii-p23.1" parsed="|Eph|6|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Eph.6.12">Ephes. vi. 12</scripRef> Rev. Ver.), and the element of
whose being is deceit and falsehood. C.]</p></note>.” For the world to come hath no
unbelievers; but the present only. But if any one should read it
even otherwise, as, for instance, “the God of this world;”
neither doth this afford any handle, for this doth not show Him to
be the God of this world only. For He is called “the God of
Heaven,” (<scripRef passage="Ps. cxxxvi. 26" id="v.viii-p23.2" parsed="|Ps|136|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.136.26">Ps.
cxxxvi. 26</scripRef>. &amp;c.) yet
is He not the God of Heaven only; and we say, ‘God of the present
day;’ yet we say this not as limiting His power to it alone.
And moreover He is called the “God of Abraham, and the God of
Isaac, and the God of Jacob;” (<scripRef passage="Exod. iii. 6" id="v.viii-p23.3" parsed="|Exod|3|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Exod.3.6">Exod. iii. 6</scripRef>. &amp;c.) and yet He is not
the God of them alone. And one may find many other like
testimonies in the Scriptures. How then “hath” He
“blinded” them? Not by working unto this end; away with the
thought! but by suffering and allowing it. For it is usual with
the Scripture so to speak, as when it saith, “God gave them up
unto a reprobate mind.” For when they themselves first
disbelieved, and rendered themselves unworthy to see the mysteries;
He Himself also thereafter permitted it. But what did it behove
Him to do? To draw them by force, and reveal to those who would
not see? But so they would have despised the more, and would not
have seen either. Wherefore also he added,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.viii-p24">“That the light of the Gospel of the glory of
Christ should not dawn upon them.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.viii-p25">Not that they might disbelieve in God, but that
unbelief might not see what are the things within, as also He
enjoined us, commanding not to “cast the pearls before the
swine.” (<scripRef passage="Matt. vii. 6" id="v.viii-p25.1" parsed="|Matt|7|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.7.6">Matt. vii.
6</scripRef>.) For had He
revealed even to those who disbelieve, their disease would have
been the rather aggravated. For if one compel a man laboring
under ophthalmia to look at the sunbeams, he the rather increases
his infirmity. Therefore the physicians<note place="end" n="602" id="v.viii-p25.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.viii-p26"> Literally “physicians’ sons.”</p></note> even shut them up in darkness, so
as not to aggravate their disorder. So then here also we must
consider that these persons indeed became unbelievers of
themselves, but having become so, they no longer saw the secret
things of the Gospel, God thenceforth excluding its beams from
them. <pb n="319" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_319.html" id="v.viii-Page_319" />As also he
said to the disciples, “Therefore I speak unto them in proverbs<note place="end" n="603" id="v.viii-p26.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.viii-p27"> Rec. Text “parables.”</p></note>,
(<scripRef passage="Matt. xiii. 13" id="v.viii-p27.1" parsed="|Matt|13|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.13.13">Matt. xiii.
13</scripRef>.) because
hearing they hear not.” But what I say may also become clearer
by an example; suppose a Greek, accounting our religion<note place="end" n="604" id="v.viii-p27.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.viii-p28"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.viii-p28.1">τὰ ἡμέτερα</span>.</p></note> to be
fables. This man then, how will he be more advantaged? by going
in and seeing the mysteries, or<note place="end" n="605" id="v.viii-p28.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.viii-p29"> Or “than.”</p></note> by remaining without? Therefore
he says, “That the light should not dawn upon them,” still
dwelling on the history of Moses. For what happened to the Jews
in his case, this happeneth to all unbelievers in the case of the
Gospel. And what is that which is overshadowed, and which is not
illuminated unto them? Hear him saying, “That the light of the
glorious Gospel of Christ who is the Image of God, should not dawn
upon them.” Namely, that the Cross is the salvation of the
world, and His glory; that this Crucified One himself is about to
come with much splendor; all the other things, those present, those
to come, those seen, those not seen, the unspeakable splendor of
the things looked for. Therefore also he said, “dawn,” that
thou mayest not look for the whole here, for that which is [here]
given is only, as it were, a little dawning of the Spirit.
Therefore, also above as indicating this, he spoke of “savor;”
(c. <scripRef passage="2 Cor. 2.16" id="v.viii-p29.1" parsed="|2Cor|2|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.2.16">ii. 16</scripRef>.)
and again, “earnest,” (c. <scripRef passage="2 Cor. 1.25" id="v.viii-p29.2" parsed="|2Cor|1|25|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.1.25">i. 25</scripRef>.) showing that the greater
part remaineth there.  But nevertheless all these things have been
hidden from them; but had been hidden because they disbelieved
first. Then to show that they are not only ignorant of the Glory
of Christ, but of the Father’s also, since they know not His, he
added, “Who is the Image of God?” For do not halt at Christ
only. For as by Him thou seest the Father, so if thou art
ignorant of His Glory, neither wilt thou know the Father’s.</p>

ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your servants
for Jesus’ sake.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.viii-p31">And what is the nature of the connexion
there? What hath this in common with what has been said? He
either hints at them<note place="end" n="606" id="v.viii-p31.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.viii-p32"> Sc. the false Apostles.</p></note> as exalting themselves, and
persuading the disciples to name themselves after them: as he
said in the former Epistle, “I am of Paul and I of Apollos;” or
else another thing of the gravest character. What then is this? 
Seeing that they waged fierce war against them, and plotted against
them on every side; ‘Is it,’ he says, ‘with us ye fight and
war? [Nay but] with Him that is preached by us, “for we preach
not ourselves.” I am a servant, I am [but] a minister even of
those who receive the Gospel, transacting every thing for Another,
and for His glory doing whatsover I do. So that in warring
against me thou throwest down what is His. For so far am I from
turning to my own personal advantage any part of the Gospel, that I
will not refuse to be even your servant for Christ’s sake; seeing
it seemed good to Him so to honor you, seeing He so loved you and
did all things for you.’ Wherefore also he saith, “and
ourselves your servants for Christ’s sake.” Seest thou a soul
pure from glory? ‘For in truth,’ saith he, ‘we not only do
not take to ourselves<note place="end" n="607" id="v.viii-p32.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.viii-p33"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.viii-p33.1">νοσφιζόμεθα</span>.</p></note> aught of our Master’s, but even
to you we submit ourselves for His sake.’</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.viii-p34"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 4.6" id="v.viii-p34.1" parsed="|2Cor|4|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.4.6">Ver. 6</scripRef>. “Seeing it is God

hearts.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.viii-p36">Seest thou how again to those who were
desirous of seeing that surpassing glory, I mean that of Moses, he
shows it flashing with added lustre<note place="end" n="609" id="v.viii-p36.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.viii-p37"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.viii-p37.1">μετὰ προσθήκης</span>.</p></note>? ‘As upon the face of Moses, so
also hath it shined unto your hearts,’ he saith. And first, he
puts them in mind of what was made in the beginning of the
Creation, sensible light and darkness sensible, showing that this
creation is greater. And where commanded He light to shine out of
darkness? In the beginning and in prelude to the Creation; for,
saith he, “Darkness was upon the face of the deep. And God
said, Let there be light, and there was light.” Howbeit then
indeed He said, “Let it be, and it was:” but now He said
nothing, but Himself became Light for us. For he<note place="end" n="610" id="v.viii-p37.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.viii-p38"> The Apostle.</p></note> said not,
‘hath also now commanded,’ but “hath” Himself
“shined.” Therefore neither do we see sensible objects by the
shining of this Light, but God Himself through Christ. Seest thou
the invariableness<note place="end" n="611" id="v.viii-p38.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.viii-p39"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.viii-p39.1">ἀ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.viii-p39.2">παράλλακτον</span>.</p></note> in the Trinity? For of the
Spirit, he says, “But we all with unveiled face reflecting in a
mirror the glory of the Lord, are transformed into the same image
from glory to glory even as from the Lord the Spirit.”
(c. <scripRef passage="2 Cor. 3.18" id="v.viii-p39.3" parsed="|2Cor|3|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.3.18">iii. 18</scripRef>.) And of the Son; “That

“He that said Light shall shine out of darkness shined in your
hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in
the face of Christ.” For as when he had said, “Of the Gospel
of the glory of Christ,” he added, “Who is the Image of God,”
showing that they were deprived of His<note place="end" n="612" id="v.viii-p39.5"><p class="endnote" id="v.viii-p40"> God’s.</p></note> glory also; So after saying, “the
knowledge of God,” he added, “in the face of Christ,’ to show
that through Him we know 
<pb n="320" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_320.html" id="v.viii-Page_320" />the Father, even as through the Spirit also we
are brought unto Him.</p>

“But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the exceeding
greatness of the power may be of God, and not from
ourselves.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.viii-p42">For seeing he had spoken many and great things
of the unspeakable glory, lest any should say, ‘And how enjoying
so great a glory remain we in a mortal body?’ he saith, that this
very thing is indeed the chiefest marvel and a very great example
of the power of God, that an earthen vessel hath been enabled to
bear so great a brightness and to keep so high a treasure. And
therefore as admiring this, he said, “That the exceeding
greatness of the power may be of God, and not from ourselves;”
again alluding to those who gloried in themselves. For both the
greatness of the things given and the weakness of them that receive
show His power; in that He not only gave great things, but also to
those who are little. For he used the term “earthen” in
allusion to the frailty<note place="end" n="613" id="v.viii-p42.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.viii-p43"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.viii-p43.1">τὸ εὒθραυστον</span>.</p></note> of our mortal nature, and to
declare the weakness of our flesh. For it is nothing better
constituted than earthenware; so is it soon damaged, and by death
and disease and variations of temperature and ten thousand other
things easily dissolved. And he said these things both to take
down their inflation, and to show to all that none of the things we
hold<note place="end" n="614" id="v.viii-p43.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.viii-p44"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.viii-p44.1">τῶν καθ ἡμᾶς.</span></p></note> is human.
For then is the power of God chiefly conspicuous, when by vile it
worketh mighty things. Wherefore also in another place He said,
“For My power is made perfect in weakness.” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. xii. 9" id="v.viii-p44.2" parsed="|2Cor|12|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.12.9">2 Cor. xii. 9</scripRef>.) And indeed in the
Old [Testament] whole hosts of barbarians were turned to flight by
gnats and flies, wherefore also He calleth the caterpillar His
mighty force<note place="end" n="615" id="v.viii-p44.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.viii-p45"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.viii-p45.1">δύναμιν</span>. LXX. A.V.

(<scripRef passage="Joel ii. 25" id="v.viii-p45.3" parsed="|Joel|2|25|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Joel.2.25">Joel ii. 25</scripRef>.) and in the beginning,
by only confounding tongues, He put a stop to that great tower in
Babylon. And in their wars too, at one time, He routed
innumerable hosts by three hundred men; at another He overthrew
cities by trumpets; and afterwards by a little and poor<note place="end" n="616" id="v.viii-p45.4"><p class="endnote" id="v.viii-p46"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.viii-p46.1">εὕτελοῦς</span>.</p></note> stripling,
David, He turned to flight the whole army of barbarians. So then
here also, sending forth twelve only He overcame the world; twelve,
and those, persecuted, warred against.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.viii-p47">[4.] Let us then be amazed at the Power of
God, admire, adore it. Let us ask Jews, let us ask Greeks, who
persuaded the whole world to desert from their fathers’ usages,
and to go over to another way of life? The fisherman, or the
tentmaker? the publican, or the unlearned and ignorant? And how
can these things stand with reason, except it were Divine Power
which achieveth all by their means? And what too did they say to
persuade them?  ‘Be baptized in the Name of The Crucified.’
Of what kind of man<note place="end" n="617" id="v.viii-p47.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.viii-p48"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.viii-p48.1">Πόιου</span>.</p></note>? One they had not seen nor looked
upon. But nevertheless saying and preaching these things, they
persuaded them that they who gave them oracles, and whom they had
received by tradition from their forefathers, were no Gods: 
whilst this Christ, He Who was nailed [to the wood,] drew them all
unto Himself. And yet that He was indeed crucified and buried,
was manifest in a manner to all; but that He was risen again, none
save a few saw. But still of this too they persuaded those who
had not beheld; and not that He rose again only, but that He
ascended also into Heaven, and cometh to judge quick and dead.
Whence then the persuasiveness of these sayings, tell me? From
nothing else than the Power of God. For, in the first place,
innovation itself<note place="end" n="618" id="v.viii-p48.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.viii-p49"> So one <span class="c18" id="v.viii-p49.1">ms</span>. at any
rate; Ben. “this innovation.”</p></note> was
offensive to all; but when too one innovates in such things, the
matter becomes more grievous: when one tears up<note place="end" n="619" id="v.viii-p49.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.viii-p50"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.viii-p50.1">ἁ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.viii-p50.2">ναμοχλεύῃ</span>.</p></note> the foundations of ancient custom,
when one plucks laws from their seat. And besides all this,
neither did the heralds seem worthy of credit, but they were both
of a nation hated amongst all men, and were timorous and
ignorant. Whence then overcame they the world? Whence cast they
out you, and those your forefathers who were reputed to be
philosophers, along with their very gods? Is it not quite evident
that it was from having God with them? For neither are these
successes of human, but of some divine and unspeakable, power.
‘No,’ saith one, ‘but of witchcraft.’ Then certainly
ought the power of the demons to have increased and the worship of
idols to have extended. How then have they been overthrown and
have vanished, and our things the reverse of these? So that from
this even it is manifest that what was done was the decree of God;
and not from the Preaching only, but also from the title of life
itself. For when was virginity so largely planted every where in
the world? when contempt of wealth, and of life, and of all things
besides? For such as were wicked and wizards, would have effected
nothing like this, but the contrary in all respects: whilst these
introduced amongst us the life of angels; and not introduced
merely, but established it in our own land, in that of the
barbarians, in the very extremities of the earth. Whence it is
manifest that it was the power of Christ every where that effected
all, which every where shineth, and swifter than any lightning
illumeth the hearts of men. All these things, then, considering,
and accepting what hath been done as a clear proof of the
promise <pb n="321" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_321.html" id="v.viii-Page_321" />of the things to
come, worship with us the invincible might of The Crucified, that
ye may both escape the intolerable punishments, and obtain the
everlasting kingdom; of which may all we partake through the grace
and love towards men of our Lord Jesus Christ; to Whom be glory
world without end. Amen.</p>

of his trials? For it both showed the power of God, and more

they bare about? Their daily deaths by which also the
resurrection was showed. ‘For if any believe not,’ he says,
‘that Jesus died and rose again, beholding us every day die and
rise again, let him believe henceforward in the resurrection.’
Seest thou how he has discovered yet another reason for the
trials? What then is this reason? “That his life also may be
manifested in our body.” He says, ‘by snatching us out of the
perils. So that this which seems a mark of weakness and
destitution, this, [I say,] proclaims His resurrection. For His
power had not so appeared in our suffering no unpleasantness, as it
is now shown in our suffering indeed, but without being

So he has done here also, giving a clear interpretation of this
which I have cited. ‘For therefore, “we are delivered,”’
he says, ‘in other words, we bear about His dying that the power
of His life may be made manifest, who permitteth not mortal flesh,
though undergoing so great sufferings, to be overcome by the
snowstorm of these calamities.’ And it may be taken too in
another way. How? As he says in another place, “If we die

dying now, and choose whilst living to die for His sake: so also
will he choose, when we are dead, to beget us then unto life. For
if we from life come into death, He also will from death lead us by
the hand into life.’</p>

just man uttered when he was in great dangers, and from which there
was no other possibility of recovery than by the aid of God.
Since then kindred circumstances are most effective in comforting,
therefore he says, “having the same Spirit;” that is, ‘by the
same succor by which he was saved, we also are saved; by the Spirit
through which he spake, we also speak.’ Whence he shows, that
between the New and Old Covenants great harmony exists, and that
the same Spirit wrought in either; and that not we alone are in
dangers, but all those of old were so too; and that we must find a
remedy<note place="end" n="629" id="v.ix-p23.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.ix-p24"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.ix-p24.1">διορθοῦσθαι</span>.</p></note> through

laid upon us. For having showed by arguments the resurrection and
the life, and that the danger was not a mark of helplessness or
destitution; he thenceforward brings in faith also, and to it
commits the whole. But still of this also, he furnishes a proof,
the resurrection, namely, of Christ, saying, “we also believe,
and therefore also we speak.” What do we believe? tell
me.</p>

therefore, was the resurrection and all the other things. For He
did not these things for the sake of one only, but of
all.</p>

but though our outward man is decaying, yet the inward man is

<p class="c19" id="v.ix-p30">How does it decay? Being scourged, being
persecuted, suffering ten thousand extremities. “Yet the inward
man is renewed day by day.” How is it renewed? By faith, by
hope, by a forward will, finally, by braving those extremities.
For in proportion as the body suffers ten thousand things, in the
like proportion hath the soul goodlier hopes and becometh brighter,
like gold refined in the fire more and more. And see how he
brings to nothing the sorrows of this present life.</p>

affliction,” he saith, “which is for the moment, worketh<note place="end" n="633" id="v.ix-p32.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.ix-p33"> <i>Worketh for us</i>, A.V., [the true text.]</p></note> more and
more exceedingly an eternal weight of glory; while we look not at
the things which are seen, but at the things which are not
seen.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.ix-p34">Having closed the question by a reference to hope,
(and, as he said in his Epistle to the Romans, “We are saved by
hope, but hope that is seen is not hope;” (<scripRef passage="Rom. viii. 24" id="v.ix-p34.1" parsed="|Rom|8|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.8.24">Rom. viii. 24</scripRef>.) establishing the same
point here also,) he sets side by side the things present with the
things to come, the momentary with the eternal, the light with the
weighty, the affliction with the glory. And neither is he content
with this, but he addeth another expression, doubling it and
saying, “more and more exceedingly<note place="end" n="634" id="v.ix-p34.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.ix-p35"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.ix-p35.1">καθ̓ ὓπερβολὴν εἰς
ὑπερβοήλν</span>.</p></note>.” Next he also shows the mode
how so great afflictions are light. How then light? “While we
look not at the things that are seen, but at the things that
<pb n="323" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_323.html" id="v.ix-Page_323" />are not seen.” So will both
this present be light and that future great, if we withdraw
ourselves from the things that are seen. “For the things that
are seen are temporal.” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. 4.18" id="v.ix-p35.2" parsed="|2Cor|4|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.4.18">v. 18</scripRef>.) Therefore the
afflictions are so too. “But the things that are not seen are
eternal.” Therefore the crowns are so also. And he said not
the afflictions are so, but “the things that are seen;” all of
them, whether punishment or rest, so that we should be neither
puffed up by the one nor overborne<note place="end" n="635" id="v.ix-p35.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.ix-p36"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.ix-p36.1">βιάζεσθαι</span>.</p></note> by the other. And therefore when
speaking of the things to come, he said not the kingdom is eternal;
but, “the things which are not seen are eternal,” whether they
be a kingdom, or again punishment; so as both to alarm by the one
and to encourage by the other.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.ix-p37">[3.] Since then “the things that are seen
are temporal, but the things that are not seen are eternal,” let
us look to them. For what excuse even can we have, if we choose
the temporal instead of the eternal? For even if the present be
pleasurable, yet it is not abiding; whilst the woe it entails is
abiding and irremissible. For what excuse will they have who have
been counted worthy of the Spirit and have enjoyed so great a gift,
if they become of grovelling mind and fall down to the earth. For
I hear many saying these words worthy of all scorn, ‘Give me
to-day and take tomorrow.’ ‘For,’ saith one, ‘if indeed
there be such things there as ye affirm, then it is one for one;
but if there be no such thing at all, then it is two for
nothing.’ What can be more lawless than these words? or what
more idle prating<note place="end" n="636" id="v.ix-p37.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.ix-p38"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.ix-p38.1">ληρωδέστερον</span>.</p></note>? We are

ashamed nor hidest thy face, whilst uttering such things as befit
maniacs? Blushest thou not that art so rivetted to the present
things? Wilt thou not cease from being distraught and beside
thyself, and in youth a dotard? Were Greeks indeed to talk in
this way, it were no marvel: but that believers should vent such
dotage, of what forgiveness doth it admit? For dost thou hold
those immortal hopes in utter suspicion? Dost thou think these
things to be utterly doubtful? And in what are these things
deserving of pardon? ‘And who hath come,’ saith one, ‘and
brought back word what is there?’ Of men indeed not any one,
but God, more trustworthy than all, hath declared these things.
But thou beholdest not what is there. Neither dost thou see
God. Wilt thou then deny that there is a God, because thou seest
Him not? ‘Yes,’ he replies, ‘I firmly believe there is a
God.’ If then an infidel should ask thee, ‘And who came from
Heaven and brought back word of this?’ what wilt thou answer? 
Whence dost thou know that there is a God? ‘From the things
that are seen,’ he answers, ‘from the fair order existing
through the whole creation, from its being manifest to all.’
Therefore receive also in the same way the doctrine of the
judgment. ‘How?’ he asks. I will question thee, and do thou
answer me. Is this God just, and will He render to each according
to his deserving? or, on the contrary, doth He will the wicked
should live happily and in luxury, and the good in the contrary
things? ‘By no means,’ he answers, ‘for man even would not
feel thus.’ Where then shall they who have done virtuously
here, enjoy the things that be good? and where the wicked the
opposites, except there is to be a life and retribution
hereafter? Seest thou that at present it is one for one, and not
two for one. But I will show thee, as I proceed, that it is not
even one against one, but it shall be for the righteous two for
nothing; and for the sinners and these that live here riotously,
quite the contrary. For they that have lived riotously here have
received not even one for one; but those who pass their life in
virtue two for nothing<note place="end" n="638" id="v.ix-p39.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.ix-p40"> “For one.” Bened., against most <span class="c18" id="v.ix-p40.1">mss</span>.</p></note>. For who are at in rest, they
that have abused this present life, or they that followed heavenly
wisdom? Perhaps thou wilt say the former, but I prove it of the
latter, summoning for my witnesses those very men that have enjoyed
these present things; and they will not be so shameless as to deny
what I am going to say. For oftentimes have they imprecated
curses upon matchmakers<note place="end" n="639" id="v.ix-p40.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.ix-p41"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.ix-p41.1">προμνηστοίαις</span>.</p></note> and upon the day that their bridal

wreathed, and have proclaimed them happy who have not married.
Many too of the young, even when they might have married, have
refused for no other reason than the troublesomeness of the
thing. And this I say, not as accusing marriage; for it is
“honorable;” (<scripRef passage="Heb. xiii. 4" id="v.ix-p42.2" parsed="|Heb|13|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Heb.13.4">Heb. xiii. 4</scripRef>.) but those who have used it
amiss. Now if they who have lived a married life, often
considered their life not worth the living; what shall we say of
those who have been swept down into whores’ deep pits, and are
more slavishly and wretchedly treated than any captive? what of
those who have grown rotten in luxury and have enveloped their
bodies with a thousand diseases? ‘But it is a pleasure to be
had in honor.’ Yea, rather, nothing is bitterer than this
slavery. For he that seeketh vain honor is more servile than any
slave, and desirous of pleasing any body; but he that treads it
under foot is superior to all, who careth 
<pb n="324" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_324.html" id="v.ix-Page_324" />not for the glory that cometh from
others. ‘But the possession of wealth is desirable.’ Yet we
have often shown that they who are loose from it and have nothing,
enjoy greater riches and repose. ‘But to be drunken is
pleasant.’ But who will say this? Surely then if to be
without riches is pleasanter than to have them, and not to marry
than to marry, and not to seek vainglory than to seek it, and not
to live luxuriously than to live so; even in this world they who
are not riveted to those present things have the advantage. And
as yet I say not how that the former, even though he be racked with
ten thousand tortures, hath that good hope to carry him through: 
whilst the latter, even though he is in the enjoyment of a thousand
delights, hath the fear of the future disquieting and confounding
his pleasure. For this, too, is no light sort of punishment; nor
therefore the contrary, of enjoyment and repose. And besides
these there is a third sort. And what is this? In that the
things of worldly delight do not even whilst they are present
appear such, being refuted<note place="end" n="641" id="v.ix-p42.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.ix-p43"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.ix-p43.1">ἐ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.ix-p43.2">λεγχὀμενα</span>.</p></note> both by nature and time; but the
others not only are, but also abide immovable. Seest thou that we
shall be able to put not two for nothing only, but three even, and
five, and ten, and twenty, and ten thousand for nothing? But that
thou mayest learn this same truth by an example also,—the rich
man and Lazarus,—the one enjoyed the things present, the other

teach thee also in another way that there is an awful tribunal
there? Open the doors of thy conscience, and behold the judge
that sitteth in thine heart. Now if thou condemnest thyself,
although a lover of thyself, and canst not refrain from passing a
righteous verdict, will not God much rather make great provision
for that which is just, and pass that impartial judgment upon all;
or will He permit everything to go on loosely and at random? And
who will say this? No one; but both Greeks and barbarians, both
poets and philosophers, yea the whole race of men in this agree

<p class="c19" id="v.ix-p47">[4.] ‘And wherefore,’ saith one, ‘doth he
not punish here?’ That He may display that longsuffering of
His, and may offer to us the salvation that cometh by repentance,
and not make our race to be swept away, nor pluck away those who by
an excellent change are able to be saved, before that salvation.
For if he instantly punished upon the commission of sins, and
destroyed, how should Paul have been saved, how should Peter, the
chief teachers of the world? How should David have reaped the
salvation that came by his repentance? How the Galatians? How
many others? For this reason then He neither exacts the penalty
from all here, (but only from some out of all,) nor yet there from
all, but from one here, and from another there; that He may both
rouse those who are exceedingly insensible by means of those whom
He punishes, and may cause them to expect the future things by

rich man in the story of Lazarus; as many others. (<scripRef passage="Luke xvi" id="v.ix-p47.3" parsed="|Luke|16|0|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.16">Luke xvi</scripRef>.) Now these things He
does, both to arouse those who quite disbelieve<note place="end" n="645" id="v.ix-p47.4"><p class="endnote" id="v.ix-p48"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.ix-p48.1">διαπιστοῦντας</span>.</p></note> in the things to come, and to make
those who do believe and are careless more diligent. “For God
is a righteous Judge, and strong, and longsuffering, and visits not
with wrath every day.” (<scripRef passage="Ps. vii. 11" id="v.ix-p48.2" parsed="|Ps|7|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.7.11">Ps. vii. 11</scripRef>. LXX.) But if we abuse His
longsuffering, there will come a time when He will no more be
longsuffering even for a little, but will straightway inflict the
penalty.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.ix-p49">Let us not then, in order that for a single moment
(for such is this present life) we may live luxuriously, draw on
ourselves punishment through endless ages: but let us toil for a
moment, that we may be crowned for ever. See ye not that even in
worldly things most men act in this manner; and choose a brief toil
in order to <pb n="325" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_325.html" id="v.ix-Page_325" />a long rest,
even though the opposite falls out unto them? For in this life
indeed there is an equal portion of toils and reward; yea, often,
on the contrary, the toil is endless whilst the fruit is little, or
not even a little; but in the case of the kingdom conversely, the
labor is little whilst the pleasure is great and boundless. For
consider: the husbandman wearieth himself the whole year through,
and at the very end of his hope of times misses of the fruit<note place="end" n="646" id="v.ix-p49.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.ix-p50"> Or, “at the very end ofttimes misses of his hope,
the fruit, &amp;c.”</p></note> of those
many toils. The shipmaster again and the soldier, until extreme
old age, are occupied with wars and labors; and oftentimes hath
each of them departed, the one with the loss of his wealthy
cargoes, the other, along with victory, of life itself. What
excuse then shall we have, tell me, if in worldly matters indeed we
prefer what is laborious in order that we may rest for a little, or
not a little even; (for the hope of this is uncertain;) but in
spiritual things do the converse of this and draw upon ourselves
unutterable punishment for a little sloth? Wherefore I beseech
you all, though late, yet still at length to recover from this
frenzy. For none shall deliver us in that day; neither brother,
nor father, nor child, nor friend, nor neighbor, nor any other: 
but if our works play us false, all will be over and we must
needs<note place="end" n="647" id="v.ix-p50.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.ix-p51"> Or, ‘utterly.’</p></note> perish.

varies from the text in other respects. [Not, however, so as to
affect the sense of the passage. Perhaps in quoting he took only
that portion which suited his purpose. The word he uses for <i>

sense. C.]</p></note> betwixt us and you, so that they

those virgins make to their fellows for a little oil!  But hear
what they also say; “Peradventure there will not be enough for

able to bring them in to the bridal chamber.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.ix-p53">Thinking then on these things let us also be
careful of that which is our life. For mention what toils soever

beasts, and if there be aught sorer than these; but yet these are

we may behold Him gentle and serene, that we may escape altogether
those threat-bearing Powers. Seest thou not how this world’s
soldiers who perform the bidding of those in authority drag men
about; how they chain, how they scourge them, how they pierce their
sides, how they apply torches to their torments, how they dismember
them? Yet all these things are but plays and joke unto those
punishments. For these punishments are temporal; but there
neither the worm dieth nor is the fire quenched: for that body of
all is incorruptible, which is then to be raised up. But God
grant that we may never learn these things by experience; but that
these fearful things may never be nearer unto us than in the
mention of them<note place="end" n="650" id="v.ix-p54.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.ix-p55"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.ix-p55.1">μεχρὶ ῥηματος

lamentations shall we utter!  How many groans!  But it will
thenceforth be of no avail. For neither can sailors, when the
ship hath gone to pieces and hath sunk, thereafter be of any
service; nor physicians when the patient is departed; but they will
often say indeed that so and so ought to have been done; but all is
fruitless and in vain. For as long indeed as hopes remain from
amendment, one ought both to say and do every thing: but when we
have no longer any thing in our power, all being quite ruined, it
is to no purpose that all is said and done. For even then Jews
will then say, “Blessed is He that cometh in the Name of the
Lord:”  (<scripRef passage="Matt. xxiii. 39" id="v.ix-p56.5" parsed="|Matt|23|39|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.23.39">Matt.

be able to reap none advantage of this cry towards escaping their
punishment; for when they ought to have said it, they said it
not. That then this be not the case with us in respect to our
life, let us now and from this time reform that we may stand at the
tribunal of Christ with all boldness; whereunto may all of us
attain through the grace and love toward men of our Lord Jesus
Christ, with Whom to the Father, with the Holy Spirit, be glory and
might for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

consequence of his absence, were weaker in respect to this
[need]. What then saith he? One ought not to wonder that we
suffer affliction; nor to be confounded, for we even reap many
gains thereby. And some of these he mentioned before; for
instance, that we “bear about the dying of Jesus,” and present
the greatest proof of His power: for he says, “that the
exceeding greatness of the power may be of God:” and we exhibit
a clear proof of the Resurrection, for, says he, “that the life
of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh.” But since
along with these things he said that our inward man is thus made
better also; for “though our outward man is decaying,” saith
he, “yet the inward man is renewed day by day;” showing again
that this being scourged and persecuted is proportionately useful,
he adds, that when this is done thoroughly, then the countless good
things will spring up for those who have endured these things.
For lest when thou hearest that thy outward man perishes, thou
shouldest grieve; he says, that when this is completely effected,
then most of all shalt thou rejoice and shalt come unto a better
inheritance<note place="end" n="653" id="v.x-p5.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.x-p6"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.x-p6.1">λῆξιν</span>.</p></note>. So that
not only ought not one to grieve at its perishing now in part, but
even earnestly to seek for the completion of that destruction, for
this most conducts thee to immortality. Wherefore also he added,
“For we know, that if the earthly house of our tabernacle be
dissolved: we have a building from God, a house not made with
hands, eternal in the heavens.” For since he is urging<note place="end" n="654" id="v.x-p6.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.x-p7"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.x-p7.1">γυμνάζει</span>.</p></note> again the
doctrine of the Resurrection in respect to which they were
particularly unsound; he calls in aid the judgment of his hearers
also, and so establishes it; not however in the same way as before,
but, as it were, arriving at it out of another subject: (for they
had been already corrected:)  and says, “We know that if the
earthly house of our tabernacle be dissolved, we have a building
from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.”
Some indeed say that the ‘earthly house’ is this world; But I
should maintain that he alludes rather to the body.<note place="end" n="655" id="v.x-p7.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.x-p8"> [In this view that the building from God is the
resurrection body, Chrysostom has the support of nearly all the
recent expositors—Hodge indeed contends stoutly and ably that the
house not made with hands is heaven itself, yet not with success.
For if the earthly house is a body, the heavenly house must be one
also, else the comparison fails much in force and point; moreover,
a body which is said to be now in heaven and afterwards to come
from heaven can hardly be identical with heaven. C.]</p></note>  But
observe, I pray, how by the terms [he uses,] he shows the
superiority of the future things to the present. For having said
“earthly” he hath opposed to it “the heavenly;” having
said, “house of tabernacle,” thereby declaring both that it is
easily taken to pieces and is temporary, he hath opposed to it the
“eternal,” for the name “tabernacle” often times denotes
temporariness. Wherefore He saith, “In My Father’s house are
many abiding places.” (<scripRef passage="John xiv. 2" id="v.x-p8.1" parsed="|John|14|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.14.2">John xiv. 2</scripRef>.) But if He anywhere also
calls the resting places of the saints tabernacles; He calls them
not tabernacles simply, but adds an epithet; for he said not, that
“they may receive you” into their tabernacles, but “into the
eternal tabernacles.” (<scripRef passage="Luke xvi. 9" id="v.x-p8.2" parsed="|Luke|16|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.16.9">Luke xvi. 9</scripRef>.) Moreover also in
that he said, “not made with hands,” he alluded to that which
was made with hands. What then? Is the body made with hands? 
By no means; but he either alludes to the houses here that are made
with hands, or if not this, then he called the body which is not
made with hands, ’a house of tabernacle.’ For he has not used
the term in antithesis and contradistinction<note place="end" n="656" id="v.x-p8.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.x-p9"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.x-p9.1">πρὸς ἀντιδιαστολήν

groan, longing to be clothed upon with our habitation which is from
heaven.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.x-p11">What habitation? tell me. The incorruptible
body. And why do we groan now? Because that is far better.
And “from heaven” he calls it because of its
incorruptibleness. For it is not surely that a body will come
down to us from above: but by this expression he <pb n="327" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_327.html" id="v.x-Page_327" />signifies the grace which is
sent from thence. So far then ought we to be from grieving at
these trials which are in part that we ought to seek even for their
fulness<note place="end" n="657" id="v.x-p11.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.x-p12"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.x-p12.1">το καθολικὸν</span>.</p></note>, as if he
had said: Groanest thou, that thou art persecuted, that this thy
man is decaying? Groan that this is not done unto excess and that
it perishes not entirely. Seest thou how he hath turned round
what was said unto the contrary; having proved that they ought to
groan that those things were not done fully; for which because they
were done partially; they groaned. Therefore he henceforth calls
it not a tabernacle, but a house, and with great reason. For a
tabernacle indeed is easily taken to pieces; but a house abideth
continually.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.x-p13"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 5.3" id="v.x-p13.1" parsed="|2Cor|5|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.5.3">Ver. 3</scripRef>. “If so be that

<p class="c19" id="v.x-p15">That is, even if we have put off the body, we shall
not be presented there without a body, but even with the same one
made incorruptible. But some read, and it deserves very much to
be adopted, “If so be that being clothed we shall not be found
naked.” For lest all should be confident because of the
Resurrection, he says, “If so be that being clothed,” that is,
having obtained incorruption and an incorruptible body, “we shall
not be found naked” of glory and safety. As he also said in the
former Epistle; “We shall all be raised; but each in his own
order.” And, “There are celestial bodies, and bodies
terrestial.” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. 15.22,23,40" id="v.x-p15.1" parsed="|1Cor|15|22|15|23;|1Cor|15|40|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.15.22-1Cor.15.23 Bible:1Cor.15.40">1 Cor. xv. 22, 23.) (ib. 40</scripRef>.) For the Resurrection
indeed is common to all, but the glory is not common; but some
shall rise in honor and others in dishonor, and some to a kingdom
but others to punishment. This surely he signified here also,
when he said; “If so be that being clothed we shall not be found
naked.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.x-p16">[3.] <scripRef passage="2 Cor. 5.4" id="v.x-p16.1" parsed="|2Cor|5|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.5.4">Ver. 4</scripRef>. “For indeed we that
are in this tabernacle do groan<note place="end" n="659" id="v.x-p16.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.x-p17"> “Being burdened,” Rec. text, which St.
Chrysostom omits.</p></note>, not for that we would be
unclothed, but that we would be clothed upon.” Here again he
hath utterly and manifestly stopped the mouths of the heretics,
showing that he is not speaking absolutely of a body differing in
identity<note place="end" n="660" id="v.x-p17.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.x-p18"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.x-p18.1">ἅλλου

corruption and incorruption: ‘For we do not therefore groan,’
saith he, ‘that we may be delivered from the body: for of this
we do not wish to be unclothed; but we hasten to be delivered from
the corruption that is in it.’ Wherefore he saith, ‘we wish
not to be unclothed of the body, but that it should be clothed upon
with incorruption.’ Then he also interprets it [thus,] “That
what is mortal may be swallowed up of life.” For since putting
off the body appeared to many a grievous thing; and he was
contradicting the judgments of all, when he said, “we groan,”
not wishing to be set free from it; (‘for if,’ says one, ‘the
soul in being separated from it so suffers and laments, how sayest
thou that we groan because we are not separated from it?’) lest
then this should be urged against him, he says, ‘Neither do I
assert that we therefore groan, that we may put it off; (for no one
putteth it off without pain, seeing that Christ says even of Peter,
‘They shall “carry thee,” and lead thee “whither thou
wouldest not;”—<scripRef passage="John xxi. 18" id="v.x-p18.2" parsed="|John|21|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.21.18">John xxi. 18</scripRef>.) but that we may have
it clothed upon with incorruption.’ For it is in this respect
that we are burdened by the body; not because it is a body, but
because we are encompassed with a corruptible body and liable to
suffering<note place="end" n="661" id="v.x-p18.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.x-p19"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.x-p19.1">παθητὸν</span>.</p></note>, for it is
this that also causes us pain. But the life when it arriveth
destroyeth and useth up the corruption; the corruption, I say, not
the body. ‘And how cometh this to pass?’ saith one. Inquire
not; God doeth it; be not too curious. Wherefore also he
added,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.x-p21">Hereby he shows that these things were prefigured
from the first. For not now was this decreed: but when at the

the proof of it, he added,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.x-p22">“Who also gave the earnest of the

hath wrought unto this by baptism, and hath furnished us with no

thereby also to make what he says more credible unto the grosser
sort.<note place="end" n="663" id="v.x-p23.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.x-p24"> [The argument of these verses is thus
presented by Beet, <i>in lo</i>. “By Christians now death is
looked upon without terrible recoil, as being the only entrance
into Life. We bow to the inevitable. But in the early
Christians the possibility of surviving the coming of Christ woke
up with new intensity man’s natural love of life, and made death
seem very dark.  They therefore longed eagerly for Christ’s
return, hoping thus to clothe themselves with immortal raiment
without laying aside their mortal bodies. This yearning for an
immortal body, Paul felt to be divinely implanted, and therefore
not doomed to disappointment. But the possibility of death was to
Paul too real to be ignored. Therefore, in view of it, his
yearning for an immortal body assured him that if his present body
be removed by death a heavenly body awaits him. For otherwise, he
will stand before Christ as a naked spirit, in utter contradiction
to yearnings which he felt to be divine and of whose realization he
had a divine pledge. In other words his instinctive clinging to
his present body was to him a divine intimation that when Christ
comes we shall not be naked spirits, but spirits clothed in bodies;
and was therefore a proof that if our present body be removed by
death a heavenly and eternal body awaits us. Thus a purely human
instinct, not weakened but intensified by Christianity, and
sanctified by the felt presence of the Holy Spirit, is seen to be a
prophecy of God’s purpose concerning us. Similar argument

good courage” is used with reference to the persecutions, the
plottings, and the continual deaths: as if he had said, ‘Doth
any vex and persecute and slay thee? Be not cast down, for thy
good all is done. Be not afraid: but of good courage. For
that which thou groanest and grievest for, that thou art in bondage
to corruption, he removes from henceforward out of the way, and
frees thee the sooner from this bondage.’ Wherefore also he
saith, “Being therefore always of good courage,” not in the
seasons of rest only, but also in those of tribulation; “and
knowing,”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.x-p28">That which is greater than all he has put
last, for to be with Christ is better, than receiving an
incorruptible [body.] But what he means is this: ‘He
quencheth not our life that warreth against and killeth us; be not
afraid; be of good courage even when hewn in pieces. For not only
doth he set thee free from corruption and a burden, but he also
sendeth thee quickly to the Lord.’ Wherefore neither did he
say, “whilst we ‘are’ in the body:” as of those who are
in a foreign and strange land. “Knowing therefore that whilst
we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord: we are
of good courage, I say, and willing to be absent from the body, and

and passing over those things which are accounted to be sweet, the

the life here an absence from the Lord? Now this he did, both
that no one might fondly linger amongst present things, but rather
be aweary of them; and that none when about to die might be
disquieted<note place="end" n="665" id="v.x-p29.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.x-p30"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.x-p30.1">ἀ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.x-p30.2">λύῃ</span>.</p></note>, but might
even rejoice as departing unto greater goods. Then that none
might say on hearing that we are absent from the Lord, ‘Why
speakest thou thus? Are we then estranged from Him whilst we are
here?’ he in anticipation corrected<note place="end" n="666" id="v.x-p30.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.x-p31"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.x-p31.1">προδιώρθωσε</span>.</p></note> such a thought, saying, “For we
walk by faith, not by sight.” Even here indeed we know Him, but
not so clearly. As he says also elsewhere, (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. xiii. 12" id="v.x-p31.2" parsed="|1Cor|13|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.13.12">1 Cor. xiii. 12</scripRef>.) “in a mirror,” and
“darkly.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.x-p32">“We are of good courage, I say, and willing.”
Wonderful! to what hath he brought round the discourse? To an
extreme desire of death, having shown the grievous to be
pleasurable, and the pleasurable grievous. For by the term, “we
are willing” he means, ‘we are desirous.’ Of what are we
desirous? Of being “absent from the body, and at home with the
Lord.” And thus he does perpetually, (as I showed also before)
turning round the objection of his opponents unto the very
contrary.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.x-p33"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 5.9" id="v.x-p33.1" parsed="|2Cor|5|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.5.9">Ver. 9</scripRef>.
“Wherefore also we make it our aim whether at home or absent, to
be well pleasing unto him.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.x-p34">‘For what we seek for is this,’ saith he,
‘whether we be there or here, to live according to His will; for
this is the principal thing. So that by this thou hast the
kingdom already in possession without a probation.’ For lest
when they had arrived at so great a desire of being there, they
should again be disquieted at its being so long first, in this he
gives them already the chief<note place="end" n="667" id="v.x-p34.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.x-p35"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.x-p35.1">τὸ κεφὰλαιον</span>.</p></note> of those good things. And what is
this? To be well “pleasing.” For as to depart is not
absolutely good, but to do so in [God’s] favor, which is what
makes departing also become a good; so to remain here is not
absolutely grievous, but to remain offending Him. Deem not then
that departure from the body is enough; for virtue is always
necessary. For as when he spoke of a Resurrection, he allowed
[them] not by it alone to be of good courage, saying, “If so be
that being clothed we shall not be found naked;” so also having
showed a departure, lest thou shouldest think that this is enough
to save thee, he added that it is needful that we be well
pleasing.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.x-p36">[5.] Seeing then he has persuaded them by
many good things, henceforth he alarms them also by those of
gloomier aspect<note place="end" n="668" id="v.x-p36.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.x-p37"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.x-p37.1">σκυθρωποτέρων</span>.</p></note>. For our
interest consists both in the attainment of the good things and the
avoidance of the evil things, in other words, hell and the
kingdom. But since this, the avoiding of punishment, is the more
forcible motive; for where penalty reaches only to the not
receiving good things, the most will bear this contentedly; but if
it also extend to the suffering of evil, do so no longer: (for
they ought, indeed, to consider the former intolerable, but from
the weakness and grovelling nature of the many, the latter appears
to them more hard to bear:)  since then (I say) the giving of the
good things doth not so arouse the general hearer as the threat of
the punishments, he is obliged to conclude with this,
saying,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.x-p38"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 5.10" id="v.x-p38.1" parsed="|2Cor|5|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.5.10">Ver. 10</scripRef>. “For we must all be made
manifest before the judgment-seat.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.x-p39">Then having alarmed and shaken<note place="end" n="669" id="v.x-p39.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.x-p40"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.x-p40.1">κατασείσας</span>.</p></note> the hearer
by the mention of that judgment-seat, he hath <pb n="329" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_329.html" id="v.x-Page_329" />not even here set down the woful
without the good things, but hath mingled something of pleasure,
saying,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.x-p41">“That each one may receive the things done
in the body,” as many<note place="end" n="670" id="v.x-p41.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.x-p42"> So Chrysostom here, but below with the Received
text, “according to that,” &amp;c.</p></note> as “he hath done, whether” it
be “good or bad.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.x-p43">By saying these words, he both reviveth<note place="end" n="671" id="v.x-p43.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.x-p44"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.x-p44.1">ἀ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.x-p44.2">νιστᾷ</span>.</p></note> those who
have done virtuously and are persecuted with those hopes, and
maketh those who have fallen back more earnest by that fear. And
he thus confirmed his words touching the resurrection of the
body. ‘For surely,’ sayeth he, ‘that which hath ministered
to the one and to the other shall not stand excluded from the
recompenses: but along with the soul shall in the one case be
punished, in the other crowned.’ But some of the heretics say,
that it is another body that is raised. How so? tell me. Did
one sin, and is another punished? Did one do virtuously, and is
another crowned? And what will ye answer to Paul, saying, “We
would not be unclothed, but clothed upon?” And how is that
which is mortal “swallowed up of life?” For he said not, that
the mortal or corruptible body should be swallowed up of the
incorruptible body; but that corruption [should be swallowed up]
“of life.” For then this happeneth when the same body is
raised; but if, giving up that body, He should prepare another, no
longer is corruption swallowed up but continueth dominant.
Therefore this is not so; but “this corruptible,” that is to
say the body, “must put on incorruption.” For the body is in
a middle state<note place="end" n="672" id="v.x-p44.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.x-p45"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.x-p45.1">μέσον</span>.</p></note>, being at
present in this and hereafter to be in that; and for this reason in
this first, because it is impossible for the incorruption to be
dissolved. “For neither doth corruption inherit
incorruption,” saith he, (for, how is it [then] incorruption?)
but on the contrary, “corruption is swallowed up of life:”
for this indeed survives the other, but not the other this. For
as wax is melted by fire but itself doth not melt the fire: so
also doth corruption melt and vanish away under incorruption, but
is never able itself to get the better of incorruption.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.x-p46">[6.] Let us then hear the voice of Paul,
saying, that “we must stand at the judgment-seat of Christ;”
and let us picture to ourselves that court of justice, and imagine
it to be present now and the reckoning to be required<note place="end" n="673" id="v.x-p46.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.x-p47"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.x-p47.1">εὐθύνας
ἀπαιτεῖσθαι</span>.</p></note>. For I
will speak of it more at large. For Paul, seeing that he was
discoursing on affliction, and he had no mind to afflict them
again, did not dwell on the subject; but having in brief expressed
its austerity<note place="end" n="674" id="v.x-p47.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.x-p48"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.x-p48.1">τὸ στῦφον</span>.</p></note>, “Each one
shall receive according to what he hath done,” he quickly passed
on. Let us then imagine it to be present now, and reckon each one
of us with his own conscience, and account the Judge to be already
present, and everything to be revealed and brought forth. For we
must not merely stand, but also be manifested. Do ye not blush? 
Are ye not astonied? But if now, when the reality is not yet
present, but is granted in supposition merely and imaged in
thought; if now [I say] we perish conscience-struck; what shall we
do when [it] shall arrive, when the whole world shall be present,
when angels and archangels, when ranks upon ranks, and all hurrying
at once, and some caught up<note place="end" n="675" id="v.x-p48.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.x-p49"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.x-p49.1">ἁ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.x-p49.2">ρπαγαι</span>.</p></note> on the clouds, and an array full of
trembling; when there shall be the trumpets, one upon another,
[when] those unceasing voices?</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.x-p50">For suppose there were no hell, yet in the
midst of so great brightness to be rejected and to go away
dishonored;—how great the punishment!  For if even now, when the
Emperor rideth in and his train with him, we contemplating each one
of us our own poverty, derive not so much pleasure from the
spectacle, as we endure dejection at having no share in what is
going on about the Emperor, nor being near the Sovereign; what will
it be then? Or thinkest thou it is a light punishment, not to be
ranked in that company, not to be counted worthy of that
unutterable glory, from that assemblage and those untold good
things, to be cast forth some-wither far and distant? But when
there is also darkness, and gnashing of teeth, and chains
indissoluble, and an undying worm, and fire unquenchable, and
affliction, and straitness, and tongues scorching like the rich
man’s; and we wail, and none heareth; and we groan and gnash our
teeth for anguish, and none regardeth; and we look all round, and
no where is there any to comfort us; where shall we rank those that
are in this condition? what is there more miserable than are those
souls? what more pitiable? For if, when we enter a prison and see
its inmates, some squalid, some chained and famishing, some again
shut up in darkness, we are moved with compassion, we shudder, we
use all diligence that we may never be cast into that place; how
will it be with us, when we are led and dragged away into the
torture-dungeons<note place="end" n="676" id="v.x-p50.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.x-p51"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.x-p51.1">βασανιστηρία</span>.</p></note> themselves
of hell? For not of iron are those chains, but of fire that is
never quenched; nor are they that are set over us our fellows whom
it is often possible even to mollify; but angels whom one may not
so much as look in the face, exceedingly enraged at our insults to
their Master. Nor is it given, as here, to see some bringing in
money, some food, some words of comfort, and to meet with
consolation; but all is irremissible there: and though it should
be Noah, <pb n="330" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_330.html" id="v.x-Page_330" />or Job,
or Daniel, and he should see his own kindred punished, he dares not
succor. For even natural sympathy too comes then to be done
away. For since it happeneth that there are righteous fathers of
wicked children, and [righteous] children of [wicked] fathers; that
so their pleasure may be unalloyed, and those who enjoy the good
things may not be moved with sorrow through the constraining force
of sympathy, even this sympathy, I affirm, is extinguished, and
themselves are indignant together with the Master against their own
bowels. For if the common run of men, when they see their own
children vicious, disown<note place="end" n="677" id="v.x-p51.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.x-p52"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.x-p52.1">αποκηρύττουσιν</span>.</p></note> and cut them off from that
relationship; much rather will the righteous then. Therefore let
no one hope for good things, if he have not wrought any good thing,
even though he have ten thousand righteous ancestors. “For each
one shall receive the things done in the body according to what he
hath done.” Here he seems to me to be alluding also to them
that commit fornication: and to raise up as a wall<note place="end" n="678" id="v.x-p52.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.x-p53"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.x-p53.1">ἐ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.x-p53.2">πιτειχίζων</span>.</p></note> unto them
the fear of that world, not however to them alone; but also to all
that in any wise transgress.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.x-p54">[7.] Let us hear then, us also. And if
thou have the fire of lust, set against it that other fire, and
this will presently be quenched and gone. And if thou purposest
to utter some harsh sounding<note place="end" n="679" id="v.x-p54.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.x-p55"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.x-p55.1">ἀ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.x-p55.2">πηχὲς</span>.</p></note> [speech], think of the gnashing of
teeth, and the fear will be a bridle to thee. And if thou
purposest to plunder, hear the Judge commanding, and saying,
“Bind him hand and foot, and cast him into the outer darkness,”

13</scripRef>.) and thou wilt cast
out this lust also. And if thou art drunken, and surfeitest
continually, hear the rich man saying, ‘Send Lazarus, that with
the tip of his finger he may cool this scorching tongue;’ (<scripRef passage="Luke xvi. 24" id="v.x-p55.4" parsed="|Luke|16|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.16.24">Luke xvi. 24</scripRef>.) yet not obtaining
this; and thou wilt hold thyself aloof from that distemper<note place="end" n="680" id="v.x-p55.5"><p class="endnote" id="v.x-p56"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.x-p56.1">πάθους</span>.</p></note>. But if
thou lovest luxury, think of the affliction and the straitness
there, and thou wilt not think at all of this. If again thou art
harsh and cruel, bethink thee of those virgins who when their lamps
had gone out missed so of the bridal chamber, and thou wilt quickly
become humane. Or sluggish art thou, and remiss? Consider him
that hid the talent, and thou wilt be more vehement than fire. Or
doth desire of thy neighbor’s substance devour thee? Think of
the worm that dieth not, and thou wilt easily both put away from
thee this disease, and in all other things wilt do virtuously.
For He hath enjoined nothing irksome or oppressive. Whence then
do His injunctions appear irksome to us? From our own
slothfulness. For as if we labor diligently, even what appears
intolerable will be light and easy; so if we are slothful, even
things tolerable will seem to us difficult.<note place="end" n="681" id="v.x-p56.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.x-p57"> [Chrysostom appears distinctly to accept the
common faith of the church that the things done in the body
(literally, “through the body,” as the channel by which
purposes pass into actions) furnish the basis upon which the last
assize proceeds. He makes no reference to any <i>post mortem</i>
probation, but (on pages 331, 332) asserts the contrary, “Here
the opportunities of salvation exist, but there are found no
longer.” Nor is his view of the retributions of the judgment
inconsistent with his repeated assertions of salvation as wholly
gratuitous. Entrance into eternal life is God’s free gift to
all who believe. But the degree of glory will be measured by the
faithfulness of service, just as the degree of the punishment of
the lost will be by the number and aggravation of their sins.
Hence it follows that although the salvation of any is due to
God’s undeserved favor, still each one that stands at the bar
will receive an exact recompense for his entire conduct in the days
of his flesh. “A remembrance of this exact recompense,” it
has well been said, “will make us comparatively indifferent about
life or death, and emulous so to act as to please our Judge.”

<p class="c19" id="v.x-p58">Considering then all these things, let us think not
of the luxurious, but what is their end; here indeed filth and
obesity, there the worm and fire: not of the rapacious, but what
is their end; cares here, and fears, and anxieties; there chains
indissoluble: not of the lovers of glory, but what these things
bring forth; here slavery and dissemblings, and there both loss
intolerable and perpetual burnings. For if we thus discourse with
ourselves, and if with these and such like things we charm
perpetually our evil lusts, quickly shall we both cast out the love
of the present things, and kindle that of the things to come. Let
us therefore kindle it and make it blaze. For if the conception
of them, although a faint sort of one, affords so great pleasure;
think how great the gladness, the manifest experience itself shall
bring us. Blessed, and thrice blessed, yea, thrice blessed many
times, are they who enjoy those good things; just as, consequently,
pitiable and thrice wretched are they Who endure the opposite of
these. That then we may be not of these but those, let us choose
virtue. For so shall we attain unto the good things to come as
well; which may all we attain, through the grace and love towards
men of our Lord Jesus Christ; by Whom, and with Whom, to the
Father, together with the Holy Spirit, be glory, might, and honor,
now and for ever, and world without end. Amen.</p>

suspicion of appearing to praise himself. For nothing is so
offensive to the hearers as for any one to say great and marvellous
things about himself. Since then he was compelled in what he said
to fall upon that subject, he uses a corrective, saying, ‘we do
this for your sakes, not for ours, that ye may have somewhat to
glory of, not that we may.’ And not even this absolutely, but
because of the false Apostles. Wherefore also he added, “To
answer them that glory in appearance, and not in heart.” Seest
thou how he hath detached them from them, and drawn them to
himself; having shown that even the Corinthians themselves are
longing to get hold of some occasion, whereby they may have it in
their power to speak on their<note place="end" n="682" id="v.xi-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xi-p7"> The Apostles’.</p></note> behalf and to defend them unto
their accusers. For, says he, ‘we say these things not that we
may boast, but that ye may have wherein to speak freely on our
behalf;’ which is the language of one testifying to their great
love: ‘and not that ye may boast merely: but that ye may not
be drawn aside.’ But this he does not say explicitly, but
manages his words otherwise and in a gentler form, and without
dealing them a blow, saying,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xi-p8">“That ye may have somewhat to glory towards
those which glory in appearance.” But neither this does he bid
them do absolutely, when no cause exists, but when they<note place="end" n="683" id="v.xi-p8.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xi-p9"> The false Apostles.</p></note> extol
themselves; for in all things he looks out for the fitting
occasion. He does not then do this in order to show himself to be
illustrious, but to stop those men who were using the thing<note place="end" n="684" id="v.xi-p9.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xi-p10"> i.e., self commendation.</p></note> improperly
and to the injury of these. But what is “in appearance?” In
what is seen, in what is for display. For of such sort were they,
doing every thing out of a love of honor, whilst they were both
empty inwardly and wore indeed an appearance of piety and of
venerable seeming, but of good works were destitute.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xi-p21">If therefore we ought not to live unto ourselves,
‘be not troubled,’ says he, ‘nor be confounded when dangers
and deaths assail you.’ And he assigns besides an indubitable
argument by which he shows that the thing is a debt. For if
through Him we live who were dead; to Him we ought to live through
Whom we live. And what is said appears indeed to be one thing,
but if any one accurately examine it, it is two: one that we live
by Him, another that He died for us: either of which even by
itself is enough to make us liable; but when even both are united
consider how great the debt is. Yea, rather, there are three
things here. For the First-fruits also for thy sake He raised up,
and led up to heaven: wherefore also he added, “Who for our
sakes died and rose again.”</p>

know no man after the flesh.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xi-p23">For if all died and all rose again; and in such sort
died as the tyranny of sin condemned them; but rose again
“through the laver of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy

reason, “we know none” of the faithful “after the flesh.”

destroyed, and we are born again<note place="end" n="689" id="v.xi-p23.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xi-p24"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xi-p24.1">ἄ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.xi-p24.2">νωθεν</span>.</p></note> by the Spirit, and have learnt

namely, in the heavens. And again of this itself he shows Christ
to be the Author. Wherefore also he added,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xi-p26">“Even though we have known Christ after the flesh,
yet now we know Him so no more.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xi-p27">What then? tell me. Did He put away the flesh, and
is He now not with that body? Away with the thought, for He is
even now clothed in flesh; for “this Jesus Who is taken up from
you into Heaven shall so come. So? How? In flesh, with His
body. How then doth he say, “Even though we have known Christ
after the flesh, yet now henceforth no more?” (<scripRef passage="Acts i. 11" id="v.xi-p27.1" parsed="|Acts|1|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.1.11">Acts i. 11</scripRef>.) For in us indeed “after
the flesh” is being in sins, and “not after the flesh” not
being in sins; but in Christ, “after the flesh” is His being
subject to the affections of nature, such as to thirst, to hunger,
to weariness, to sleep. For “He did no sin, neither was guile
found in His mouth.” (<scripRef passage="1 Pet. ii. 22" id="v.xi-p27.2" parsed="|1Pet|2|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Pet.2.22">1 Pet. ii. 22</scripRef>.) Wherefore He also said,
“Which of you convicteth Me of sin?” (<scripRef passage="John viii. 46" id="v.xi-p27.3" parsed="|John|8|46|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.8.46">John viii. 46</scripRef>.) and again, “The prince of

the flesh” is being thenceforward freed even from these things,
not the being without flesh. For with this also He cometh to
judge the world, His being impassible and pure. Whereunto we also
shall advance when “our body” hath been “fashioned like unto
His glorious body.” (<scripRef passage="Philip. iii. 21" id="v.xi-p27.5" parsed="|Phil|3|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Phil.3.21">Philip. iii. 21</scripRef>.)</p>

in Christ, he is a new creature.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xi-p29">For seeing he had exhorted unto virtue from
His love, he now leads them on to this from what has been actually
done for them; wherefore also he added, “If any man is in
Christ,” he is “a new creature.” “If any,” saith he,
“have believed in Him, he has come to another creation, for he
hath been born again by the Spirit.” So that for this cause
also, he says, we ought to live unto Him, not because we are not
our own only, nor because He died for us only, nor because He
raised up our First-fruits only, but because we have also come unto
another life. See how many just grounds he urges for a life of
virtue. For on this account he also calls the reformation by a
grosser name<note place="end" n="691" id="v.xi-p29.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xi-p30"> i.e. creation.</p></note>, in order to
show the transition and the change to be great. Then following
out farther what he had said, and showing how it is “a new
creation,” he adds, “The old things are passed away, behold,
all things are<note place="end" n="692" id="v.xi-p30.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xi-p31"> [“They are” Rev. Ver., in accordance with the
best authorities. C.]</p></note> become
new.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xi-p32">What old things? He means either sins and
impieties, or else all the Judaical observances. Yea rather, he
means both the one and the other. “Behold, all things are
become new.”</p>

God.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xi-p34">Nothing of ourselves. For remission of sins and
adoption and unspeakable glory are given to us by Him. For he
exhorts them no longer from the things to come only, but even from
those now present. For consider. He said, that we shall be
raised again, and go on unto incorruption, and have an eternal
house; but since present things have more force to persuade than
things to come, with those who believe not in these as they ought
to believe, he shows how great things they have even already
received, and being themselves what. What then being, received
they them? Dead all; (for he saith, “all died;” and, “He

He all alike;) inveterate all, and grown old in their vices. But

delivered out of Egypt, but we must also enter into the

Lamb. With these and such like things in his thought he said,
“all things are new.” But “all” these “things are of
God,” by Christ, and His free gift. Wherefore also he
added,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xi-p38">“Who reconciled us to Himself through Christ, and
gave unto us the ministry of reconciliation.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xi-p39">For from Him are all the good things. For He that
made us friends is Himself also the cause of the other things which
God hath given to His friends. For He rendered not these things
unto us, allowing us to continue enemies, but having made us
friends unto Himself. But when I say that Christ is the cause of
our reconciliation, I say the Father is so also: when I say that
the Father gave, I say the Son gave also. “For all things were
made by Him;” (<scripRef passage="John i. 3" id="v.xi-p39.1" parsed="|John|1|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.1.3">John i.

the Author. For we ran not unto Him, but He Himself called us.
How called He us? By the sacrifice of Christ.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xi-p40">“And gave unto us the ministry of
reconciliation.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xi-p41">Here again he sets forth the dignity of the
Apostles; showing how great a thing was committed to their hands,
and the surpassing greatness of the love of God. For even when
they would not hear the Ambassador that came, He was not
exasperated nor left them to themselves, but continueth to exhort
them both in His own person and by others. Who can be fittingly
amazed at this solicitude? The Son Who came to reconcile, His
True and Only-Begotten, was slain, yet not even so did the Father
turn away from His murderers; nor say, “I sent My Son as an
Ambassador, but they not only would not hear Him, but even slew and
crucified Him, it is meet henceforth to leave them to
themselves:” but quite the contrary, when the Son departed, He
entrusted the business to us; for he says, “gave unto us the
ministry of reconciliation.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xi-p42">[5.] <scripRef passage="2 Cor. 5.19" id="v.xi-p42.1" parsed="|2Cor|5|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.5.19">Ver. 19</scripRef>. “To wit, that God was in
Christ reconciling the world unto Himself, not reckoning unto them
their tresspasses.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xi-p43">Seest thou love surpassing all expression, all
conception? Who was the aggrieved one? Himself. Who first
sought the reconciliation? Himself. ‘And yet,’ saith one,
‘He sent the Son, He did not come Himself.’ The Son indeed it
was He sent; still not He alone besought, but both with Him and by
Him the Father; wherefore he said, that, “God was reconciling the
world unto Himself in Christ:” that is, by Christ<note place="end" n="696" id="v.xi-p43.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xi-p44"> [It is clear that Chrysostom did not favor the view
given in the A.V., which connects the substantive verb with the
phrase “in Christ,” and separates it from the participle. He
rather agrees with the Rev. Version which obliterates the comma
after Christ, and makes the emphasis to lie on the reconciliation
effected in or through Christ, and not on the fact that God was in
Christ,—a proposition true enough in itself, but not before the
Apostle’s mind at this time. C.]</p></note>. For
seeing he had said, “Who gave unto us the ministry of
reconciliation;” he here used a corrective, saying, “Think not
that we act of our own authority<note place="end" n="697" id="v.xi-p44.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xi-p45"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xi-p45.1">αὑθενται</span>.</p></note> in the business: we are
ministers; and He that doeth the whole is God, Who reconciled the
world by the Only-Begotten.” And how did He reconcile it unto
Himself? For this is the marvel, not that it was made a friend
only, but also by this way a friend. This way? What way? 
Forgiving them their sins; for in no other way was it possible.
Wherefore also he added, “Not reckoning unto them their
tresspasses.” For had it been His pleasure to require an
account of the things we had transgressed in, we should all have
perished; for “all died.” But nevertheless though our sins
were so great, He not only did not require satisfaction, but even
became reconciled; He not only forgave, but He did not even
“reckon.” So ought we also to forgive our enemies, that
ourselves too may obtain the like forgiveness.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xi-p46">“And having committed unto us the word of
reconciliation.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xi-p47">For neither have we come now on any odious office;
but to make all men friends with God. For He saith, ‘Since they
were not persuaded by Me, do ye continue beseeching until ye have
persuaded them.’ Wherefore also he added,</p>

not Christ only, but even 
<pb n="334" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_334.html" id="v.xi-Page_334" />the Father? For what he says is this: ‘The
Father sent the Son to beseech, and to be His Ambassador unto
mankind. When then He was slain and gone, we succeeded to the
embassy; and in His stead and the Father’s we beseech you. So
greatly doth He prize mankind that He gave up even the Son, and
that knowing He would be slain, and made us Apostles for your
sakes; so that he said with reason, “All things are for your
sakes.” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. iv. 15" id="v.xi-p50.2" parsed="|2Cor|4|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.4.15">2 Cor. iv.

therefore ambassadors on behalf of Christ,” that is, instead of
Christ; for we have succeeded to His functions.’ But if this
appears to thee a great thing, hear also what follows wherein he
shows that they do this not in His stead only, but also in stead of
the Father. For therefore he also added, “As though God were
entreating by us.” ‘For not by the Son Himself only doth He
beseech, but also by us who have succeeded to the office of the
Son. Think not therefore,’ he says, ‘that by us you are
entreated; Christ Himself, the Father Himself of Christ, beseeches
you by us. What can come up to this excess [of goodness]? He
was outraged who had conferred innumerable benefits; having been
outraged, He not only exacted not justice, but even gave His son
that we might be reconciled. They that received Him were not
reconciled, but even slew Him. Again, He sent other ambassadors
to beseech, and though these are sent, it is Himself that
entreats. And what doth He entreat? “Be ye reconciled unto
God.” And he said not, ‘Reconcile God to yourselves;’ for
it is not He that beareth enmity, but ye; for God never beareth
enmity. Urging moreover his cause, like an ambassador on his
mission,<note place="end" n="699" id="v.xi-p50.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.xi-p51"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xi-p51.1">δικαιολογούμενος</span>.</p></note> he
says,</p>

He made to be sin on our account.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xi-p53">‘I say nothing of what has gone before, that
ye have outraged Him, Him that had done you no wrong, Him that had
done you good, that He exacted not justice, that He is first to
beseech, though first outraged; let none of these things be set
down at present. Ought ye not in justice to be reconciled for
this one thing only that He hath done to you now?’ And what
hath He done? “Him that knew no sin He made to be sin, for
you.” For had He achieved nothing but done only this, think how
great a thing it were to give His Son for those that had outraged
Him. But now He hath both well achieved mighty things, and
besides, hath suffered Him that did no wrong to be punished for
those who had done wrong. But he did not say this: but
mentioned that which is far greater than this. What then is
this? “Him that knew no sin,” he says, Him that was
righteousness itself<note place="end" n="700" id="v.xi-p53.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xi-p54"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xi-p54.1">αὐτοδικαιοσύνην</span>.</p></note>, “He made sin,” that is
suffered as a sinner to be condemned, as one cursed to die.
“For cursed is he that hangeth on a tree.” (<scripRef passage="Gal. iii. 13" id="v.xi-p54.2" parsed="|Gal|3|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gal.3.13">Gal. iii. 13</scripRef>.) For to die thus was far
greater than to die; and this he also elsewhere implying, saith,
“Becoming obedient unto death, yea the death of the cross.”
(<scripRef passage="Philip. ii. 8" id="v.xi-p54.3" parsed="|Phil|2|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Phil.2.8">Philip. ii. 8</scripRef>.) For this thing carried
with it not only punishment, but also disgrace. Reflect therefore
how great things He bestowed on thee. For a great thing indeed it
were for even a sinner to die for any one whatever; but when He who
undergoes this both is righteous and dieth for sinners; and not
dieth only, but even as one cursed; and not as cursed [dieth] only,
but thereby freely bestoweth upon us those great goods which we
never looked for; (for he says, that “we might become the
righteousness of God in Him;”) what words, what thought shall be
adequate to realize these things? ‘For the righteous,’ saith
he, ‘He made a sinner; that He might make the sinners
righteous.’  Yea rather, he said not even so, but what was
greater far; for the word he employed is not the habit, but the
quality itself. For he said not “made” [Him] a sinner, but
“sin;” not, ‘Him that had not sinned’ only, but “that had
not even known sin; that we” also “might become,” he did not
say ‘righteous,’ but, “righteousness,” and, “the
righteousness of God.” For this is [the righteousness] “of
God” when we are justified not by works, (in which case it were
necessary that not a spot even should be found,) but by grace, in
which case all sin is done away. And this at the same time that
it suffers us not to be lifted up, (seeing the whole is the free
gift of God,) teaches us also the greatness of that which is
given. For that which was before was a righteousness of the Law
and of works, but this is “the righteousness of God.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xi-p55">[6.] Reflecting then on these things, let us fear
these words more than hell; let us reverence the things [they
express] more than the kingdom, and let us not deem it grievous to
be punished, but to sin. For were He not to punish us, we ought
to take vengeance on ourselves, who have been so ungrateful towards
our Benefactor. Now he that hath an object of affection, hath
often even slain himself, when unsuccessful in his love; and though
successful, if he hath been guilty of a fault towards her, counts
it not fit that he should even live; and shall not we, when we
outrage One so loving and gentle, cast ourselves into the fire of
hell? Shall I say something strange, and marvellous, and to many
perhaps incredible? To one who hath understanding and loveth the
Lord as it behoveth to love Him, there will be greater comfort if
punished after provoking One so loving, than if 
<pb n="335" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_335.html" id="v.xi-Page_335" />not punished. And this one may see by the
common practice. For he that has wronged his dearest friend feels
then the greatest relief, when he has wreaked vengeance on himself
and suffered evil. And accordingly David said, “I the shepherd
have sinned, and I the shepherd have done amiss; and these the
flock, what have they done? Let Thy hand be upon me, and upon my
father’s house.” (<scripRef passage="2 Sam. xxiv. 17" id="v.xi-p55.1" parsed="|2Sam|24|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Sam.24.17">2
Sam. xxiv. 17</scripRef>.
LXX.) And when he lost Absalom he wreaked the extremest vengeance
upon himself, although he was not the injurer but the injured; but
nevertheless, because he loved the departed exceedingly, he racked
himself with anguish, in this manner comforting himself. Let us
therefore also, when we sin against Him Whom we ought not to sin
against, take vengeance on ourselves. See you not those who have
lost true-born children, that they therefore both beat themselves
and tear their hair, because to punish themselves for the sake of
those they loved carries comfort with it. But if, when we have
caused no harm to those dearest to us, to suffer because of what
hath befallen them brings consolation; when we ourselves are the
persons who have given provocation and wrong, will it not much
rather be a relief to us to suffer the penalty and will not the
being unpunished punish? Every one in a manner will see this.
If any love Christ as it behoveth to love Him, he knoweth what I
say; how, even when He forgiveth, he will not endure to go
unpunished; for thou undergoest the severest punishment in having
provoked Him. And I know indeed that I am speaking what will not
be believed by the many; but nevertheless it is so as I have
said. If then we love Christ as it behoveth to love Him, we shall
punish ourselves when we sin. For to those who love any
whomsover, not the suffering somewhat because they have provoked
the beloved one is unpleasing; but above all, that they have
provoked the person loved. And if this last when angered doth not
punish, he hath tortured his lover more; but if he exacts
satisfaction, he hath comforted him rather. Let us therefore not
fear hell, but offending God; for it is more grievous than that
when He turns away in wrath: this is worse than all, this heavier
than all. And that thou mayest learn what a thing it is, consider
this which I say. If one that was himself a king, beholding a
robber and malefactor under punishment, gave his well-beloved son,
his only-begotten and true, to be slain; and transferred the death
and the guilt as well, from him to his son, (who was himself of no
such character,) that he might both save the condemned man and
clear him from his evil reputation<note place="end" n="701" id="v.xi-p55.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xi-p56"> [The comparison here made shows clearly how the

does not with Augustin and others take <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xi-p56.2"> ἀμαρτίαν</span> in the sense of a
sin-offering, a sense which it is very doubtful if the word ever
has, and one that here would be inconsistent with the use of the
same word in the clause immediately preceding as well as with the
evidently designed antithesis between “sin” and
“righteousness.” But he regards the abstract as used for the
concrete, which is certainly the true view. The phrase is, as
Beet says, “practically the same as, but stronger than, <i>made
to be a sinner</i>. By laying upon Christ the punishment of our
sin, God made him to be a visible embodiment of the deadly and
far-reaching power of sin.” But Chrysostom shows by his
comments his acceptance not only of the vicarious atonement, but
also of the gratuitous justification, as set forth concisely yet
distinctly in this pregnant utterance. There are passages in
these and other Homilies which look as if the author held to
justification by works, but here he is outspoken to the contrary.
Justification comes by grace, not merit, and the righteousness
required is the free gift of God. C.]</p></note>; and then if, having subsequently
promoted him to great dignity, he had yet, after thus saving him
and advancing him to that glory unspeakable, been outraged by the
person that had received such treatment: would not that man, if
he had any sense, have chosen ten thousand deaths rather than
appear guilty of so great ingratitude? This then let us also now
consider with ourselves, and groan bitterly for the provocations we
have offered our Benefactor; nor let us therefore presume, because
though outraged He bears it with long-suffering; but rather for
this very reason be full of remorse<note place="end" n="702" id="v.xi-p56.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.xi-p57"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xi-p57.1">δακνώμεθα</span>.</p></note>. For amongst men too, when one

rained upon him ten thousand reproaches. Now if in the case of
men we feel ashamed when offering insults we meet with
long-suffering; much rather, in respect to God, ought they to be
afraid who go on continually sinning yet suffer no calamity. For,
even for evil unto their own heads is the unspeakable punishment
treasured up for them. These things then bearing in mind, let us
above all things be afraid of sin; for this is punishment, this is
hell, this is ten thousand ills. And let us not only be afraid
of, but also flee from it, and strive to please God continually;
for this is the kingdom, this is life, this is ten thousand
goods. So shall we also even here obtain already the kingdom and
the good things to come; whereunto may we all attain, through the
grace and love towards men of our Lord Jesus Christ; with Whom to
the Father, with the Holy Spirit, be glory, might, honor, now and
for ever, and world without end. Amen.</p>

<p class="c27" id="v.xii-p3">And working together with Him we intreat also that
ye receive not the grace of God in vain. For he saith, At an
acceptable time I hearkened unto thee. And in a day of salvation
did I succor thee.</p>

<p class="c24" id="v.xii-p4"><span class="c18" id="v.xii-p4.1">For</span> since he said, God
beseeches, and we are ambassadors and suppliants unto you, that ye
be “reconciled unto God:” lest they should become supine, he
hereby again alarms and arouses them, saying: “We intreat that
ye receive not the grace of God in vain.” ‘For let us not,’
he says, ‘therefore be at ease, because He beseeches and hath
sent some to be ambassadors; nay, but for this very reason let us
make haste to please God and to collect spiritual merchandise;’
as also he said above, “The love of God constraineth us,”
(<scripRef passage="2 Cor. 5.14" id="v.xii-p4.2" parsed="|2Cor|5|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.5.14">ch.
v. 14</scripRef>.) that is presseth,
driveth, urgeth us, ‘that ye may not after so much affectionate
care, by being supine and exhibiting no nobleness, miss of such
great blessings. Do not therefore because He hath sent some to
exhort you, deem that this will always be so. It will be so until
His second coming; until then He beseeches, so long as we are here;
but after that is judgment and punishment.’ Therefore, he says,
“we are constrained.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xii-p5">For not only from the greatness of the blessings and
His loving kindness, but also from the shortness of the time he
urgeth them continually. Wherefore he saith also elsewhere,
“For now is our salvation nearer.” (<scripRef passage="Rom. xiii. 11" id="v.xii-p5.1" parsed="|Rom|13|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.13.11">Rom. xiii. 11</scripRef>.) And again; “The Lord is
at hand.” (<scripRef passage="Philip. iv. 5" id="v.xii-p5.2" parsed="|Phil|4|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Phil.4.5">Philip. iv.
5</scripRef>.) But here he does
something yet more. For not from the fact that the remainder of
the time is short and little, but also from its being the only
season available, for salvation, he incited them.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xii-p6">For, “Behold,” he saith, “now is the
acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation.” Let us
therefore not let slip the favorable opportunity but display a zeal
worthy of the grace. For therefore is it that we also press
forward, knowing both the shortness and the suitableness of the
time. Wherefore also he said; “And working together we intreat
also. Working together” with you; ‘for we work together with
you, rather than with God for Whom we are ambassadors. For He is
in need of nothing, but the salvation all passeth over to you.’
But if it is even with God that he speaks of working together, he
repudiates not even this [interpretation]; for he says in another
place, “we are God’s fellow-workers:” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. iii. 9" id="v.xii-p6.1" parsed="|1Cor|3|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.3.9">1 Cor. iii. 9</scripRef>.) in this way, saith he, to
save men. Again, “We entreat also.” For he indeed, when
beseeching, doth not barely beseech, but sets forth these His just
claims; namely, that He gave His Son, the Righteous One that did
not so much as know sin, and made Him to be sin for us sinners,
that we might become righteous: which claims having, and being
God, He displayed such goodness. But what we beseech is that ye
would receive the benefit and not reject the gift. Be persuaded
therefore by us, and “receive not the grace in vain.” For
lest they should think that this of itself is “reconciliation,”
believing on Him that calleth; he adds these words, requiting that
earnestness which respects the life. For, for one who hath been
freed from sins and made a friend to wallow in the former things,
is to return again unto enmity, and to “receive the grace in
vain,” in respect of the life. For from “the grace” we reap
no benefit towards salvation, if we live impurely; nay, we are even
harmed, having this greater aggravation even of our sins, in that
after such knowledge and such a gift we have gone back to our
former vices. This however he does not mention as yet: that he
may not make his work harsh, but says only that we reap no
benefit. Then he also reminds of a prophecy, urging and
compelling them to bestir themselves in order to lay hold of their
own salvation.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xii-p7">“For,” saith he, “He saith,</p>

<p class="c22" id="v.xii-p8">“At an acceptable time I hearkened unto thee,</p>

<p class="c31" id="v.xii-p9">“And in a day of salvation did I succor thee:</p>

<p id="v.xii-p10">“behold, now is the acceptable time: behold, now is the day
of salvation.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xii-p11">“The acceptable time.” What is this? That
<pb n="337" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_337.html" id="v.xii-Page_337" />of the Gift, that of the
Grace, when it is appointed not that an account should be required
of our sins nor penalty exacted; but besides being delivered, that
we should also enjoy ten thousand goods, righteousness,
sanctification, and all the rest. For how much toil would it have
behoved us to undergo in order to obtain this “time!” But,
behold, without our toiling at all it hath come, bringing remission
of all that was before. Wherefore also He calls it
“acceptable,” because He both accepted those that had
transgressed in ten thousand things, and not acceded merely, but
advanced them to the highest honor; just as when a monarch arrives,
it is a time not for judgment, but for grace and pardon.
Wherefore also He calleth it acceptable. Whilst then we are yet
in the lists<note place="end" n="703" id="v.xii-p11.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xii-p12"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xii-p12.1">ἐν τῷ

are at work in the vineyard, whilst the eleventh hour is left [us],
let us draw nigh and show forth life; for it is also easy. For he
that striveth for the mastery<note place="end" n="704" id="v.xii-p12.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xii-p13"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xii-p13.1">ἀ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.xii-p13.2">γωνὶζόμενος</span>, as

gift hath been shed forth, when so great grace, will early obtain
the prizes. For in the case of monarchs here below also, at the
time of their festivals, and when they appear in the dress of
Consuls, he who bringeth a small offering receiveth large gifts;
but on the days in which they sit in judgment, much strictness,
much sifting is requisite. Let us too therefore strive for the
mastery in the time of this gift. It is a day of grace, of grace
divine; wherefore with ease even we shall obtain the crown. For
if when laden with so great evils He both received and delivered
us: when delivered from all and contributing our part, shall He
not rather accept us?</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xii-p14">[2.] Then, as it is his constant wont, namely, to
place himself before them and bid them hence to take their example,
so he does in this place also. Wherefore also he addeth,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xii-p15"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 6.3" id="v.xii-p15.1" parsed="|2Cor|6|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.6.3">Ver. 3</scripRef>. “Giving no occasion
of stumbling, that our ministration<note place="end" n="705" id="v.xii-p15.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xii-p16"> The ministry.</p></note> be not blamed,” persuading them
not from considering “the time” only, but also those that had
successfully labored with them. And behold with what absence of
pride<note place="end" n="706" id="v.xii-p16.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xii-p17"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xii-p17.1">ἀ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.xii-p17.2">τύφως</span>.</p></note>. For he
said not, ‘Look at us how we are such and such,’ but, for the
present, it is only to do away accusation that he relates his own
conduct. And he mentions two chief points of a blameless life,
“none” in “any” thing. And he said not ‘accusation,’
but, what was far less, “occasion of stumbling;” that is,
giving ground against us to none for censure, for condemnation,
“that our ministration be not blamed;” that is, that none may
take hold of it. And again, he said not, ‘that it be not
accused,’ but that it may not have the least fault, nor any one
have it in his power to animadvert upon it in any
particular.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xii-p18"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 5.4" id="v.xii-p18.1" parsed="|2Cor|5|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.5.4">Ver. 4</scripRef>.
“But in every thing commending ourselves as ministers of
God.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xii-p19">This is far greater.  For it is not the same
thing to be free from accusation; and to exhibit such a character
as in everything to appear “ministers of God.” For neither is
it the same thing to be quit of accusation, and to be covered<note place="end" n="707" id="v.xii-p19.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xii-p20"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xii-p20.1">βρύειυ</span>,
‘blossom.’</p></note> with
praises. And he said not appearing, but “commending,” that is
‘proving.’ Then he mentions also whence they became such.
Whence then was it? “In much patience,” he says, laying the
foundation of those good things. Wherefore he said not barely
“patience,” but “much,” and he shows also how great it
was. For to bear some one or two things is no great matter. But
he addeth even snow storms of trials in the words, “In
afflictions, in necessities.” This is a heightening of
affliction, when the evils are unavoidable, and there lies upon one
as it were a necessity hardly extricable<note place="end" n="708" id="v.xii-p20.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xii-p21"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xii-p21.1">δυσδιεξὸδευτος</span>.</p></note> of misfortune. “In
distresses.” Either he means those of hunger and of other
necessaries, or else simply those of their trials.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xii-p22"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 6.5" id="v.xii-p22.1" parsed="|2Cor|6|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.6.5">Ver. 5</scripRef>. “In stripes, in

comment of St. Chrysostom.</p></note>.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xii-p24">Yet every one of these by itself was
intolerable, the being scourged only, and being bound only, and
being unable through persecution to remain fixed<note place="end" n="710" id="v.xii-p24.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xii-p25"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xii-p25.1">στήναι</span>.</p></note> any where, (for this is in
‘tossings to and fro,’) but when both all, and all at once,
assail, consider what a soul they need. Then along with the
things from without, he mentions those imposed by
himself.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xii-p26"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 6.5,6" id="v.xii-p26.1" parsed="|2Cor|6|5|6|6" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.6.5-2Cor.6.6">Ver. 5, 6</scripRef>. “In labors, in watchings,
in fastings; in pureness.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xii-p27">But by “pureness” here, he means either
chasteness again, or general purity, or incorruptness, or even his
preaching the Gospel freely.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xii-p28">“In knowledge.” What is “in knowledge?”
In wisdom such as is given from God; that which is truly knowledge;
not as those that seem to be wise and boast of their acquaintance
<pb n="338" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_338.html" id="v.xii-Page_338" />with the heathen discipline,
but are deficient in this.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xii-p29">“In long-suffering, in kindness.” For this
also is a great note of a noble soul, though exasperated and goaded
on every side, to bear all with long-suffering. Then to show
whence he became such, he added;</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xii-p30">“In the Holy Ghost.” ‘For in Him,’
he saith, ‘we do all these good works.’ But observe when it
is that he has mentioned the aid of the Holy Ghost. After he had
set forth what was from himself. Moreover, he seems to me to say
another thing herein. What then is this? Namely, ‘we have
both been filled with abundance of the Spirit and hereby also give
a proof of our Apostleship in that we have been counted worthy of
spiritual gifts.’ For if this be grace also, yet still he
himself was the cause who by his good works and his toils<note place="end" n="711" id="v.xii-p30.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xii-p31"> Literally ‘sweats.’</p></note> attracted
that grace. And if any should assert that besides what has been
said, he shows that in his use of the gifts of the Spirit also he
gave none offence; he would not miss of his meaning. For they who
received the [gift of] tongues amongst them and were lifted up,
were blamed. For it is possible for one even in receiving a gift
of the Spirit, not to use it aright. ‘But not so we,’ he
saith, ‘but in the Spirit also, that is, in the gifts also, we
have been blameless.’</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xii-p32">“In love unfeigned.” This was the cause of all
those good things; this made him what he was; this caused the
Spirit also to abide with him, by Whose aid also all things were
rightly done of him.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xii-p33"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 6.7" id="v.xii-p33.1" parsed="|2Cor|6|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.6.7">Ver. 7</scripRef>.
“In the word of truth.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xii-p34"> A thing he says in many places, that ‘we
continued neither to handle the word of God deceitfully nor to
adulterate it.’</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xii-p35">“In the power of God.” That which he always
does ascribing nothing to himself but the whole to God, and
imputing whatsoever he hath done aright to Him, this he hath done
here also. For since he uttered great things, and affirmed that
he had manifested in all things an irreproachable life and exalted
wisdom, he ascribes this to the Spirit and to God. For neither
were those commonplace things which he had said. For if it be a
difficult thing even for one who lives in quiet to do aright and be
irreproachable, consider him who was harassed by so great
temptations, and yet shone forth through all, what a spirit he was
of!  And yet he underwent not these alone, but even far more than
these, as he mentions next. And what is indeed marvelous is, not
that he was irreproachable though sailing in such mighty waves, nor
that he endured all nobly, but all with pleasure even. Which
things, all, he makes clear to us by the next words, saying,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xii-p36">“By the armor of righteousness on the right and
the left.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xii-p37">[3.] Seest thou his self-possession of soul and
well-strung spirit? For he shows that afflictions are arms not
only which strike not down, but do even fortify and make
stronger. And he calls those things ‘left,’ which seem to be
painful; for such those are which bring with them the reward.
Wherefore then doth he call them thus? Either in conformity with
the conception of the generality, or because God commanded us to
pray that we enter not into temptation.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xii-p38"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 6.8" id="v.xii-p38.1" parsed="|2Cor|6|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.6.8">Ver. 8</scripRef>.
“By glory and dishonor, by evil report and good report.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xii-p39">What saying thou? That thou enjoyest honor,
and setting down this as a great thing? ‘Yes,’ he saith.
Why, forsooth? For to bear dishonor indeed is a great thing, but
to partake of honor requires not a vigorous<note place="end" n="712" id="v.xii-p39.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xii-p40"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xii-p40.1">νέανικῆς</span>.</p></note> soul. Nay, it needs a vigorous
and exceeding great soul, that he who enjoys it may not be thrown
and break his neck<note place="end" n="713" id="v.xii-p40.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xii-p41"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xii-p41.1">ἐ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.xii-p41.2">κτραχηλισθῆναι</span>.</p></note>. Wherefore he glories in this as
well as in that, for he shone equally in both. But how is it a
weapon of righteousness? Because that the teachers are held in
honor induceth many unto godliness. And besides, this is a proof
of good works, and this glorifieth God. And this is, further, an
instance of the wise contrivance of God, that by things which are
opposite He brings in the Preaching. For consider. Was Paul
bound? This too was on behalf of the Gospel. For, saith he,
“the things which happened unto me have fallen out unto the
progress of the Gospel; so that most of the brethren, being
confident through my bonds, are more abundantly bold to speak the
word without fear.” (<scripRef passage="Philip. i. 12, 14" id="v.xii-p41.3" parsed="|Phil|1|12|0|0;|Phil|1|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Phil.1.12 Bible:Phil.1.14">Philip. i. 12, 14</scripRef>.) Again, did he enjoy
honor? This too again rendered them more forward. “By evil
report and good report.” For not only did he bear those things
nobly which happen to the body, the ‘afflictions,’ and whatever
he enumerated, but those also which touch the soul; for neither are
these wont to disturb slightly. Jeremiah at least having borne
many temptations, gave in<note place="end" n="714" id="v.xii-p41.4"><p class="endnote" id="v.xii-p42"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xii-p42.1">ἀ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.xii-p42.2">πηγόρευε</span>.</p></note> upon these, and when he was
reproached, said, “I will not prophesy, neither will I name the
Name of the Lord.<note place="end" n="715" id="v.xii-p42.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.xii-p43"> So Chrys. not exactly agreeing either with the
English Version or the LXX.</p></note>”
(<scripRef passage="Jer. xx. 9" id="v.xii-p43.1" parsed="|Jer|20|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Jer.20.9">Jer. xx. 9</scripRef>.) And David too many places
complains of reproach. Isaiah also, after many things, exhorteth
concerning this, saying, “Fear ye not the reproach of men,
neither be ye overcome by their reviling.” (<scripRef passage="Is. li. 7" id="v.xii-p43.2" parsed="|Isa|51|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.51.7">Is. li. 7</scripRef>. LXX.) And again, Christ
also to His disciples; “When they shall speak all manner of evil
against you falsely, rejoice and be exceeding glad,” (<scripRef passage="Matt. v. 11, 12" id="v.xii-p43.3" parsed="|Matt|5|11|5|12" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.11-Matt.5.12">Matt. v. 11, 12</scripRef>.) He saith, “for great is
your reward in heaven.” Elsewhere too He 
<pb n="339" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_339.html" id="v.xii-Page_339" />says,” And leap for joy.” (<scripRef passage="Luke vi. 23" id="v.xii-p43.4" parsed="|Luke|6|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.6.23">Luke vi. 23</scripRef>.) But He would not have made
the reward so great, had not the contest been a great one. For in
tortures the body also shareth the anguish with the soul; for the
pain is both of the body and of the soul; but here it is of the
soul alone. Many at any rate have fallen by these alone, and have
lost their own souls. And to Job also the reproaches of his
friends appeared more grievous than the worms and the sores. For
there is nothing, there is nothing more intolerable to those in
affliction than a word capable of stinging the soul. Wherefore
along with the perils and the toils he names these also, saying,
“By glory and dishonor.” At any rate, many of the Jews also
on account of glory derived from the many would not believe. For
they feared, not lest they should be punished, but lest they should
be put out of the synagogue. Wherefore He saith, “How can ye
believe which receive glory one of another?” (<scripRef passage="John v. 44" id="v.xii-p43.5" parsed="|John|5|44|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.5.44">John v. 44</scripRef>.) And we may see numbers who
have indeed despised all dangers, but have been worsted by
glory.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xii-p44">[4.] “As deceivers, and yet true.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xii-p45">This is, “by evil report and good report.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xii-p48">As under sentence of death and condemned; which was
itself also matter of dishonor. But this he said, to show both
the unspeakable power of God and their own patience. For so far
as those who plotted against us were concerned, we died; and this
is what all suppose; but by God’s aid we escaped the dangers.
Then to manifest also on what account God permits these things, he
added, “As chastened, and not killed.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xii-p49">Showing that the gain accruing to them from their

the other points, contraries were produced by their contraries.
But if thou marvellest how it is possible for one that hath nothing
to have all things, let us bring forth this man himself into the

substance, but of their very eyes even. “If possible,” he
says, “ye would have plucked out your eyes, and have given them

the cities received as an angel, for whom they would have plucked
out their own eyes and have given them to him, (<scripRef passage="Gal. iv. 14, 15" id="v.xii-p62.2" parsed="|Gal|4|14|4|15" osisRef="Bible:Gal.4.14-Gal.4.15">Gal. iv. 14, 15</scripRef>.) he for whom they laid down

see the spiritual also, thou wilt find him in these things also
especially rich. For he that was so dear to the King of all as
even to share in unspeakable things with the Lord of the angels,
(<scripRef passage="2 Cor. 12.4" id="v.xii-p62.4" parsed="|2Cor|12|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.12.4">ch.

not he more opulent than all men, and had all things? Devils had

fled away<note place="end" n="722" id="v.xii-p62.5"><p class="endnote" id="v.xii-p63"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xii-p63.1">ἐ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.xii-p63.2">δραπέτευσε</span>.</p></note>.</p>

us therefore, when we suffer aught for Christ’s sake, not merely
bear it nobly but also rejoice. If we fast, let us leap for joy
as if enjoying luxury; if we be insulted, let us dance as if
praised; if we spend, let us feel as if gaining; if we bestow on
the poor, let us count ourselves to receive: for he that gives
not thus will not give readily. When then thou hast a mind to
scatter abroad, look not at this only in almsgiving, but also in
every kind of virtue, compute not alone the severity of the toils,
but also the sweetness of the prizes; and before all the subjects
of this wrestling, our Lord Jesus; and thou wilt readily enter upon
the contest, and wilt live the whole time in pleasure. For
nothing is wont so to cause pleasure as a good conscience.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xii-p65">Therefore Paul indeed, though wounded every

lamentations from no other cause than that they have not a mind
full of heavenly philosophy. For, tell me, wherefore the
lamentation? Because thou art poor, and in want of necessaries? 
Surely for this thou oughtest rather to make lamentation, [not]<note place="end" n="724" id="v.xii-p66.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xii-p67"> All the <span class="c18" id="v.xii-p67.1">mss</span>. have
the word “not,” but the sense seems to require its
omission.</p></note> because thou
weepest, not because thou art poor, but because thou art
mean-spirited; not because thou hast not money, but because thou
prizest money so highly. Paul died daily, yet wept not but even
rejoiced; he fought with continual hunger, yet grieved not but even
gloried in it. And dost thou, because thou hast not all the
year’s provisions stored up, grieve and beat thyself? 
‘Yes,’ he replies, ‘for he had to care only for his own
needs, whilst I have besides to care for servants, and children,
and wife.’ Rather, he alone had not to care for his own needs,
but for the whole world’s. And thou indeed [hast to care] for
one household, but he for those so many poor at Jerusalem, for
those in Macedonia, for those everywhere in poverty, for those who
give to them no less than for those who receive. For his care for
the world was of a twofold nature, both that they might not be
destitute of necessaries, and that they might be rich in spiritual
things. And thy famishing children distress not thee so much as
all the concerns of the faithful did him. Why do I say, of the
faithful? For neither was he free from care for the unfaithful,
but was so eaten up with it that he wished even to become accursed
for their sakes; but thou, were a famine to rage ten thousand times
over, wouldest never choose to die for any whomsoever. And thou
indeed carest for one woman, but he for the Churches throughout the
world. For he saith, “My anxiety for all the Churches.”
(<scripRef passage="2 Cor. 11.28" id="v.xii-p67.2" parsed="|2Cor|11|28|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.11.28">ch. xi. 28</scripRef>.) How long then, O man, dost
thou trifle, comparing thyself with Paul; and wilt not cease from
this thy much meanness of spirit? For it behoveth to weep, not
when we are in poverty but when we sin; for this is worthy of
lamentations, as all the other things are of ridicule even.
‘But,’ he saith, ‘this is not all that grieves me; but that
also such an one is in power, whilst I am unhonored and
outcast.’ And what is this? for the blessed Paul too appeared
to the many to be unhonored and an outcast. ‘But,’ saith he,
‘he was Paul.’ Plainly then not the nature of the things, but
thy feebleness of spirit causeth thy desponding. Lament not
therefore thy poverty, but thyself who art so minded, yea rather,
lament not thyself, but reform thee; and seek not for money, but
pursue that which maketh men of more cheerful countenance than
thousands of money, philosophy and virtue. For where indeed these
are, there is no harm in poverty; and where these are not there is
no good in money. For tell me, what good is it when men are rich
indeed, but have beggarly souls? Thou dost not bewail thyself, so
much as that rich man himself, because he hath not the wealth of
all. And if he doth not weep as thou dost, yet lay open his
conscience, and thou wilt see his wailings and lamentations.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xii-p68">Wilt thou that I show thee thine own riches,

all? and do not all enjoy it equally, both poor and rich? And the
wreath of the stars and the orb of the moon, are they not left
equally to all? Yea, rather, if I must speak somewhat marvellous,
we poor enjoy these more than they. For they indeed being for the
most part steeped in drunkenness, and passing their time in
revellings and deep sleep, do not even perceive these things, being
always under cover<note place="end" n="726" id="v.xii-p69.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xii-p70"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xii-p70.1">ὑ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.xii-p70.2">πωῤόφιοι</span>.</p></note> and reared in the shade<note place="end" n="727" id="v.xii-p70.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.xii-p71"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xii-p71.1">σκιατραφούμενοι</span>.</p></note>: but the
poor do more than any enjoy the luxury of these elements. And
further, if thou wilt look into the air which is every where
diffused, thou wilt see the poor man enjoying it in greater both
freshness and abundance. For wayfarers and husbandmen
enjoy <pb n="341" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_341.html" id="v.xii-Page_341" />these luxuries
more than the inhabitants of the city; and again, of those same
inhabitants of the city, the handicraftsmen more than those who are
drunken all the day. What too of the earth, is not this left
common to all? ‘No,’ he saith. How sayest thou so? tell
me. ‘Because the rich man, even in the city, having gotten
himself several plethra, raises up long fences round them; and in
the country cuts off for himself many portions.’ What then? 
When he cuts them off, does he alone enjoy them? By no means,
though he should contend for it ever so earnestly. For the
produce he is compelled to distribute amongst all, and for thee he
cultivates grain, and wine, and oil, and every where ministers unto
thee. And those long fences and buildings, after his untold
expense and his toils and drudgery he is preparing for thy use,
receiving from thee only a small piece of silver for so great a
service. And in baths and every where, one may see the same thing
obtaining; the rich of it all with perfect ease. And his
enjoyment of the earth is no more than thine; for sure he filleth
not ten stomachs, and thou only one. ‘But he partaketh of
costlier meats?’ Truly, this is no mighty superiority; howbeit,
even here, we shall find thee to have the advantage. For this
costliness is therefore thought by thee a matter of envy because
the pleasure with it is greater. Yet this is greater in the poor
man’s case; yet not pleasure only, but health also; and in this
alone is the advantage with the rich, that he maketh his
constitution feebler and collects more abundant fountains of
disease. For the poor man’s diet is all ordered according to
nature, but his through its excess resulteth in corruption and
disease.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xii-p72">[6.] But if ye will, let us also look at
this same thing in an example. For if it were requisite to light
a furnace, and then one man were to throw in silken garments and
fine linens, many and numberless, and so kindle it; and another
logs of oak and pine, what advantage would this man have over
that? None, but even disadvantage. But what? (for there is
nothing to prevent our turning the same illustration round after
another manner,) if one were to throw in logs, and another were to
light his fire under bodies, by which furnace wouldest thou like to
stand, that with the logs, or that with the bodies? Very plainly
that with the logs. For that burns naturally and is a pleasant
spectacle to the beholders: whilst this with the steam, and
juices, and smoke, and the stench of the bones would drive every
one away. Didst thou shudder at the hearing, and loathe that
furnace? Like it are the bellies of the rich. For in them one
would find more rottenness than in that furnace, and stinking
vapors, and filthy humors, because that, all over in every part,
indigestion abounds in consequence of their surfeiting. For the
natural heat not sufficing for the digestion of the whole but being
smothered under them, they lie smoking above, and the
unpleasantness produced is great. To what then should one compare
those stomachs of theirs? Yet do not be offended at what I say,
but if I do not say true things, refute me. To what then should
one compare them? for even what has been said is not enough to show
their wretched plight. I have found another resemblance yet.
What then is it? As in the sewers where there is accumulation of
refuse, of dung, hay, stubble, stones, clay, frequent stoppages
occur; and then the stream of filth overflows at top: so also it
happeneth with the stomachs of those people. For these being
stopped up below, the greater part of these villainous streams
spurts up above. But not so with the poor, but like those
fountains which well forth pure streams, and water gardens and
pleasure grounds<note place="end" n="728" id="v.xii-p72.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xii-p73"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xii-p73.1">παραδείσους</span>.</p></note>, so also are
their stomachs pure from such-like superfluities. But not such
are the stomachs of the rich, or rather of the luxurious; but they
are filled with humors, phlegm, bile, corrupted blood, putrid
rheums, and other suchlike matters. Wherefore no one, if he lives
always in luxury, can bear it even for a short time; but his life
will be spent in continual sicknesses. Wherefore I would gladly
ask them, for what end are meats given? that we may be destroyed,
or be nourished? that we may be diseased, or be strong? that we may
be healthful, or be sickly? Very plainly, for nourishment,
creating unto the body disease and sickness? But not so the poor
man; on the contrary, by his plain diet he purchases to himself
health, and vigor, and strength. Weep not then on account of
poverty, the mother of health, but even exult in it; and if thou
wouldest be rich, despise riches. For this, not the having money
but the not wanting to have it, is truly affluence. If we can
achieve this, we shall both be here more affluent than all that are
rich, and there shall obtain the good things to come, whereunto may
all we attain, through the grace and love towards men of our Lord
Jesus Christ, with Whom to the Father, with the Holy Ghost, be
glory, might, honor, now and ever, and world without end.
Amen.</p>

imprisonments, in tumult, in labors, in watchings;” and having
shown that the thing was a great good, for “as sorrowful,”
saith he, “yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich;
as having nothing, and yet possessing all things;” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. 6.10" id="v.xiii-p4.3" parsed="|2Cor|6|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.6.10">v. 10</scripRef>.) and having called those
things “armor,” for “as chastened,” saith he, “and not
killed:” and having hereby represented God’s abundant care
and power, for he saith, “that the exceeding greatness of the
power may be of God, and not of us;” (c. 
<scripRef passage="2 Cor. 4.7" id="v.xiii-p4.4" parsed="|2Cor|4|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.4.7">iv. 7</scripRef>.) and having recounted his
labors, for he saith, “we always bear about His dying;” and
that this is a clear demonstration of the Resurrection, for he
says, “that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our
mortal flesh;” (c. <scripRef passage="2 Cor. 4.10" id="v.xiii-p4.5" parsed="|2Cor|4|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.4.10">iv. 10</scripRef>.)
and of what things he was made partaker, and with what he had been
entrusted, for “we are ambassadors on behalf of Christ,” (c.
<scripRef passage="2 Cor. 3.20" id="v.xiii-p4.6" parsed="|2Cor|3|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.3.20">iii.
20</scripRef>.) saith he, “as
though God were entreating by us;” and of what things he is a
minister, namely, “not of the letter, but of the Spirit;” (c.
<scripRef passage="2 Cor. 3.6" id="v.xiii-p4.7" parsed="|2Cor|3|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.3.6">iii.
6</scripRef>.) and that he was
entitled to reverence not only on this account, but also for his
trials, for, “Thanks be to God,” saith he, “which always
causeth us to triumph:” he purposeth now also to rebuke them as
not being too well minded towards himself. But though purposing
he does not immediately come upon this, but having his discussion
of these things. For if even from his own good deeds he that
rebuketh be entitled to reverence; yet still, when he also
displayeth the love, which he bears towards those who are censured,
he maketh his speech less offensive. Therefore the Apostle also
having stepped out of the subject of his own trials and toils and
contests, passes on into speaking of his love, and in this way
toucheth them to the quick. What then are the indications of his
love? “Our mouth is open unto you, O ye Corinthians.” And
what kind of sign of love is this? or what meaning even have the
words at all? ‘We cannot endure,’ he says, ‘to be silent
towards you, but are always desiring and longing to speak to and
converse with you;’ which is the wont of those who love. For
what grasping of the hands is to the body, that is interchange of
language to the soul. And along with this he implies another
thing also. Of what kind then is this? That ‘we discourse
unto nothing.’ For since afterwards he proposes to rebuke, he
asks forgiveness, using the rebuking them with freedom as itself a
proof of his loving them exceedingly. Moreover the addition of
their name is a mark of great love and warmth and affection; for we
are accustomed to be repeating continually the bare names of those
we love.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xiii-p5">“Our heart is enlarged.” For as that
which warmeth is wont to dilate; so also to enlarge is the work of
love. For virtue is warm and fervent. This both opened the
mouth of Paul and enlarged his heart. For, ‘neither do I love
with the mouth only,’ saith he, ‘but I have also a heart in
union. Therefore I speak with openness, with my whole mouth, with
my whole mind.’ For nothing is wider than was Paul’s heart
which loved all the faithful with all the vehemence that one might
bear towards the object of his affection; this his love not being
divided and therefore weakened, but abiding in full entireness with
each. And what marvel that this was so in the case of the
faithful, seeing that even in that of the unfaithful, the heart of
Paul embraced the whole world? Therefore he said not ‘I love
you,’ but with more emphasis, “Our mouth is open, our heart is
enlarged,” we have you all within it, and not this merely, but
with much largeness of room<note place="end" n="729" id="v.xiii-p5.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xiii-p6"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xiii-p6.1">εὐρυχωρίας</span>.</p></note>. For he that is beloved walketh
with great unrestraint within the heart of him that loveth.
Wherefore he saith, “Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are
straightened in your own affections.” And this reproof, see it
administered with forbearance, as is the wont of such as love
exceed<pb n="343" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_343.html" id="v.xiii-Page_343" />ingly. He did
not say, ‘ye do not love us,’ but, ‘not in the same
measure,’ for he does not wish to touch them too sensibly. And
indeed every where one may see how he is inflamed toward the
faithful, by selecting words out of every Epistle. For to the
Romans he saith, “I long to see you;” and, “oftentimes I
purposed to come unto you;” and, “If by any means now at length
I may be prospered to come unto you.” (<scripRef passage="Rom. i. 11, 13, 10" id="v.xiii-p6.2" parsed="|Rom|1|11|0|0;|Rom|1|13|0|0;|Rom|1|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.1.11 Bible:Rom.1.13 Bible:Rom.1.10">Rom. i. 11, 13, 10</scripRef>.) And to the Galatians, he

And to themselves<note place="end" n="734" id="v.xiii-p10.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xiii-p11"> The Corinthians.</p></note> he says,
“Ye are not straitened in us.” But he does not say only that
he loves, but also that he is beloved by them, in order that hereby
also he may the rather win them. And indeed testifying to this in
them, he says, Titus came and “told us your longing, your
mourning, your zeal.” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. vii. 7" id="v.xiii-p11.1" parsed="|2Cor|7|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.7.7">2 Cor. vii. 7</scripRef>.) And to the Galatians,
“If possible, ye would have plucked out your eyes and given them
to me,” (<scripRef passage="Gal. iv. 15" id="v.xiii-p11.2" parsed="|Gal|4|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gal.4.15">Gal. iv.

Thessalonians, “What manner of entering in we had unto you.”
(<scripRef passage="1 Thess. i. 9" id="v.xiii-p11.3" parsed="|1Thess|1|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Thess.1.9">1 Thess. i. 9</scripRef>.) And to Timothy also,
“Remembering thy tears, that I may be filled with joy.”
(<scripRef passage="2 Tim. i. 4" id="v.xiii-p11.4" parsed="|2Tim|1|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Tim.1.4">2 Tim. i. 4</scripRef>.) And also throughout his
Epistles one may find him bearing this testimony to the disciples,
both that he loved and that he is loved, not however equally. And
here he saith, “Though the more abundantly I love you, the less I
be loved.” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. xii. 15" id="v.xiii-p11.5" parsed="|2Cor|12|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.12.15">2 Cor.
xii. 15</scripRef>.) This,
however, is near the end; but at present more vehemently, “Ye are
not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own
affections,” ‘You receive one,’ he says, ‘but I a whole
city, and so great a population.’ And he said not, ‘ye do not
receive us,’ but, ‘ye are straitened;’ implying indeed the
same thing but with forbearance and without touching them too
deeply.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xiii-p12"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 6.13" id="v.xiii-p12.1" parsed="|2Cor|6|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.6.13">Ver. 13</scripRef>. “Now for a recompense in
like kind (I speak as unto my children,) be ye also
enlarged.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xiii-p13">And yet it is not an equal return, first to be
loved, afterwards to love. For even if one were to contribute
that which is equal in amount, he is inferior in that he comes to
it second. ‘But nevertheless I am not going to reckon
strictly,<note place="end" n="735" id="v.xiii-p13.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xiii-p14"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xiii-p14.1">οὑδὲν

‘and if ye after having received the first advances<note place="end" n="736" id="v.xiii-p14.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xiii-p15"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xiii-p15.1">τὰς ἀρχὰς</span>.</p></note> from me do
but show forth the same amount, I am well-pleased and
contented.’ Then to show that to do this was even a debt, and
that what he said was void of flattery, he saith, “I speak as
unto my children.” What meaneth, “as unto my children?”
‘I ask no great thing, if being your father I wish to be loved by
you.’ And see wisdom and moderation of mind. He mentions not
here his dangers on their behalf, and his labors, and his deaths,
although he had many to tell of: (so free from pride is he!) but
his love: and on this account he claims to be loved;
‘because,’ saith he, ‘I was your father, because I
exceedingly burn for you,’ [for] it is often especially offensive
to the person beloved when a man sets forth his benefits to him;
for he seems to reproach. Wherefore Paul doth not this; but, 
‘like children, love your father,’ saith he, which rather
proceeds from instinct<note place="end" n="737" id="v.xiii-p15.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xiii-p16"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xiii-p16.1">φυσέως</span>.</p></note>; and is the due of every father.
Then that he may not seem to speak these things for his own sake,
he shows that it is for their advantage even that he invites this
love from them. And therefore he added,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xiii-p17"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 6.14" id="v.xiii-p17.1" parsed="|2Cor|6|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.6.14">Ver. 14</scripRef>. “Be ye not unequally
yoked together with unbelievers.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xiii-p18">He said not, ‘Intermix not with
unbelievers,’ but rather dealing sharply with<note place="end" n="738" id="v.xiii-p18.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xiii-p19"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xiii-p19.1">καθαπτόμενος</span>.</p></note> them, as transgressing what was
right, ‘Suffer not yourselves to turn aside,’ saith he, “For
what fellowship have righteousness and iniquity?” Here in what
follows he institutes a comparison, not between his own love and
theirs who corrupt them, but between their nobleness and the
others’ dishonor. For thus his discourse became more dignified
and more beseeming himself, and would the rather win them. Just
as if one should say to a son that 
<pb n="344" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_344.html" id="v.xiii-Page_344" />despised his parents, and gave himself up
to vicious persons, ‘What art thou doing, child? Dost thou
despise thy father and prefer impure men filled with ten thousand
vices? Knowest thou not how much better and more respectable thou
art than they?’ For so he detaches him more [readily] from
their society than if he should express admiration of his father.
For were he to say indeed, ‘Knowest thou not how much thy father
is better than they?’ he will not produce so much effect; but if,
leaving mention of his father, he bring himself before them,
saying, ‘Knowest thou not who thou art and what they are? Dost
thou not bear in mind thine own high birth and gentle<note place="end" n="739" id="v.xiii-p19.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xiii-p20"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xiii-p20.1">ἐ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.xiii-p20.2">λευθερίαν</span>.</p></note> blood, and
their infamy? For what communion hast thou with them, those
thieves, those adulterers, those impostors?’ by elevating him
with these praises of himself, he will quickly prepare him to break
off from them. For the former address indeed, he will not
entertain with overmuch acceptance, because the exalting of his
father is an accusation of himself, when he is shown to be not only
grieving a father, but such a father; but in this case he will have
no such feeling. For none would choose not to be praised, and
therefore, along with these praises of him that hears, the rebuke
becometh easy of digestion. For the listener is softened, and is
filled with high thoughts, and disdains<note place="end" n="740" id="v.xiii-p20.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.xiii-p21"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xiii-p21.1">διαπτύει</span>.</p></note> the society of those
persons.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xiii-p22">But not this only is the point to be admired in him
that thus he prosecuted his comparison, but that he imagined
another thing also still greater and more astounding; in the first
place, prosecuting his speech in the form of interrogation, which
is proper to things that are clear and admitted, and then dilating
it by the quick succession and multitude of his terms. For he
employs not one or two or three only, but several. Add to this
that instead of the persons he employs the names of the things, and
he delineates here high virtue and there extreme vice; and shows
the difference between them to be great and infinite so as not even
to need demonstration. “For what fellowship,” saith he,
“have righteousness and iniquity?”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xiii-p23">“And what communion hath light with darkness?”

say those who are of the light, and those who are of the darkness;
but he uses opposites themselves which can not admit of their
opposites, ‘light and darkness.’ Nor said he those who are of
Christ, with those who are of the devil; but, which was far wider
apart, Christ and Beliar, so calling that apostate one, in the
Hebrew tongue. “Or what portion hath a believer with an
unbeliever?” Here, at length, that he may not seem simply to be
going through a censure of vice and an encomium of virtue, he
mentions persons also without particularizing. And he said not,
‘communion,’ but spoke of the rewards, using the term
“portion. What agreement hath a temple of God with
idols?”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xiii-p29">“For ye<note place="end" n="745" id="v.xiii-p29.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xiii-p30"> [The testimony preponderates in favor of the first

God.” Now what he says is this. Neither hath your King aught
in common with him, “for what concord hath Christ with Beliar?”
nor have the things [aught in common], “for what communion hath
light with darkness?” Therefore neither should ye. And first
he mentions their king and then themselves; by this separating them
most effectually. Then having said, “a temple of God with
idols,” and having declared, “For ye are a temple of the living
God,” he is necessitated to subjoin also the testimony of this to
show that the thing is no flattery. For he that praises except he
also exhibit proof, even appears to flatter. What then is his
testimony? For,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xiii-p31">“I will dwell in them,” saith he, “and
walk in them. I will dwell in,” as in temples, “and walk in
them,” signifying the more abundant attachment<note place="end" n="746" id="v.xiii-p31.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xiii-p32"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xiii-p32.1">σχέσιν</span>.</p></note> to them.</p>

‘What?’ saith he, ‘Dost thou bear God within thee, and
runnest unto them? God That hath nothing in common with them? 
And in what can this deserve forgiveness? Bear in mind Who
walketh, Who dwelleth in thee.’</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xiii-p42">Let us neither touch unclean things, for this is

but there needeth something else besides to our becoming holy;
earnestness, heedfulness, piety. And he well said, “In the fear
of God.” For it is possible to perfect chasteness, not in the
fear of God but for vainglory. And along with this he implies yet
another thing, by saying, “In the fear of God;” the manner,
namely, whereafter holiness may be perfected. For if lust be even
an imperious thing, still if thou occupy its territory with<note place="end" n="748" id="v.xiii-p43.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xiii-p44"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xiii-p44.1">ἐ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.xiii-p44.2">πιτειχίσῃς</span>.</p></note> the fear of
God, thou hast stayed its frenzy.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xiii-p45">[4.] Now by holiness here he means not
chastity alone, but the freedom from every kind of sin, for he is
holy that is pure. Now one will become pure, not if he be free

pride<note place="end" n="749" id="v.xiii-p45.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xiii-p46"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xiii-p46.1">ἀ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.xiii-p46.2">πονοίας</span>.</p></note>, and
vainglory, yea especially from vainglory which in every thing
indeed it behoveth to avoid, but much more in almsgiving; since
neither will it be almsgiving, if it have this distemper, but
display and cruelty. For when thou dost it not out of mercy, but
from parade<note place="end" n="750" id="v.xiii-p46.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.xiii-p47"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xiii-p47.1">ἐ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.xiii-p47.2">κπομπεύων</span>.</p></note>, such deed
is not only no alms but even an insult; for thou hast put thy
brother to open shame<note place="end" n="751" id="v.xiii-p47.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.xiii-p48"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xiii-p48.1">παρεδειγμάτισας</span>.</p></note>. Not then the giving money, but
the giving it out of mercy, is almsgiving. For people too at the
theatres give, both to prostitute boys and to others who are on the
stage; but such a deed is not almsgiving. And they too give that
abuse the persons of prostitute women; but this is not
lovingkindness, but insolent treatment<note place="end" n="752" id="v.xiii-p48.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xiii-p49"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xiii-p49.1">παροινία</span>.</p></note>. Like this is the vainglorious
also. For just as he that abuseth the person of the harlot, pays
her a price for that abuse; so too dost thou demand a price of him
that receiveth of thee, thine insult of him and thine investing him
as well as thyself with an evil notoriety. And besides this, the
loss is unspeakable. For just as a wild beast and a mad dog
springing upon us might, so doth this ill disease and this
inhumanity make prey of our good things. For inhumanity and
cruelty such a course is; yea, rather more grievous even than
this. For the cruel indeed would not give to him that asked; but
thou dost more than this; thou hinderest those that wish to give.
For when thou paradest thy giving, thou hast both lowered the
reputation of the receiver, and hast pulled back<note place="end" n="753" id="v.xiii-p49.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xiii-p50"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xiii-p50.1">ἀ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.xiii-p50.2">νεχαίτισας</span>.</p></note> him that was about to give, if he
be of a careless mind. For he will not give to him thenceforth,
on the ground of his having already received, and so not being in
want; yea he will often accuse him even, if after having received
he should draw near to beg, and will think him impudent. What
sort of almsgiving then is this when thou both shamest thyself and
him that receiveth; and also in two ways Him that enjoined it: 
both because while having Him for a spectator of thine alms, thou
seekest the eyes of thy fellow-servants besides Him, and because
thou transgressest the law laid down by Him forbidding these
things.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xiii-p51">I could have wished to carry this out into those
other subjects as well, both fasting and prayer, and to show in how
many respects vainglory is injurious there also; but I remember
that in the discourse before this I left unfinished a certain
necessary point. What was the point? I was saying, that the
poor have the advantage of the rich in the things of this life,
when I discoursed concerning health and pleasure; and this was
shown indistinctly. Come then, to-day let us show this, that not
in the things of this life only, but also in those that are higher,
the advantage is with them. For what leadeth unto a kingdom,
riches or poverty? Let us hear the Lord Himself of the heavens
saying of those, that “it is easier for a camel to go through the
eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of
heaven:” (<scripRef passage="Matt. xix. 24" id="v.xiii-p51.1" parsed="|Matt|19|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.19.24">Matt. xix.
24</scripRef>.) but of the poor the
contrary, “If thou wilt be perfect, sell that thou hast, and give
to the poor; and come, follow Me; and thou shalt have treasure in
heaven.” (<scripRef passage="Matt. xix. 21" id="v.xiii-p51.2" parsed="|Matt|19|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.19.21">Matt. xix.
21</scripRef>.) But if ye will,
let us see what is said on either side. “Narrow and straitened
is the way,” He saith, “that leadeth unto life.” (<scripRef passage="Matt. vii. 14" id="v.xiii-p51.3" parsed="|Matt|7|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.7.14">Matt. vii. 14</scripRef>.) Who then treadeth
the narrow way, he that is in luxury, or that is in poverty; that
is independent, or that carrieth ten thousand burdens; the lax<note place="end" n="754" id="v.xiii-p51.4"><p class="endnote" id="v.xiii-p52"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xiii-p52.1">χαῦνος</span>.</p></note> and
dissolute, or the thoughtful and anxious? <pb n="346" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_346.html" id="v.xiii-Page_346" />But what need of these arguments,
when it is best to betake one’s self to the persons themselves.
Lazarus was poor, yea very poor; and he that passed him by as he
lay at his gateway was rich. Which then entered into the kingdom,
and was in delights in Abraham’s bosom? and which of them was
scorched, with not even a drop at his command? But, saith one,
‘both many poor will be lost, and [many] rich will enjoy those
unspeakable goods.’ Nay rather, one may see the contrary, few
rich saved, but of the poor far more. For, consider, making
accurate measure of the hindrances of riches and the defects of
poverty, (or rather, neither of riches nor of poverty are they, but
each of those who have riches or poverty; howbeit,) let us at least
see which is the more available weapon. What defect then doth
poverty seem to possess? Lying. And what, wealth? Pride, the
mother of evils; which also made the devil a devil, who was not
such before. Again, “the love of money is a root of all kinds
of evil.” (<scripRef passage="1 Tim. vi. 10" id="v.xiii-p52.2" parsed="|1Tim|6|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.6.10">1 Tim. vi.
10</scripRef>.) Which then
stands near this root, the rich man, or the poor? Is it not very
plainly the rich? For the more things anyone surrounds himself
with, he desires so much the more. Vainglory again damages tens
of thousands of good deeds, and near this too again the rich man
hath his dwelling<note place="end" n="755" id="v.xiii-p52.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.xiii-p53"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xiii-p53.1">ἐ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.xiii-p53.2">σκήνωται</span>.</p></note>.
“But,” saith one, “thou mentionest not the [evils] of the
poor man, his affliction, his straits.” Nay, but this is both
common to the rich, and is his more than the poor man’s; so that
those indeed which appear to be evils of poverty are common to
either: whilst those of riches are riches’ only. ‘But
what,’ saith one, ‘when for want of necessaries the poor man
committeth many horrible things?’ But no poor man, no, not one,
committeth as many horrible things from want, as do the rich for
the sake of surrounding themselves with more, and of not losing
what stores they have<note place="end" n="756" id="v.xiii-p53.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.xiii-p54"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xiii-p54.1">τὰ ἔνδον</span>.</p></note>. For the poor man doth not so
eagerly desire necessaries as the rich doth superfluities; nor
again has he as much strength to put wickedness in practice as the
other hath power. If then the rich man is both more willing and
able, it is quite plain that he will rather commit such, and more
of them. Nor is the poor man so much afraid in respect of hunger,
as the rich trembleth and is anxious in respect of the loss of what
he has, and because he has not yet gotten all men’s
possessions. Since then he is near both vainglory and arrogance,
and the love of money, the root of all evils, what hope of
salvation shall he have except he display much wisdom? And how
shall he walk the narrow way? Let us not therefore carry about
the notions of the many, but examine into the facts. For how is
it not absurd that in respect to money, indeed, we do not trust to
others, but refer this to figures and calculation; but in
calculating upon facts we are lightly drawn aside by the notions of
others; and that too, though we possess an exact balance<note place="end" n="757" id="v.xiii-p54.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xiii-p55"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xiii-p55.1">ζυγόν</span>.</p></note>, and

things, the declaration of the divine laws? Wherefore I exhort
and entreat you all, disregard what this man and that man thinks
about these things, and inquire from the Scriptures all these
things; and having learnt what are the true riches, let us pursue
after them that we may obtain also the eternal good things; which
may we all obtain, through the grace and love towards men of our
Lord Jesus Christ, with Whom, to the Father and the Holy Spirit, be
glory, might, and honor, now and ever, and world without end.

<p class="c24" id="v.xiv-p5"><span class="c18" id="v.xiv-p5.1">Again</span> he raiseth the
discourse about love, mitigating the harshness of his rebuke. For
since he had convicted and reproached them as being beloved indeed,
yet not loving in an equal degree, but breaking away from his love
and mixing up with other pestilent fellows; again he softens the
vehemence of his rebuke, saying, “Make room for us,” that is,
“love us;” and prays to receive a favor involving no burden,
and advantaging them that confer above them that receive it. And
he said not, ‘love,’ but with a stronger appeal to their <pb n="347" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_347.html" id="v.xiv-Page_347" />pity<note place="end" n="761" id="v.xiv-p5.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xiv-p6"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xiv-p6.1">ἐ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.xiv-p6.2">λεεινότερον</span>.</p></note>, “make room for.” ‘Who
expelled us?’ saith he: ‘Who cast us out of your hearts? 
How come we to be straitened in you?’ for since he said above,
“Ye are straitened in your affections;” here declaring it more
clearly, he said, “make room for us:” in this way also again
winning them to himself. For nothing doth so produce love as for
the beloved to know that he that loveth him exceedingly desireth
his love.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xiv-p7">“We wronged no man.” See how again he
does not mention the benefits [done by him], but frameth his speech
in another way, so as to be both less offensive and more cutting<note place="end" n="762" id="v.xiv-p7.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xiv-p8"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xiv-p8.1">πληκτικώτερον</span>.</p></note>. And at
the same time he also alludes to the false apostles, saying, “We
wronged no man, we corrupted no man, we defrauded no
man.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xiv-p9">What is “we corrupted?” That is, we beguiled
no man; as he says elsewhere also. “Lest by any means, as the
serpent beguiled Eve, so your minds should be corrupted.”
(<scripRef passage="2 Cor. xi. 3" id="v.xiv-p9.1" parsed="|2Cor|11|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.11.3">2 Cor. xi. 3</scripRef>.)</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xiv-p10">“We defrauded no man;” we plundered, plotted
against no man. And he for the present forbears to say, ‘we
benefited you in such and such ways;’ but framing his language so
as more to shame them, “We wronged no man,” he says; as much as
saying, ‘Even had we in no wise benefited you, not even so ought
ye to turn away from us; for ye have nothing to lay to our charge,
either small or great.’ Then, for he felt the heaviness of his
rebuke, he tempers it again. And he was neither silent
altogether, for so he would not have aroused them; nor yet did he
let the harshness of his language go unmodified, for so he would
have wounded them too much. And what says he?</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xiv-p11"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 7.3" id="v.xiv-p11.1" parsed="|2Cor|7|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.7.3">Ver. 3</scripRef>.
“I say it not to condemn you.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xiv-p12">How is this evident? “For I have said before,”
he adds, “that ye are in our hearts to die and live with
you.” This is the greatest affection, when even though treated
with contempt, he chooseth both to die and live with them. ‘For
neither are ye merely in our hearts,’ he says, ‘but in such
sort as I said. For it is possible both to love and to shun
dangers, but we do not thus.’ And behold here also wisdom
unspeakable. For he spake not of what had been done for them,
that he might not seem to be again reproaching them, but he
promiseth for the future. ‘For should it chance,’ saith he,
‘that danger should invade, for your sakes I am ready to suffer
every thing; and neither death nor life seemeth aught to me in
itself, but in whichever ye be, that is to me more desirable, both
death than life and life than death.’ Howbeit, dying indeed is
manifestly a proof of love; but living, who is there that would not
choose, even of those who are not friends? Why then does the
Apostle mention it as something great? Because it is even
exceeding great. For numbers indeed sympathize with their friends
when they are in misfortune, but when they are in honor rejoice not
with, but envy, them. ‘But not so we; but whether ye be in
calamity, we are not afraid to share your ill fortune; or whether
ye be prosperous, we are not wounded with envy.’</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xiv-p13">[2.] Then after he had continually repeated these
things, saying, “Ye are not straitened in us;” and, “Ye are
straitened in your own affections;” and, “make room for us;”
and, “Be ye also enlarged;” and, “We wronged no man;” and
all these things seemed to be a condemnation of them: observe how
he also in another manner alleviates this severity by saying,
“Great is my boldness of speech towards you.” ‘Therefore I
venture upon such things,’ he says, ‘not to condemn you by what
I say, but out of my great boldness of speech,’ which also
farther signifying, he said, “Great is my glorying on your
behalf.” ‘For think not indeed,’ he saith, ‘that because
I thus speak, I speak as though I had condemned you altogether;
(for I am exceedingly proud of, and glory in, you;) but both out of
tender concern and a desire that you should make greater increase
unto virtue.’ And so he said to the Hebrews also after much
rebuke; “But we are persuaded better things of you, and things
that accompany salvation, though we thus speak: and we desire
that each one of you may show the same diligence to the fullness of
hope even to the end.” (<scripRef passage="Heb. vi. 9, 11" id="v.xiv-p13.1" parsed="|Heb|6|9|0|0;|Heb|6|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Heb.6.9 Bible:Heb.6.11">Heb. vi. 9, 11</scripRef>.) So indeed here also,
“Great is my glorying on your behalf.” ‘We glory to others
of you,’ he says. Seest thou what genuine comfort he has
given? ‘And,’ he saith, ‘I do not simply glory, but also,
greatly.’ Accordingly he added these words; “I am filled with
comfort.” What comfort? ‘That coming from you; because that
ye, having been reformed, comforted me by your conduct.’ This
is the test of one that loveth, both to complain of not being loved
and to fear lest he should inflict pain by complaining
immoderately. Therefore he says, “I am filled with comfort, I
overflow with joy.” ‘But these expressions,’ saith one,
‘seem to contradict the former.’ They do not do so, however,
but are even exceedingly in harmony with them. For these procure
for the former a favorable reception; and the praise which they
convey makes the benefit of those rebukes more genuine, by quietly
abstracting what was painful in them. Wherefore he uses these
expressions, but with great genuineness and earnestness<note place="end" n="763" id="v.xiv-p13.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xiv-p14"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xiv-p14.1">φιλοτίμως</span>.</p></note>. For he
did <pb n="348" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_348.html" id="v.xiv-Page_348" />not say, ‘I am
filled with joy;’ but, “I abound;” or rather, not
“abound” either, but “superabound;” in this way also again
showing his yearning, that even though he be so loved as to rejoice
and exult, he does not yet think himself loved as he ought to be
loved, nor to have received full payment; so insatiable was he out
of his exceeding love of them. For the joy it brings to be loved
in any degree by those one passionately loves, is great by reason
of our loving them exceedingly. So that this again was a proof of
his affection. And of the comfort indeed, he saith, “I am
filled;” ‘I have received what was owing to me;’ but of the
joy, “I superabound;” that is, ‘I was desponding about you;
but ye have sufficiently excused yourselves and supplied comfort: 
for ye have not only removed the ground of my sorrow, but have even
increased joy.’ Then showing its greatness, he not only
declares it by saying, “I superabound in joy,” but also by
adding, “in all our affliction.” ‘For so great was the
delight arising to us on your account that it was not even dimmed
by so great tribulation, but through the excess of its own
greatness it overcame the sorrows that had hold of us, and suffered
us not to feel the sense of them.’</p>

“For even when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no
relief.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xiv-p16">For since he said, “our tribulation;” he
both explains of what sort it was, and magnifies it by his words,
in order to show that the consolation and joys received from them<note place="end" n="764" id="v.xiv-p16.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xiv-p17"> i.e., the Corinthians.</p></note> was great,
seeing it had repelled so great a sorrow. “But we were
afflicted on every side.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xiv-p18">How on every side? for “without were fightings,”
from the unbelievers; “within were fears;” because of the weak
among the believers, lest they should be drawn aside. For not
amongst the Corinthians only did these things happen, but elsewhere
also.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xiv-p19"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 7.6" id="v.xiv-p19.1" parsed="|2Cor|7|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.7.6">Ver. 6</scripRef>. “Nevertheless He

C.]</p></note> the coming of Titus.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xiv-p21">For since he had testified great things of
them in what he said, that he may not seem to be flattering them he
cites as witness Titus the brother<note place="end" n="766" id="v.xiv-p21.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xiv-p22"> Or ‘his brother.’</p></note>, who had come from them to Paul
after the first Epistle to declare unto him the particulars of
their amendment. But consider, I pray you, how in every place he
maketh a great matter of the coming of Titus. For he saith also
before, “Furthermore when I came to Troas for the Gospel, I had
no relief for my spirit because I found not Titus my brother;”
(c. <scripRef passage="2 Cor. 2.12,13" id="v.xiv-p22.1" parsed="|2Cor|2|12|2|13" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.2.12-2Cor.2.13">ii. 12, 13</scripRef>.) and in this place
again “we were comforted,” he saith, “by the coming of
Titus.” For he is desirous also of establishing the man in
their confidence and of making him exceedingly dear to them. And
observe how he provides for both these things. For by saying on
the one hand, “I had no relief for my spirit,” he showeth the
greatness of his virtue; and by saying on the other, that, in our
tribulation his coming sufficed unto comfort; yet “not by his
coming only, but also by the comfort wherewith he was comforted in
you,” he endeareth<note place="end" n="767" id="v.xiv-p22.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xiv-p23"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xiv-p23.1">οἰκειοῖ</span>.</p></note> the man unto the Corinthians. For
nothing doth so produce and cement friendships as the saying
something sound and favorable of any one. And such he testifies
Titus did; when he says that ‘by his coming he hath given us
wings with pleasure; such things did he report of you. On this
ground his coming made us glad. For we were delighted not “only
by his coming, but also for the comfort wherewith he was comforted
in you.” And how was he comforted? By your virtue, by your
good deeds.’ Wherefore also he adds,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xiv-p24">“While he told us your longing, your mourning,
your zeal for me.” ‘These things made him glad,’ he says,
‘these things comforted him.’ Seest thou how he shows that he
also is an earnest lover of theirs, seeing he considers their good
report as a consolation to himself; and when he was come, gloried,
as though on account of his own good things, unto Paul.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xiv-p25">And observe with what warmth of expression he
reporteth these things, “Your longing, your mourning, your
zeal.” For it was likely<note place="end" n="768" id="v.xiv-p25.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xiv-p26"> Or ‘natural.’</p></note> that they would mourn and grieve
why the blessed Paul was so much displeased, why he had kept away
from them so long. And therefore he did not say simply tears, but
“mourning;” nor desire, but “longing;” nor anger, but
“zeal;” and again “zeal toward him,” which they displayed
both about him that had committed fornication and about those who
were accusing him. ‘For,’ saith he, ‘ye were inflamed and
blazed out on receiving my letters.’ On these accounts he
abounds in joy, on these accounts he is filled with consolation,
because he made them feel. It seems to me, however, that these
things are said not only to soften what has gone before, but also
in encouragement of those who had acted in these things
virtuously. For although I suppose that some were obnoxious to
those former accusations and unworthy of these praises;
nevertheless, he doth not distinguish them, but makes both the
praises and the accusations common, leaving it to the conscience of
his hearers to select that which belongs to them. For so both the
one would be void of offence, and the other lead them on to much
fervor of mind.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xiv-p27"><pb n="349" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_349.html" id="v.xiv-Page_349" />[4.] Such also
now should be the feelings of those who are reprehended; thus
should they lament and mourn; thus yearn after their teachers;
thus, more than fathers, seek them. For by those indeed living
cometh, but by these good living. Thus ought they to bear the
rebukes of their fathers, thus to sympathize with their rulers on
account of those that sin. For it does not rest all with them,
but with you also.  For if he that hath sinned perceives that he
was rebuked indeed by his father, but flattered by his brethren; he
becometh more easy of mind. But when the father rebukes, be thou
too angry as well, whether as concerned for thy brother or as
joining in thy father’s indignation; only be the earnestness thou
showest great; and mourn, not that he was rebuked, but that he
sinned. But if I build up and thou pull down, what profit have we
had but labor? (<scripRef passage="Ecclesiasticus 34.23" id="v.xiv-p27.1" parsed="|Sir|34|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Sir.34.23">Ecclus. xxxiv. 23</scripRef>.) Yea, rather, thy
loss stops not here, but thou bringest also punishment on
thyself. For he that hindereth the wound from being healed is
punished not less than he that inflicted it, but even more. For
it is not an equal offence to wound and to hinder that which is
wounded from being healed; for this indeed necessarily gendereth
death, but that not necessarily. Now I have spoken thus to you;
that ye may join in the anger of your rulers whenever they are
indignant justly; that when ye see any one rebuked, ye may all shun
him more than does the teacher. Let him that hath offended fear
you more than his rulers. For if he is afraid of his teacher
only, he will readily sin: but if he have to dread so many eyes,
so many tongues, he will be in greater safety. For as, if we do
not thus act, we shall suffer the extremest punishment; so, if we
perform these things, we shall partake of the gain that accrues
from his reformation. Thus then let us act; and if any one shall
say, ‘be humane towards thy brother, this is a Christian’s
duty;’ let him be taught, that he is humane who is angry [with
him], not he who sets him at ease<note place="end" n="769" id="v.xiv-p27.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xiv-p28"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xiv-p28.1">χαλῶν</span> Field. The

even to come to a sense of his transgression. For which, tell me,
pities the man in a fever and laboring under delirium, he that lays
him on his bed, and binds him down, and keeps him from meats and
drinks that are not fit for him; or he that allows him to glut
himself with strong drink, and orders him to have his liberty, and
to act in every respect as one that is in health? Does not this
person even aggravate the distemper, the man that seemeth to act
humanely, whereas the other amends it? Such truly ought our
decision to be in this case also. For it is the part of humanity,
not to humor the sick in every thing nor to flatter their
unseasonable desires. No one so loved him that committed
fornication amongst the Corinthians, as Paul who commandeth to
deliver him to Satan; no one so hated him as they that applaud and
court him; and the event showed it. For they indeed both puffed
him up and increased his inflammation; but [the Apostle] both
lowered it and left him not until he brought him to perfect
health. And they indeed added to the existing mischief, he
eradicated even that which existed from the first. These laws,
then, of humanity let us learn also. For if thou seest a horse
hurrying down a precipice, thou appliest a bit and holdest him in
with violence and lashest him frequently; although this is
punishment, yet the punishment itself is the mother of safety.
Thus act also in the case of those that sin. Bind him that hath
transgressed until he have appeased God; let him not go loose, that
he be not bound the faster by the anger of God. If I bind, God
doth not chain; if I bind not, the indissoluble chains await him.
“For if we judged ourselves, we should not be judged.
(<scripRef passage="1 Cor. xi. 31" id="v.xiv-p28.7" parsed="|1Cor|11|31|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.11.31">1 Cor. xi. 31</scripRef>.) Think not, then, that thus
to act cometh of cruelty and inhumanity; nay, but of the highest
gentleness and the most skillful leechcraft and of much tender
care. But, saith one, they have been punished for a long time.
How long? Tell me. A year, and two, and three years? Howbeit,
I require not this, length of time, but amendment of soul. This
then show, whether they have been pricked to the heart, whether
they have reformed, and all is done: since if there be not this,
there is no advantage in the time. For neither do we inquire
whether the wound has been often bandaged, but whether the bandage
has been of any service. If therefore it hath been of service,
although in a short time, let it be kept on no longer: but if it
hath done no service, even at the end of ten years, let it be still
kept on: and let this fix the term of release, the good of him
that is bound. If we are thus careful both of ourselves and of
others, and regard not honor and dishonor at the hands of men; but
bearing in mind the punishment and the disgrace that is there, and
above all the provoking of God, apply with energy the medicines of
repentance: we shall both presently arrive at the perfect health,
and shall obtain the good things to come; which may all we obtain,
through the grace and love towards men of our Lord Jesus Christ,
with Whom, to the Father, with the Holy Spirit, be glory, might,
honor, now and ever, and world without end. Amen.</p>

shows the advantage of the thing. For he did this indeed even
before, when he said, “For out of much affliction and anguish of
heart, I wrote unto you: not that ye should be made sorry, but
that ye might know the love which I have toward you.”
(c. <scripRef passage="2 Cor. 2.4" id="v.xv-p6.2" parsed="|2Cor|2|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.2.4">ii. 4</scripRef>.) And he does it also
now, establishing this same point in more words. And he said not,
‘I regretted indeed before, but now I do not regret:’ but
how? “I regret not now, though I did regret.” ‘Even if
what I wrote,’ he says, ‘was such as to overstep the [due]
measure of rebuke<note place="end" n="772" id="v.xv-p6.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.xv-p7"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xv-p7.1">τό μετρόν τῆς
ἐπιτιμήσεως</span>.</p></note>, and to
cause me to regret; still the great advantage which has accrued
from them doth not allow me to regret.’ And this he said, not
as though he had rebuked them beyond due measure, but to heighten
his praises of them. ‘For the amendment ye manifested was so
great,’ saith he, ‘that even if I did happen to smite you too
severely insomuch that I even condemned myself, I praise myself now
from the result.’ Just as with little children, when they have
undergone a painful remedy, such as an incision, or cautery, or
bitter physic, afterwards we are not afraid to sooth them; so also
doth Paul.</p>

epistle made you sorry, though but for a season. Now I rejoice
not that ye were made sorry, but that ye were made sorry unto
repentance.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xv-p9">Having said, “I do not regret,” he tells the
reason also; alleging the good that resulted from his letter; and
skillfully excusing himself by saying, “though but for a
season.” For truly that which was painful was brief, but that
which was profitable was perpetual. And what indeed followed
naturally was to say, ‘even though it grieved you for a season,
yet it made you glad and benefited you forever.’ But he doth
not say this: but before mentioning the gain he passes again to
his praises of them, and the proof of his own concern for them,
saying, “Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry,” (‘for
what gain came to me from you being made sorry?) “but that ye
were made sorry unto repentance,” that the sorrow brought some
gain.’ For a father also when he sees his son under the knife
rejoiceth not that he is being pained, but that he is being cured;
so also doth this man. But observe how he transfers all that was
well achieved in the matter unto themselves; and lays whatever was
painful to the account of the Epistle, saying, “It made you sorry
for a season;” whilst the benefit that resulted from it he speaks
of as their own good achieving. For he said not, ‘The Epistle
corrected you,’ although this was the case; but, “ye sorrowed
unto repentance.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xv-p10">“For ye were made sorry after a godly sort, that
ye might suffer loss by us in nothing.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xv-p11">Seest thou wisdom unspeakable? ‘For had we
not done this,’ he says, ‘we had done you damage.’ And he
affirms that indeed which was well achieved to be theirs, but the
damage his own, if indeed he had been silent. For if they are
likely to be corrected by a sharp rebuke, then, if we did not
sharply rebuke, we should have done you damage; and the injury
would not be with you alone, but also with us. For just as he

<p class="c19" id="v.xv-p13">[2.] <scripRef passage="2 Cor. 7.10" id="v.xv-p13.1" parsed="|2Cor|7|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.7.10">Ver. 10</scripRef>. “For godly sorrow worketh
repentance unto salvation, a repentance which bringeth no
regret.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xv-p14">‘Therefore,’ he says, ‘though I did regret
before I saw the fruit and the gain, how great they were I do not
regret now .’ For such a thing is godly sorrow. And then he
philosophizeth about it, showing that sorrow is not in all cases a
grievous thing, but when it is worldly. And what is worldly? If
thou be in sorrow for 
<pb n="351" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_351.html" id="v.xv-Page_351" />money, for reputation, for him that is
departed, all these are worldly. Wherefore also they work
death. For he that is in sorrow for reputation’s sake feeleth
envy and is driven oftentimes to perish: such sorrow was that
which Cain sorrowed, such Esau. By this worldly sorrow then he
meaneth that which is to the harm of those that sorrow. For only
in respect to sins is sorrow a profitable thing; as is evident in
this way. He that sorroweth for loss of wealth repaireth not that
damage; he that sorroweth for one deceased raiseth not the dead to
life again; he that sorroweth for a sickness, not only is not made
well but even aggravates the disease: he that sorroweth for sins,
he alone attains some advantage from his sorrow, for he maketh his
sins wane and disappear. For since the medicine has been prepared
for this thing, in this case only is it potent and displays its
profitableness; and in the other cases is even injurious. ‘And
yet Cain,’ saith one, ‘sorrowed because he was not accepted
with God.’ It was not for this, but because he saw his brother
glorious in honor<note place="end" n="774" id="v.xv-p14.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xv-p15"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xv-p15.1">λάμποντα</span>.</p></note>; for had he
grieved for this, it behoved him to emulate and rejoice with him;
but, as it was, grieving, he showed that his was a worldly
sorrow. But not so did David, nor Peter, nor any of the
righteous. Wherefore they were accepted, when grieving either
over their own sins or those of others. And yet what is more
oppressive than sorrow? Still when it is after a godly sort, it
is better than the joy in the world. For this indeed ends in
nothing; but that “worketh repentance unto salvation, a salvation
that bringeth no regret.” For what is admirable in it is this
that one who had thus sorrowed would never repent, whilst this is
an especial characteristic of worldly sorrow. For what is more
regretted than a true born son? And what is a heavier grief than
a death of this sort? But yet those fathers who in the height of
their grief endure nobody and who wildly beat themselves, after a
time repent because they have grieved immoderately; as having
thereby nothing benefitted themselves, but even added to their
affliction. But not such as this is godly sorrow; but it
possesseth two advantages, that of not being condemned in that a
man grieves for, and that this sorrow endeth in salvation; of both
which that is deprived. For they both sorrow unto harm and after
they have sorrowed vehemently condemn themselves, bringing forth
this greatest token of having done it unto harm. But godly sorrow
is the reverse [of this]: wherefore also he said, “worketh
repentance unto salvation, a repentance that bringeth no
regret.” For no one will condemn himself if he have sorrowed
for sin, if he have mourned and afflicted himself. Which also
when the blessed Paul hath said he needeth not to adduce from other
sources the proof of what he said, nor to bring forward those in
the old histories who sorrowed, but he adduceth the Corinthians
themselves; and furnishes his proof from what they had done; that
along with praises he might both instruct them and the rather win
them to himself.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xv-p16"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 7.11" id="v.xv-p16.1" parsed="|2Cor|7|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.7.11">Ver. 11</scripRef>. “For behold,” he saith,
“this self-same thing, that ye were made sorry after a godly
sort, what earnest care it wrought in you.” ‘For not only,’
he saith, ‘did your sorrow not cast you into that condemning of
yourselves, as having acted idly in so doing; but it made you even
more careful.’ Then he speaks of the certain tokens of that
carefulness;</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xv-p17">“Yea,” what “clearing of yourselves,”
towards me. “Yea, what indignation” against him that had
sinned. “Yea, what fear.” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. 7.11" id="v.xv-p17.1" parsed="|2Cor|7|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.7.11">ver. 11</scripRef>.) For so great carefulness
and very speedy reformation was the part of men who feared
exceedingly. And that he might not seem to be exalting himself,
see how quickly he softened it by saying,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xv-p18">“Yea, what longing,” that towards me. “Yea,
what zeal,” that on God’s behalf. “Yea, what avenging:”
for ye also avenged the laws of God that had been outraged.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xv-p19">“In every thing ye approved yourselves to be
pure in the matter.” Not only by not having perpetrated, for
this was evident before, but also by not consenting<note place="end" n="775" id="v.xv-p19.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xv-p20"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xv-p20.1">συνήδεσθαι</span>.</p></note> unto it.
For since he said in the former Epistle, “and ye are puffed
up;” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. v. 2" id="v.xv-p20.2" parsed="|1Cor|5|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.5.2">1 Cor. v.

‘ye have cleared yourselves of this suspicion also; not only by
not praising, but also by rebuking and being indignant.’</p>

wrote unto you,” I wrote “not for his cause that did the wrong,
nor for his cause that suffered the wrong.” For that they might
not say, Why then dost thou rebuke us if we were “clear in the
matter?” setting himself to meet this even further above, and
disposing of it beforehand<note place="end" n="776" id="v.xv-p21.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xv-p22"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xv-p22.1">προδιοικούμενος</span>.</p></note>, he said what he said, namely, “I
do not regret, though I did regret.” ‘For so far,’ says he,
‘am I from repenting now of what I wrote then, that I repented
then more than I do now when ye have approved<note place="end" n="777" id="v.xv-p22.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xv-p23"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xv-p23.1">συνεστήσατε</span>.</p></note> yourselves.’ Seest thou again
his vehemence and earnest contention, how he has turned around what
was said unto the very opposite. For what they thought would have
made him recant<note place="end" n="778" id="v.xv-p23.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xv-p24"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xv-p24.1">διατετράφθαι</span>.</p></note> in confusion
as having rebuked them hastily, by reason of their amendment; that
he uses as a proof that it was right in him to speak freely. For
neither does he refuse afterwards to humor them fearlessly,
when <pb n="352" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_352.html" id="v.xv-Page_352" />he finds he can do
this. For he that said farther above such things as these, “He
that is joined to an harlot is one body,” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. vi. 16" id="v.xv-p24.2" parsed="|1Cor|6|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.6.16">1 Cor. vi. 16</scripRef>.) and, “Deliver such an one
to Satan for the destruction of the flesh,” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. v. 5" id="v.xv-p24.3" parsed="|1Cor|5|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.5.5">1 Cor. v. 5</scripRef>.) and, “Every sin that a man
doeth is without the body,” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. vi. 18" id="v.xv-p24.4" parsed="|1Cor|6|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.6.18">1 Cor. vi. 18</scripRef>.) and such like things;
how saith he here, “Not for his cause that did the wrong, nor for
his cause that suffered the wrong?” Not contradicting, but
being even exceedingly consistent with himself. How consistent
with himself? Because it was a very great point with him to show
the affection he bore towards them. He does not therefore discard
concern for him<note place="end" n="779" id="v.xv-p24.5"><p class="endnote" id="v.xv-p25"> i.e. the incestuous person.</p></note>, but shows
at the same time, as I said, the love he had for them, and that a
greater fear agitated him, [namely] for the whole Church. For he
had feared lest the evil should eat further, and advancing on its
way should seize upon the whole Church. Wherefore also he said,
“A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. v. 6" id="v.xv-p25.1" parsed="|1Cor|5|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.5.6">1 Cor. v. 6</scripRef>.) This however he said at
the time; but now that they had well done, he no longer puts it so
but differently: and implies indeed the same thing, but manages
his expressions more agreeably, saying,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xv-p26">“That our care for you might appear unto
you.<note place="end" n="780" id="v.xv-p26.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xv-p27"> [The true text of this clause is given in the Rev.
Vers. “That your earnest care for us might be made
manifest.” C.]</p></note>”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xv-p28">That is, ‘that ye might know how I love you.’
Now this is the same thing as the former, but being differently
expressed seemed to convey another meaning. For [to convince
thyself] that it is the same, unfold his conception and thou wilt
perceive the difference to be nothing. ‘For because I love you
exceedingly,’ saith he, ‘I was afraid lest ye should suffer any
injury from that quarter, and yourselves succeed to that
sorrow.’ As therefore when he says, “Doth God take care for
oxen?” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. ix. 9" id="v.xv-p28.1" parsed="|1Cor|9|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.9.9">1 Cor. ix.
9</scripRef>.) he doth not mean that
He careth not, (for it is not possible for any existing thing to
consist if deserted by the Providence of God:)  but that He did
not legislate primarily for oxen, so also here he means to say,
‘I wrote first indeed on your account, but secondly on his
also. And I had indeed that love in myself,’ he says, ‘even
independently of mine Epistle: but I was desirous of showing it
both to you, and in a word to all, by that writing.’</p>

comforted.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xv-p32">[4.] For nothing doth so declare him that beareth
rule as paternal affection for the ruled. For begetting alone
constitutes not a father; but after begetting, also loving. But
if where nature is concerned there is so great need of love, much
more where grace is concerned. In this way were all the ancients
distinguished. As many, for instance, as obtained a good report
amongst the Hebrews, by this were made manifest. So was Samuel
shown to be great, saying, “But God forbid that I should sin
against God in ceasing to pray for you:” (<scripRef passage="1 Sam. xii. 23" id="v.xv-p32.1" parsed="|1Sam|12|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Sam.12.23">1 Sam. xii. 23</scripRef>.) so was David, so Abraham, so
Elijah, and so each one of the righteous, those in the New
Testament and those in the Old. For so Moses for the sake of
those he ruled left so great riches and treasures untold,
“choosing to suffer affliction with the people of God,” (<scripRef passage="Heb. xi. 25" id="v.xv-p32.2" parsed="|Heb|11|25|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Heb.11.25">Heb. xi. 25</scripRef>.) and before his
appointment was leader of the people<note place="end" n="782" id="v.xv-p32.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.xv-p33"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xv-p33.1">δημαγωγὸς</span>.</p></note> by his actions. Wherefore also
very foolishly did that Hebrew say to him, “Who made thee a ruler
and a judge over us?” (<scripRef passage="Exod. ii. 14" id="v.xv-p33.2" parsed="|Exod|2|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Exod.2.14">Exod. ii. 14</scripRef>.) What sayest thou? 
Thou seest the actions and doubtest of the title? Just as if one
seeing a physician using the knife excellently well, and succoring
that limb in the body which was diseased, should say, ‘Who made
thee a physician and ordered thee to use the knife?’ ‘Art, my
good Sir<note place="end" n="783" id="v.xv-p33.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.xv-p34"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xv-p34.1">ὦ  βέλτιστε</span>.</p></note>, and thine
own ailment.’ So too did his knowledge make him (i.e., Moses,)
what he claimed to be. For ruling is an art, not merely a
dignity, and an art above all arts. For if the rule of those
without is an art and science superior to all other, much more
this. For this rule is as much better than that, as that than the
rest; yea, rather, even much more. And, if ye will, let us
examine this argument more accurately. There is an art of
agriculture, of weaving, of building; which are both very necessary
and tend greatly to preserve our life. For others surely are but
ancillary to these; the coppersmith’s, the carpenter’s, the
shepherd’s. But further, of arts themselves the most necessary
of all is the agricultural, which was even that which God first
introduced when He had formed man. For without shoes and clothes
it is possible to live; but without agriculture it is impossible.
And such they say are the Hamaxobii, the Nomads amongst the
Scythians, and the Indian Gymnosophists. For these troubled not
themselves<note place="end" n="784" id="v.xv-p34.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xv-p35"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xv-p35.1">εἴασαν</span>.</p></note> with the
arts of housebuilding, and weaving, and shoemaking, but
<pb n="353" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_353.html" id="v.xv-Page_353" />need only that of
agriculture. Blush ye that have need of those arts that be
superfluous, cooks, confectioners, embroiderers, and ten thousand
other such people, that ye may live; blush ye that introduce vain
refinements<note place="end" n="785" id="v.xv-p35.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xv-p36"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xv-p36.1">ματαιοτεχνίας</span>.</p></note> into life;
blush ye who are unbelievers, before those barbarians who have no
need of art. For God made nature exceedingly independent, needing
only a few things<note place="end" n="786" id="v.xv-p36.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xv-p37"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xv-p37.1">ἐξ
ὀλίγων</span>.</p></note>. However,
I do not compel you nor lay it down for law that ye should live
thus; but as Jacob asked. And what did he ask? “If the Lord
will give me bread to eat and raiment to put on.” (<scripRef passage="Gen. xxviii. 20" id="v.xv-p37.2" parsed="|Gen|28|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.28.20">Gen. xxviii. 20</scripRef>.) So also Paul commanded,
saying, “And having food and covering let us be therewith
content.” (<scripRef passage="1 Tim. vi. 8" id="v.xv-p37.3" parsed="|1Tim|6|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.6.8">1 Tim. vi.
8</scripRef>.) First then
comes agriculture; second, weaving; and third after it, building;
and shoemaking last of all; for amongst us at any rate there are
many both servants and laborers who live without shoes. These,
therefore, are the useful and necessary arts. Come, then, let us
compare them with that of ruling. For I have therefore brought
forward these that are of all most important, that when it shall
have been seen to be superior to them, its victory over the rest
may be unquestioned. Whereby then shall we show that it is more
necessary than all? Because without it there is no advantage in
these. And if you think good, let us leave mention of the rest
and bring on the stage<note place="end" n="787" id="v.xv-p37.4"><p class="endnote" id="v.xv-p38"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xv-p38.1">εἰς μέσον</span>.</p></note> that one which stands higher and is
more important than any, that of agriculture. Where then will be
the advantage of the many hands of your laborers, if they are at
war with one another and plunder one another’s goods? For, as
it is, the fear of the ruler restrains them and protects that which
is wrought by them; but if thou take this away, in vain is their
labor. But if one examine accurately, he will find yet another
rule which is the parent and bond of this. What then may this
be? That according to which it behoveth each man to control and
rule himself, chastising his unworthy passions, but both nourishing
and promoting the growth of all the germs of virtue with all
care.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xv-p39">For there are [these] species of rule; one, that
whereby men rule peoples and states, regulating this the political
life; which Paul denoting said, “Let every soul be subject to the
higher powers; for there is no power but of God.” (<scripRef passage="Rom. xiii. 1, 4" id="v.xv-p39.1" parsed="|Rom|13|1|0|0;|Rom|13|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.13.1 Bible:Rom.13.4">Rom. xiii. 1, 4</scripRef>.) Afterwards to show the
advantage of this, he went on to say, that the ruler “is a
minister of God for good;” and again, “he is a minister of God,
and avenger to execute wrath on him that doeth evil.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xv-p40">A second there is whereby every one that hath
understanding ruleth himself; and this also the Apostle further
denoted<note place="end" n="788" id="v.xv-p40.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xv-p41"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xv-p41.1">παρεδήλωσεν</span>.</p></note>, saying,
“Wouldest thou have no fear of the power? do that which is
good;” (<scripRef passage="Rom. xii. 3" id="v.xv-p41.2" parsed="|Rom|12|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.12.3">Rom. xii.
3</scripRef>.) speaking of him that ruleth himself.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xv-p42">[5.] Here, however, there is yet another rule,
higher than the political rule. And what is this? That in the
Church. And this also itself Paul mentions, saying, “Obey them
that have the rule over you and submit to them; for they watch in
behalf of your souls as they that shall give account.” (<scripRef passage="Heb. xiii. 17" id="v.xv-p42.1" parsed="|Heb|13|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Heb.13.17">Heb. xiii. 17</scripRef>.) For this rule is as
much better than the political as heaven is than earth; yea rather,
even much more. For, in the first place, it considers principally
not how it may punish sins committed, but how, they may never be
committed at all; next, when committed, not how it may remove the
deceased [member], but how they may be blotted out. And of the
things of this life indeed it maketh not much account, but all its
transactions are about the things in heaven. “For our
citizenship<note place="end" n="789" id="v.xv-p42.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xv-p43"> <i>conversation</i> A.V.</p></note> is in
heaven.” (<scripRef passage="Philip. iii. 20" id="v.xv-p43.1" parsed="|Phil|3|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Phil.3.20">Philip. iii. 20</scripRef>.) And our life is here.
“For our life,” saith he, “is hid with Christ in God.”
(<scripRef passage="Col. iii. 3" id="v.xv-p43.2" parsed="|Col|3|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Col.3.3">Col. iii. 3</scripRef>.) And our prizes are
there, and our race is for the crowns that be there. For this
life is not dissolved after the end, but then shineth forth the
more. And therefore, in truth, they who bear this rule have a
greater honor committed to their hands, not only than viceroys but
even than those themselves who wear diadems, seeing that they mould
men in greater, and for greater, things. But neither he that
pursueth political rule nor he that pursueth spiritual, will be
able well to administer it, unless they have first ruled themselves
as they ought, and have observed with all strictness the respective
laws of their polity. For as the rule over the many is in a
manner twofold, so also is that which each one exerts over
himself. And again, in this point also the spiritual rule
transcends the political, as what we have said proved. But one
may observe certain also of the arts imitating rule; and in
particular, that of agriculture. For just as the tiller of the
soil is in a sort a ruler over the plants, clipping and keeping
back<note place="end" n="790" id="v.xv-p43.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.xv-p44"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xv-p44.1">κωλύων</span>, others, <span class="Greek" id="v.xv-p44.2">κολούων</span>.</p></note> some, making
others grow and fostering them: just so also the best rulers
punish and cut off such as are wicked and injure the many; whilst
they advance the good and orderly<note place="end" n="791" id="v.xv-p44.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.xv-p45"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xv-p45.1">ἐ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.xv-p45.2">πιεικεῖς</span>.</p></note>. For this cause also the
Scripture likeneth rulers to vine-dressers. For what though
plants utter no cry, as in states the injured do? nevertheless they
still show the wrong by their appearance, withering, straitened for
room by the worthless weeds. And like as <pb n="354" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_354.html" id="v.xv-Page_354" />wickedness is punished by laws,
so truly here also by this art both badness of soil and degeneracy
and wildness in plants, are corrected. For all the varieties of
human dispositions we shall find here also, roughness, weakness,
timidity, forwardness<note place="end" n="792" id="v.xv-p45.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.xv-p46"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xv-p46.1">προπέτεια</span>.</p></note>, steadiness<note place="end" n="793" id="v.xv-p46.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xv-p47"> Or, healthiness.</p></note>: and some of them through
wealth<note place="end" n="794" id="v.xv-p47.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xv-p48"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xv-p48.1">κομῶντα</span>.</p></note> luxuriating
unseasonably, and to the damage of their neighbors, and others
impoverished and injured; as, for instance, when hedges are raised
to luxuriance at the cost of the neighboring plants; when other
barren and wild trees, running up to a great height, hinder the
growth of those beneath them. And like as rulers and kings have
those that vex their rule with outrage and war; so also hath the
tiller of the soil attacks of wild beasts, irregularity of weather,
hail, mildew, great rain, drought, and all such things. But these
things happen in order that thou mayest constantly look unto the
hope of God’s aid. For the other arts indeed hold their way<note place="end" n="795" id="v.xv-p48.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xv-p49"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xv-p49.1">συνίστανται</span>.</p></note> through the
diligence of men as well; but this getteth the better as God
determines the balance, and is throughout almost wholly dependent
thereupon; and it needeth rains from above, and the admixture of
weathers, and, above all, His Providence. “For neither is he
that planteth any thing, nor he that watereth, but God that giveth
the increase.” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. iii. 7" id="v.xv-p49.2" parsed="|1Cor|3|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.3.7">1 Cor. iii. 7</scripRef>.)</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xv-p50">Here also there is death and life, and throes
and procreation, just as with men. For here happen instances both
of being cut off, and of bearing fruit, and of dying, and of being
born (the same that was dead) over again, wherein the earth
discourseth to us both variously and clearly of a resurrection.
For when the root beareth fruit, when the seed shooteth, is not the
thing a resurrection? And one might perceive a large measure of
God’s providence and wisdom involved in this rule, if one go over
it point by point. But what I wished to say is that this [rule]
is concerned with earth and plants; but ours with care of souls.
And great as is the difference between plants and a soul; so great
is the superiority of this to that. And the rulers of the present
life again are as much inferior to that [rule], as it is better to
have mastery over the willing than the unwilling. For this is
also a natural rule; for truly in that case every thing is done
through fear and by constraint; but here, what is done aright is of
choice and purpose. And not in this point alone doth this excel
the other, but in that it is not only a rule, but a fatherhood<note place="end" n="796" id="v.xv-p50.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xv-p51"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xv-p51.1">πατρότης</span>.</p></note> so to speak;
for it has the gentleness of a father; and whilst enjoining greater
things, [still] persuades. For the temporal ruler indeed says,
‘If thou committest adultery, thou hast forfeited thy life,’
but this, shouldst thou look with unchaste eyes, threatens the
highest punishments. For awful is this judgment court, and for
the correction of soul, not of body only. As great then as the
difference between soul and body, is that which separates this rule
again from that. And the one indeed sitteth as judge of things
that are open; yea, rather, not of all these even, but of such as
can be fully proved; and ofttimes moreover, even in these dealeth
treacherously<note place="end" n="797" id="v.xv-p51.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xv-p52"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xv-p52.1">προδότης</span>.</p></note>, but this
court instructeth those that enter it that He that judgeth in our
case, will bring forward “all things naked and laid open,”
(<scripRef passage="Heb. iv. 13" id="v.xv-p52.2" parsed="|Heb|4|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Heb.4.13">Heb. iv. 13</scripRef>.) before the common
theatre of the world, and that to be hidden will be impossible.
So that Christianity keeps together this our life far more than
temporal<note place="end" n="798" id="v.xv-p52.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.xv-p53"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xv-p53.1">ἑ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.xv-p53.2">ξωθεν</span>.</p></note> laws. For
if to tremble about secret sins makes a man safer than to fear for
such as are open; and if to call him to account even for those
offences which be less doth rather excite him unto virtue, than to
punish the graver only; then it is easily seen that this rule, more
than all others, welds<note place="end" n="799" id="v.xv-p53.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.xv-p54"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xv-p54.1">συγκροτεῖ</span>.</p></note> our life together.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xv-p55">[6.] But, if thou wilt, let us consider also the
mode of electing the rulers; for here too thou shalt behold the
difference to be great. For it is not possible to gain this
authority by giving money, but by having displayed a highly
virtuous character; and not as unto glory with men and ease unto
himself, but as unto toils and labors and the welfare of the many,
thus, (I say,) is he that hath been appointed inducted unto this
rule. Wherefore also abundant is the assistance he enjoys from
the Spirit. And in that case indeed the rule can go no further
than to declare merely what is to be done; but in this it addeth
besides the help derived from prayers and from the Spirit. But
further; in that case indeed is not a word about philosophy, nor
doth any sit to teach what a soul is, and what the world, and what
we are to be hereafter, and unto what things we shall depart hence,
and how we shall achieve virtue. Howbeit of contracts and bonds
and money, there is much speech, but of those things not a thought;
whereas in the Church one may see that these are the subjects of
every discourse. Wherefore also with justice may one call it by
all these names, a court of justice, and a hospital, and a school
of philosophy, and a nursery of the soul, and a training course for
that race that leadeth unto heaven. Further, that this rule is
also the mildest of all, even though requiring greater strictness,
is plain from hence. For the temporal ruler if he catch an
adulterer <pb n="355" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_355.html" id="v.xv-Page_355" />straightway
punishes him. And yet what is the advantage of this? For this
is not to destroy the passion, but to send away the soul with its
wound upon it. But this ruler, when he hath detected, considers
not how he shall avenge, but how extirpate the passion. For thou
indeed dost the same thing, as if when there was a disease of the
head, thou shouldest not stay the disease, but cut off the head.
But I do not thus: but I cut off the disease. And I exclude him
indeed from mysteries and hallowed precincts; but when I have
restored him I receive him back again, at once delivered from that
viciousness and amended by his repentance. ‘And how is it
possible,’ saith one, ‘to extirpate adultery?’ It is
possible, yea, very possible, if a man comes under these laws.
For the Church is a spiritual bath, which wipeth away not filth of
body, but stains of soul, by its many methods of repentance. For
thou, indeed, both if thou let a man go unpunished hast made him
worse, and if thou punish hast sent him away uncured: but I
neither let him go unpunished, nor punish him, as thou, but both
exact a satisfaction which becomes me, and set that right which
hath been done. Wilt thou learn in yet another way how that thou
indeed, though drawing swords and displaying flames to them that
offend, workest not any considerable cure; whilst I, without these
things, have conducted them to perfect health? But no need have I
of arguments or words, but I bring forth earth and sea, and human
nature itself, [for witnesses.] And inquire, before this court
held its sittings, what was the condition of human affairs; how,
not even the names of the good works which now are done, were ever
heard of. For who braved death? who despised money? who was
indifferent to glory? who, fleeing from the turmoils of life<note place="end" n="800" id="v.xv-p55.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xv-p56"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xv-p56.1">ἐν
μέσῳ</span>.</p></note>, bade
welcome to mountains and solitude, the mother of heavenly wisdom?
where was at all the name of virginity? For all these things, and
more than these, were the good work of this judgment court, the
doings of this rule. Knowing these things then, and well
understanding that from this proceedeth every benefit of our life,
and the reformation of the world, come frequently unto the hearing
of the Divine words, and our assemblies here, and the prayers.
For if ye thus order yourselves, ye will be able, having displayed
a deportment worthy of heaven, to obtain the promised good things;
which may all we obtain, through the grace and love towards men of
our Lord Jesus Christ, to Whom be glory for ever and ever.
Amen.</p>

<p class="c24" id="v.xvi-p4"><span class="c18" id="v.xvi-p4.1">See</span> again how he
exalts their praises, and showeth their love. For having said,
‘I was pleased that my Epistle wrought so much and that ye gained
so much,’ for “I rejoice,” he saith, “not that ye were made
sorry, but that ye were made sorry unto repentance;” and having
shown his own love, for he saith, “Though I wrote unto you, I
wrote not for his cause that did the wrong, nor for his cause that
suffered the wrong, but that our care for you might be made
manifest to you:” again he mentioneth another sign of their
good will, which bringeth them great praise and showeth the
genuineness of their affection. For, “in your comfort<note place="end" n="801" id="v.xvi-p4.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xvi-p5"> In the R.T. the words “in your comfort” are
connected with what precedes, not what follows them. [The Rev.
Vers. adopts Chrysostom’s connection but changes the pronoun from

C.]</p></note>,” he
saith, “we joyed the more exceedingly for the joy of Titus.”
And yet this is no sign of one that loveth them exceedingly;
rejoicing rather for Titus than for them. ‘Yes,’ he replies,
‘it is, for I joyed not so much for his cause as for yours.’
Therefore also he subjoins the reason, saying, “because his
bowels were refreshed by you all.” He said not, ‘he,’ but
“his bowels;” that is, ‘his love for you.’ And how were
they refreshed? “By all.” For this too is a very great
praise.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xvi-p6"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 7.14" id="v.xvi-p6.1" parsed="|2Cor|7|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.7.14">Ver. 14</scripRef>. “For if in anything I
have gloried to him on your behalf.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xvi-p7">It is high praise when the teacher boasted, for he
saith, “I was not put to shame.” I therefore rejoiced,
because ye showed yourselves to be amended and proved my words by
your deeds. So that the honor accruing to me was twofold; first,
in that ye had made progress; next, in that I was not found to fall
short of the truth.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xvi-p8"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 7.14" id="v.xvi-p8.1" parsed="|2Cor|7|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.7.14">Ver. 14</scripRef>. “But as we spake always
to you in <pb n="356" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_356.html" id="v.xvi-Page_356" />truth, so our
glorying also which I made before Titus was found to be
truth.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xvi-p9">Here he alludes to something further. As we
spake all things among you in truth, (for it is probable that he
had also spoken to them much in praise of this man<note place="end" n="802" id="v.xvi-p9.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xvi-p10"> i.e. Titus.</p></note>,) so also,
what we said of you to Titus has been proved true.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xvi-p11"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 7.15" id="v.xvi-p11.1" parsed="|2Cor|7|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.7.15">Ver. 15</scripRef>. “And his inward
affection<note place="end" n="803" id="v.xvi-p11.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xvi-p12"> Gr. <i>bowels</i>.</p></note> is more
abundant toward you.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xvi-p13">What follows is in commendation of him, as
exceedingly consumed with love and attached to them. And he said
not ‘his love.’ Then that he may not appear to be flattering,
he everywhere mentions the causes of his affection; in order that
he may, as I said, both escape the imputation of flattery and the
more encourage them by making the praise redound unto them, and by
showing that it was they who had infused into him the beginning and
ground of this so great love. For having said, “his inward
affection is more abundant toward you;” he added,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xvi-p14">“Whilst he remembereth the obedience of you
all.” Now this both shows that Titus was grateful to his
benefactors, seeing he had returned, having them all in his heart,
and continually remembereth them, and beareth them on his lips and
in his mind; and also is a greater distinction to the Corinthians,
seeing that so vanquished they sent him away. Then he mentions
their obedience also, magnifying their zeal: wherefore also he
addeth these words,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xvi-p15">“How with fear and trembling ye received him.”
Not with love only, but also with excessive honor. Seest thou how
he bears witness to a twofold virtue in them, both that they loved
him as a father and had feared him as a ruler, neither for fear
dimming love, nor for love relaxing fear. He expressed this also
above, “That ye sorrow after a godly sort, what earnest care it
wrought in you; yea what fear, yea what longing.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xvi-p16"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 7.16" id="v.xvi-p16.1" parsed="|2Cor|7|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.7.16">Ver. 16</scripRef>. “I rejoice therefore,
that in every thing I am of good courage concerning you.” Seest
thou that he rejoiceth more on their account; ‘because,’ he
saith, ‘ye have in no particular shamed your teacher, nor show
yourselves unworthy of my testimony.’ So that he joyed not so
much for Titus’ sake, that he enjoyed so great honor; as for
their own, that they had displayed so much good feeling. For that
he may not be imagined to joy rather on Titus’ account, observe
how in this place also he states the reason. As then he said
above, “If in anything I have gloried to him on your behalf I was
not put to shame;” so here also, “In everything I am of good
courage concerning you.” ‘Should need require me to rebuke, I
have no apprehension of your being alienated; or again to boast, I
fear not to be convicted of falsehood; or to praise you as obeying
the rein, or as loving, or as full of zeal, I have confidence in
you. I bade you cut off, and ye did cut off; I bade you receive,
and ye did receive; I said before Titus that ye were great and
admirable kind of people and knew to reverence teachers: ye
proved these things true by your conduct. And he learnt these
things not so much from me as from you. At any rate when he
returned, he had become a passionate lover of you: your behavior
having surpassed what he had been told.’</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xvi-p17">[2.] <scripRef passage="2 Cor. 8.1" id="v.xvi-p17.1" parsed="|2Cor|8|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.8.1">Chap. viii. ver. 1</scripRef>. “Moreover, brethren, we
make known to you the grace of God which hath been given in the
Churches of Macedonia.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xvi-p18">Having encouraged them with these encomiums, he
again tries exhortation. For on this account he mingled these
praises with his rebuke, that he might not by proceeding from
rebuke to exhortation make what he had to say ill received; but
having soothed their ears, might by this means pave the way for his
exhortation. For he purposeth to discourse of alms-giving;
wherefore also he saith beforehand, “I rejoice that in everything
I am of good courage concerning you;” by their past good works,
making them the more ready to this duty also. And he said not at
once, ‘Therefore give alms,’ but observe his wisdom, how he
draws from a distance and from on high the preparation for his
discourse. For he says, “I make known to you the grace of God
which hath been given in the Churches of Macedonia.” For that
they might not be uplifted he calleth what they did “grace;”
and whilst relating what others did he worketh greater zeal in them
by his encomiums on others. And he mentions together two praises
of the Macedonians, or rather three; namely, that they bear trials
nobly; and that they know how to pity; and that, though poor, they
had displayed profuseness in almsgiving, for their property had
been also plundered. And when he wrote his Epistle to them, it
was as signifying this that he said, “For ye became imitators of
the Churches of God which are in Judæa, for ye also suffered the
same things of your own countrymen, even as they did of the
Jews.” (<scripRef passage="1 Thess. ii. 14" id="v.xvi-p18.1" parsed="|1Thess|2|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Thess.2.14">1 Thess. ii.
14</scripRef>.) Hear what he said
afterwards in writing to the Hebrews, “For ye took joyfully the
spoiling of your possessions.” (<scripRef passage="Heb. x. 34" id="v.xvi-p18.2" parsed="|Heb|10|34|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Heb.10.34">Heb. x. 34</scripRef>.) But He calls what they did
“grace,” not in order to keep them humble merely; but both to
provoke them to emulation and to prevent what he said from proving
invidious. Wherefore he also added the name of “brethren” so
as to undermine all envious feeling; for he is about to praise them
in high-flown <pb n="357" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_357.html" id="v.xvi-Page_357" />terms. Listen,
at least, to his praises. For having said, “I make known to you
the grace of God,” he said not  ‘which hath been given in this
or that city,’ but praiseth the entire nation, saying, “in the
Churches of Macedonia.” Then he details also this same
grace.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xvi-p19"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 8.2" id="v.xvi-p19.1" parsed="|2Cor|8|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.8.2">Ver. 2</scripRef>.
“How that in much proof of affliction the abundance of their
joy.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xvi-p20">Seest thou his wisdom? For he says not
first, that which he wishes; but another thing before it, that he
may not seem to do this of set purpose<note place="end" n="804" id="v.xvi-p20.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xvi-p21"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xvi-p21.1">ἐ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.xvi-p21.2">πίτηδες</span>.</p></note>, but to arrive at it by a different
connection. “In much proof of affliction.” This was what he
said in his Epistle to the Macedonians themselves, “Ye became
imitators of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction,
with joy of the Holy Ghost;” and again, “From you sounded forth
the word of the Lord, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in
every place, your faith to God-ward is gone forth.”
(<scripRef passage="1 Thess. i. 6, 8" id="v.xvi-p21.3" parsed="|1Thess|1|6|0|0;|1Thess|1|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Thess.1.6 Bible:1Thess.1.8">1 Thess. i. 6,
8</scripRef>.) But what is, “in
much proof of affliction the abundance of their joy?” Both, he
says, happened to them in excess; both the affliction and the
joy. Wherefore also the strangeness was great that so great an
excess of pleasure sprang up to them out of affliction. For in
truth the affliction not only was not the parent of grief, but it
even became unto them an occasion of gladness; and this too, though
it was “great.” Now this he said, to prepare them to be noble
and firm in their trials. For they were not merely afflicted, but
so as also to have become approved by their patience: yea rather,
he says not by their patience, but what was more than patience,
“joy.” And neither said he “joy” simply, but “abundance
of joy,” for it sprang up in them, great and unspeakable.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xvi-p22">[3.] “And their deep poverty abounded unto the
riches of their liberality.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xvi-p23">Again, both these with excessiveness. For as their
great affliction gave birth to great joy, yea, “abundance of
joy,” so their great poverty gave birth to great riches of
alms. For this he showed, saying, “abounded unto the riches of
their liberality.” For munificence is determined not by the
measure of what is given, but by the mind of those that bestow
it.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xvi-p24">Wherefore he nowhere says, ‘the richness of the
gifts,’ but “the riches of their liberality.” Now what he
says is to this effect; ‘their poverty not only was no impediment
to their being bountiful, but was even an occasion to them of
abounding, just as affliction was of feeling joy. For the poorer
they were, the more munificent they were and contributed the more
readily.’ Wherefore also he admires them exceedingly, for that
in the midst of so great poverty they had displayed so great
munificence. For “their deep,” that is, ‘their great and
unspeakable,’ “poverty,” showed their “liberality.” But
he said not ‘showed,’ but “abounded;” and he said not
“liberality,” but “riches of liberality;” that is, an
equipoise to the greatness of their poverty, or rather much
outweighing it, was the bountifulness they displayed. Then he
even explains this more clearly, saying,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xvi-p25"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 8.3" id="v.xvi-p25.1" parsed="|2Cor|8|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.8.3">Ver. 3</scripRef>.
“For according to their power, I bear witness.” Trustworthy
is the witness. “And beyond their power.” That is, it
“abounded unto the riches of their liberality.” Or rather, he
makes this plain, not by this expression alone, but also by all
that follows; for he says, “of their own accord.” Lo! yet
another excessiveness.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xvi-p26"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 8.4" id="v.xvi-p26.1" parsed="|2Cor|8|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.8.4">Ver. 4</scripRef>. “With much
intreaty.” Lo! yet a third and a fourth. “Praying us.”
Lo! even a fifth. And when they were in affliction and in
poverty. Here are a sixth and seventh. And they gave with
excessiveness. Then since this is what he most of all wishes to
provide for in the Corinthians’ case, namely, the giving
deliberately, he dwells especially upon it, saying, “with much
intreaty,” and “praying us.” ‘We prayed not them, but
they us.’ Pray us what? “That the grace<note place="end" n="805" id="v.xvi-p26.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xvi-p27"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xvi-p27.1">χαρὶν</span>.</p></note> and the fellowship in the
ministering to the saints.” Seest thou how he again exalts the
deed, calling it by venerable names. For since they were
ambitious<note place="end" n="806" id="v.xvi-p27.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xvi-p28"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xvi-p28.1">ζηλωταὶ</span>.</p></note> of spiritual
gifts<note place="end" n="807" id="v.xvi-p28.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xvi-p29"> Literally, <i>spirits</i>.</p></note>, he calls it
by the name grace that they might eagerly pursue it; and again by
that of “fellowship,” that they might learn that they receive,
not give only. ‘This therefore they intreated us,’ he says,
‘that we would take upon us such a ministry<note place="end" n="808" id="v.xvi-p29.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xvi-p30"> [Critical authority is altogether in favor of the
text of this clause which is adopted in the Rev. Vers. C.]</p></note>.’</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xvi-p31"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 8.5" id="v.xvi-p31.1" parsed="|2Cor|8|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.8.5">Ver. 5</scripRef>.
“And” this, “not as we hoped.” This he says with
reference both to the amount and to their afflictions. ‘For we
could never have hoped,’ he says, ‘that whilst in so great
affliction and poverty, they would even have urged us and so
greatly intreated us.’ He showed also their carefulness of life
in other respects, by saying,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xvi-p32">“But first they gave their own selves to the Lord,
and to us by the will of God.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xvi-p33">‘For in everything their obedience was beyond our
expectations; nor because they showed mercy did they neglect the
other virtues,’ “but first gave themselves to the Lord.”
What is, “gave themselves to the Lord?” ‘They offered up
[themselves]; they showed themselves approved in faith; they
displayed much fortitude in their trials, order, goodness, love, in
all things both readiness and zeal.’ What means, “and to
us?” ‘They were tractable to the rein, loved, obeyed us; both
<pb n="358" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_358.html" id="v.xvi-Page_358" />fulfilling the laws of
God and bound unto us by love.’ And observe how here also he
again shows their earnestness<note place="end" n="809" id="v.xvi-p33.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xvi-p34"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xvi-p34.1">ἐ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.xvi-p34.2">πίτασιν</span>.</p></note>, saying, “gave themselves to the
Lord.” They did not in some things obey God, and in some the
world; but in all things Him; and gave themselves wholly unto
God. For neither because they showed mercy were they filled up
with senseless pride, but displaying much lowlymindedness, much
obedience, much reverence, much heavenly wisdom, they so wrought
their almsdeeds also. But what is, “by the will of God?”
Since he had said, they “gave themselves to us,” yet was it not
“to us,” after the manner of men, but they did this also
according to the mind of God.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xvi-p37">And what connexion is there here? Much; and
closely bearing on what went before. ‘For because we saw them
vehement,’ he says, ‘and fervent in all things, in temptations,
in almsgiving, in their love toward us, in the purity otherwise of
their life: in order that ye too might be made their equals, we
sent Titus.’ Howbeit he did not say this, though he implied
it. Behold excessiveness of love. ‘For though intreated and
desired by them,’ he says, ‘we were anxious about your state,
lest by any means ye should come short of them. Wherefore also we
sent Titus, that by this also being stirred up and put in mind, ye
might emulate the Macedonians.’ For Titus happened to be there
when this Epistle was writing. Yet he shows that he had made a
beginning in this matter before Paul’s exhortation; “that as he
had made a beginning before,” he says. Wherefore also he
bestows great praise on him; for instance, in the beginning [of the
Epistle]; “Because I found not Titus my brother, I had no relief
for my spirit:” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. 2.13" id="v.xvi-p37.1" parsed="|2Cor|2|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.2.13">chap. ii. 13</scripRef>.) and here all those
things which he has said, and this too itself. For this also is
no light praise, the having begun before even: for this evinces a
warm and fervent spirit. Wherefore also he sent him, infusing<note place="end" n="811" id="v.xvi-p37.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xvi-p38"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xvi-p38.1">ἐ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.xvi-p38.2">ντιθεὶς</span>.</p></note> amongst them
in this also a very great incentive unto giving, the presence of
Titus. On this account also he extols him with praises, wishing
to endear him more exceedingly to the Corinthians. For this too
hath a great weight unto persuading, when he who counsels is upon
intimate terms. And well does he both once and twice and thrice,
having made mention of almsgiving, call ‘it grace,’ now indeed
saying, “Moreover, brethren, I make known to you the grace of God
bestowed on the Churches of Macedonia;” and now, “they of their
own accord, praying us with much intreaty in regard of this grace
and fellowship:” and again, “that as he had begun, so he
would also finish in you this grace also.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xvi-p39">[5.] For this is a great good and a gift of
God; and rightly done assimilates us, so far as may be, unto God;
for such an one<note place="end" n="812" id="v.xvi-p39.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xvi-p40"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xvi-p40.1">τοῦτο</span>, in sense

Matt</i>. on the word <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xvi-p40.3">οὗτος</span>.</p></note> is in the
highest sense a man. A certain one, at least, giving a model of a
man has mentioned this, for “Man,” saith he, “is a great
thing; and a merciful man is an honorable thing.” (<scripRef passage="Prov. xx. 6" id="v.xvi-p40.4" parsed="|Prov|20|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Prov.20.6">Prov. xx. 6</scripRef>. LXX.) Greater is this
gift than to raise the dead. For far greater is it to feed Christ
when an hungered than to raise the dead by the name of Jesus: for
in the former case thou doest good to Christ, in the latter He to
thee. And the reward surely comes by doing good, not by receiving
good. For here indeed, in the case of miracles I mean, thou art
God’s debtor; in that of almsgiving, thou hast God for a
debtor. Now it is almsgiving, when it is done with willingness,
when with bountifulness, when thou deemest thyself not to give but
to receive, when done as if thou wert benefitted, as if gaining and
not losing; for so this were not a grace. For he that showeth
mercy on another ought to feel joyful, not peevish. For how is it
not absurd, if whilst removing another’s downheartedness, thou
art thyself downhearted? for so thou no longer sufferest it to be
alms. For if thou art downhearted because thou hast delivered
another from downheartedness, thou furnishest an example of extreme
cruelty and inhumanity; for it were better not to deliver him, than
so to deliver him. And why art thou also downhearted at all, O
man? for fear thy gold should diminish? If such are thy thoughts,
do not give at all: if thou art not quite sure that it is
multiplied for thee in heaven, do not bestow. But thou seekest
the recompense here. Wherefore? Let thine alms be alms, and not
traffic. Now many have indeed received a recompense even here;
but have not so received it, as if they should have an advantage
over those who received it not here; but some of them as being
weaker than they ought, because they were not so strongly attracted
by the things which are there. And as those who are greedy, and
ill-mannered<note place="end" n="813" id="v.xvi-p40.5"><p class="endnote" id="v.xvi-p41"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xvi-p41.1">ἀ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.xvi-p41.2">πειρόκαλοι</span>.</p></note>, and slaves
of their bellies, being invited to a royal banquet, and unable to
wait till the proper time, just like little children mar their own
enjoyment, by taking food beforehand and stuffing themselves with
inferior dishes: even so in truth do these who seek for and
receive [recompense] 
<pb n="359" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_359.html" id="v.xvi-Page_359" />here, diminish their reward there. Further,
when thou lendest, thou wishest to receive thy principal after a
longer interval, and perhaps even not to receive it at all, in
order that by the delay thou mayest make the interest greater; but,
in this case, dost thou ask back immediately; and that too when
thou art about to be not here, but there forever; when thou art
about not to be here to be judged, but to render thine account? 
And if indeed one were building thee mansions where thou wert not
going to remain, thou wouldest deem it to be a loss; but now,
desirest thou here to be rich, whence possibly thou art to depart
even before the evening? Knowest thou not that we live in a
foreign land, as though strangers and sojourners? Knowest thou
not that it is the lot of sojourners to be ejected when they think
not, expect not? which is also our lot. For this reason then,
whatsoever things we have prepared, we leave here. For the Lord
does not allow us to receive them and depart, if we have built
houses, if we have bought fields, if slaves, if gear, if any other
such thing. But not only does He not allow us to take them and
depart hence, but doth not even account to thee the price of
them. For He forwarned thee that thou shouldest not build, nor
spend what is other men’s but thine own. Why therefore, leaving
what is thine own, dost thou work and be at cost in what is
another’s, so as to lose both thy toil and thy wages and to
suffer the extremest punishment? Do not so, I beseech thee; but
seeing we are by nature sojourners, let us also be so by choice;
that we be not there sojourners and dishonored and cast out. For
if we are set upon being citizens here, we shall be so neither here
nor there; but if we continue to be sojourners, and live in such
wise as sojourners ought to live in, we shall enjoy the freedom of
citizens both here and there. For the just, although having
nothing, will both dwell here amidst all men’s possessions as
though they were his own; and also, when he hath departed to
heaven, shall see those his eternal habitations. And he shall
both here suffer no discomfort, (for none will ever be able to make
him a stranger that hath every land for his city;) and when he hath
been restored to his own country, shall receive the true riches.
In order that we may gain both the things of this life and of that,
let us use aright the things we have. For so shall we be citizens
of the heavens, and shall enjoy much boldness; whereunto may we all
attain, through the grace and love towards men of our Lord Jesus
Christ, with Whom to the Father with the Holy Ghost, be glory and
power for ever. Amen.</p>

utterance, and knowledge, and in all earnestness.</p>

<p class="c24" id="v.xvii-p6"><span class="c18" id="v.xvii-p6.1">See</span> again his exhortation
accompanied with commendations, greater commendations. And he
said not, ‘that ye give,’ but “that ye abound; in faith,”
namely, of the gifts, and “in utterance,” the word of wisdom,
and “knowledge,” namely, of the doctrines, and “in all
earnestness,” to the attaining of all other virtue.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xvii-p7">“And in your love,” that, namely of which I have
before spoken, of which I have also made proof.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xvii-p8">“That ye may abound in this grace also.” Seest
thou that for this reason it was that he began by those praises,
that advancing forward he might draw them on to the same diligence
in these things also.</p>

“I speak not by way of commandment.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xvii-p10">See how constantly he humors them, how he avoids
offensiveness, and is not violent nor compulsory; or rather what he
says hath both these, with the inoffensiveness of that which is
uncompelled. For after he had repeatedly exhorted them and had
greatly commended the Macedonians, in order that this might not
seem to constitute a necessity, he says,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xvii-p11">“I speak not by way of commandment, but as proving
through the earnestness of others, the sincerity also of your
love.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xvii-p12">‘Not as doubting it,’ (for that is not what he
would here imply,) ‘but to make it approved, display it and frame
it unto greater strength. For I therefore say these things that I
may provoke you to the same forwardness. And I 
<pb n="360" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_360.html" id="v.xvii-Page_360" />mention their zeal to brighten, to cheer,
to stimulate your inclinations.’ Then from this he proceeded to
another and a greater point. For he lets slip no mode of
persuasion, but moves heaven and earth<note place="end" n="816" id="v.xvii-p12.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xvii-p13"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xvii-p13.1">πάντα κινεῖ</span>.</p></note> in handling his argument. For he
exhorted them both by other men’s praises, saying, Ye know “the
grace of God which hath been given in the Churches of Macedonia;”
and by their own, “therefore that ye abound in everything, in
utterance and knowledge.” For this hath power to sting man more
that he falls short of himself, than that he does so of others.
Then he proceeds afterwards to the head and crown of his
persuasion.</p>

“For ye know the grace of our Lord, that though He was rich, yet
for our sakes He became poor, that we through His poverty might
become rich.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xvii-p15">‘For have in mind,’ says he, ‘ponder and
consider the grace of God and do not lightly pass it by, but aim at
realizing<note place="end" n="817" id="v.xvii-p15.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xvii-p16"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xvii-p16.1">στοχάσασθε</span>.</p></note> the

thine. He emptied Himself of His glory that ye, not through His
riches but through His poverty, might be rich. If thou believest
not that poverty is productive of riches, have in mind thy Lord and
thou wilt doubt no longer. For had He not become poor, thou
wouldest not have become rich. For this is the marvel, that
poverty hath made riches rich.’ And by riches here he meaneth
the knowledge of godliness, the cleansing away of sins,
justification, sanctification, the countless good things which He
bestowed upon us and purposeth to bestow. And all these things
accrued to us through His poverty. What poverty? Through His
taking flesh on Him and becoming man and suffering what He
suffered. And yet he owed not this, but thou dost owe to
Him.</p>

for your profit.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xvii-p20">See how again he is careful to give no offence and
softens down what he says, by these two things, by saying, “I
give advice,” and, “for your profit.” ‘For, neither do I
compel and force you,’ says he, ‘or demand it from unwilling
subjects; nor do I say these things with an eye so much to the
receivers benefit as to yours.’ Then the instance also which
follows is drawn from themselves, and not from others.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xvii-p21">“Who were the first to make a beginning a year
ago, not only to do, but also to will.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xvii-p22">See how he shows both that themselves were willing,
and had come to this resolution without persuasion. For since he
had borne this witness to the Thessalonians, that “of their own
accord with much intreaty,” they had prosecuted this giving of
alms; he is desirous of showing of these also that this good work
is their own. Wherefore he said, “not only to do, but also to
will,” and not “begun,” but “begun before, a year ago.”
Unto these things therefore I exhort you, whereunto ye beforehand
bestirred yourselves with all forwardness.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xvii-p25">He said not, ye have done it, but, ye have put a
completion to it,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xvii-p26">“That as there was the readiness to will, so also
[there may be] the completion also out of your ability.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xvii-p27">That this good work halt not at readiness but
receive also the reward that follows upon deeds.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xvii-p28">[2.] <scripRef passage="2 Cor. 8.12" id="v.xvii-p28.1" parsed="|2Cor|8|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.8.12">Ver. 12</scripRef>. “For if the readiness is
there, it is acceptable according as a man hath, not according as
he hath not.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xvii-p29">See wisdom unspeakable. In that (having pointed
out those who were doing beyond their power, I mean the
Thessalonians, and having praised them for this and said, “I bear
them record that even beyond their power;”) he exhorteth the
Corinthians to do only “after” their power, leaving the example
to do its own work; for he knew that not so much exhortation, as
emulation, inciteth unto imitation of the like; wherefore he saith,
“For if the readiness is there, it is acceptable according as a
man hath, not according as he hath not.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xvii-p30">‘Fear not,’ he means, ‘because I have
said these things, for what I said was an encomium upon their
munificence<note place="end" n="821" id="v.xvii-p30.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xvii-p31"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xvii-p31.1">φιλοτιμίας</span>.</p></note>, but God
requires things after a man’s power,’ “according as he hath,
not according as he hath not.” For the word “is
acceptable,” here implies ‘is required.’ And he softens<note place="end" n="822" id="v.xvii-p31.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xvii-p32"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xvii-p32.1">λιπαίνει</span>.</p></note> it greatly,
in confident reliance upon this example, and as winning them more
surely by leaving them at liberty. Wherefore also he
added,</p>

others may be eased, and ye distressed.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xvii-p34">And yet Christ praised the contrary conduct in the
widow’s case, that she emptied out all of her living and gave out
of her want. (<scripRef passage="Mark xii. 43" id="v.xvii-p34.1" parsed="|Mark|12|43|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Mark.12.43">Mark xii.
43</scripRef>.) But because he was
discoursing to Corinthians amongst whom he chose to suffer hunger;
“for it were good for me rather to die, than that any man should
make my glorying void;” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. ix. 15" id="v.xvii-p34.2" parsed="|1Cor|9|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.9.15">1 Cor. ix. 15</scripRef>.) he therefore uses a tempered
exhortation, praising indeed those who had done beyond their power,
but not compelling these to do so; not because he <pb n="361" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_361.html" id="v.xvii-Page_361" />did not desire it, but because they
were somewhat weak. For wherefore doth he praise those, because
“in much proof of affliction the abundance of their joy and their
deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality:” and
because they gave “beyond their power?” is it not very evident
that it is as inducing these also to this conduct? So that even
if he appears to permit a lower standard; he doth so, that by it he
may raise them to this. Consider, for instance, how even in what
follows he is covertly preparing the way for this. For having
said these things, he added,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xvii-p35"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 8.14" id="v.xvii-p35.1" parsed="|2Cor|8|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.8.14">Ver. 14</scripRef>. “Your abundance being a
supply for their want.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xvii-p36">For not only by the words he has before used
but by these also, he is desirous of making the commandment
light. Nor yet from this consideration alone, but from that of
the recompense also, again he maketh it easier; and uttereth higher
things than they deserve, saying, “That there may be equality at
this time, and their abundance” a supply “for your want.”
Now what is it that he saith? ‘Ye are flourishing<note place="end" n="823" id="v.xvii-p36.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xvii-p37"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xvii-p37.1">κομᾶτε</span>.</p></note> in money;
they in life<note place="end" n="824" id="v.xvii-p37.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xvii-p38"> i.e. holiness of life.</p></note> and in
boldness towards God.’ ‘Give ye to them, therefore, of the
money which ye abound in but they have not; that ye may receive of
that boldness wherein they are rich and ye are lacking.’ See
how he hath covertly prepared for their giving beyond their power
and of their want. ‘For,’ he saith, ‘if thou desirest to
receive of their abundance, give of thine abundance; but if to win
for thyself the whole, thou wilt give of thy want and beyond thy
power.’ He doth not say this, however, but leaves it to the
reasoning of his hearers; and himself meanwhile works out his
object and the exhortation that was meet, adding in keeping with
what appeared, the words, that “there may be equality at this
time.” How equality? You and they mutually giving your
superabundance, and filling up your wants. And what sort of
equality is this, giving spiritual things for carnal? for great is
the advantage on that side; how then doth he call it
“equality?” either in respect of each abounding and wanting,
doth he say that this [equality] takes place; or else in respect of
the present life only. And therefore after saying “equality,”
he added, “at this time.” Now this he said, both to subdue
the high-mindedness of the rich, and to show that after our
departure hence the spiritual possess the greater advantage. For
here indeed we all enjoy much equality of honor; but then there
will be a wide distinction and a very great superiority, when the
just shine brighter than the sun. Then since he showed that they
were to be not only giving, but also receiving, and more, in
return; he tries by a further consideration to make them forward,
showing that if they did not give of their substance to others,
they would not gain anything by gathering all together within.
And he adduces an ancient story, thus saying,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xvii-p39"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 8.15" id="v.xvii-p39.1" parsed="|2Cor|8|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.8.15">Ver. 15</scripRef>. “As it is written, He
that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little
had no lack.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xvii-p40">Now this happened in the case of the manna. For
both they that gathered more, and they that gathered less, were
found to have the same quantity, God in this way punishing
insatiableness. And this he said at once both to alarm them by
what then happened, and to persuade them never to desire to have
more nor to grieve at having less. And this one may see happening
now in things of this life not in the manna only. For if we all
fill but one belly, and live the same length of time, and clothe
one body; neither will the rich gain aught by his abundance nor the
poor lose aught by his poverty.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xvii-p41">[3.] Why then tremblest thou at poverty? and why
pursuest thou after wealth? ‘I fear,’ saith one, ‘lest I be
compelled to go to other men’s doors and to beg from my
neighbor.’ And I constantly hear also many praying to this
effect, and saying, ‘Suffer me not at any time to stand in need
of men?’ And I laugh exceedingly when I hear these prayers, for
this fear is even childish. For every day and in every thing, so
to speak, do we stand in need of one another. So that these are
the words of an unthinking and puffed up spirit, and that doth not
clearly discern the nature of things. Seest thou not that all of
us are in need one of another? The soldier of the artisan, the
artisan of the merchant, the merchant of the husbandman, the slave
of the free man, the master of the slave, the poor man of the rich,
the rich man of the poor, he that worketh not of him that giveth
alms, he that bestoweth of him that receiveth. For he that
receiveth alms supplieth a very great want, a want greater than
any. For if there were no poor, the greater part of our salvation
would be overthrown, in that we should not have where to bestow our
wealth. So that even the poor man who appears to be more useless
than any is the most useful of any. But if to be in need of
another is disgraceful, it remains to die; for it is not possible
for a man to live who is afraid of this. ‘But,’ saith one,
‘I cannot bear blows arched [in scorn.]’ Why dost thou in
accusing another of arrogance, disgrace thyself by this accusation?
for to be unable to endure the inflation of a proud soul is
arrogant. And why fearest thou these things, and tremblest at
these things, and on account of these things which are worthy of no
account, dreadest poverty also? For if thou be rich, thou <pb n="362" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_362.html" id="v.xvii-Page_362" />wilt stand in need of more, yea
of more and meaner. For just in proportion to thy wealth dost
thou subject thyself to this curse. So ignorant art thou of what
thou prayest when thou askest for wealth in order to be in need of
no man; just as if one having come to a sea, where there is need
both of sailors and a ship and endless stores of outfit, should
pray that he might be in need of nothing at all. For if thou art
desirous of being exceedingly independent of every one, pray for
poverty; and [then] if thou art dependent on any, thou wilt be so
only for bread and raiment; but in the other case thou wilt have
need of others, both for lands, and for houses, and for imposts,
and for wages, and for rank, and for safety, and for honor, and for
magistrates, and those subject to them, both those in the city and
those in the country, and for merchants, and for shopkeepers. Do
you see that those words are words of extreme carelessness? For,
in a word, if to be in need one of another appears to thee a
dreadful thing, [know that] it is impossible altogether to escape
it; but if thou wilt avoid the tumult, (for thou mayest take refuge
in the waveless haven of poverty,) cut off the great tumult of thy
affairs, and deem it not disgraceful to be in need of another; for
this is the doing of God’s unspeakable wisdom. For if we stand
in need one of another, yet even the compulsion of this need
draweth us not together unto love; had we been independent, should
we not have been untamed wild beasts? Perforce and of compulsion
God hath subjected us one to another, and every day we are in
collision<note place="end" n="825" id="v.xvii-p41.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xvii-p42"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xvii-p42.1">σνγκρουόμεθα</span>.</p></note> one with
another. And had He removed this curb, who is there who would
readily have longed after his neighbor’s love? Let us then
neither deem this to be disgraceful, nor pray against it and say,
‘Grant us not to stand in need of any one;’ but let us pray and
say, ‘Suffer us not, when we are in need, to refuse those who are
able to help us.’ It is not the standing in need of others, but
seizing the things of others, that is grievous. But now we have
never prayed in respect to that nor said, ‘Grant me not to covet
other men’s goods;’ but to stand in need, this we think a fit
subject of deprecation<note place="end" n="826" id="v.xvii-p42.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xvii-p43"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xvii-p43.1">ἀ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.xvii-p43.2">πευκταὶον</span>.</p></note>. Yet Paul stood in need many
times, and was not ashamed; nay, even prided himself upon it, and
praised those that had ministered to him, saying, “For ye sent
once and again to my need;” (<scripRef passage="Philip. iv. 16" id="v.xvii-p43.3" parsed="|Phil|4|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Phil.4.16">Philip. iv. 16</scripRef>.) and again, “I robbed other
Churches, taking wages of them that I might minister unto you.”
(<scripRef passage="2 Cor. xi. 8" id="v.xvii-p43.4" parsed="|2Cor|11|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.11.8">2 Cor. xi. 8</scripRef>.) It is no mark therefore of
a generous temper, but of weakness and of a low minded and
senseless spirit, to be ashamed of this. For it is even God’s
decree that we should stand in need one of another. Push not
therefore thy philosophy beyond the mean. ‘But,’ saith one,
‘I cannot bear a man that is entreated often and complieth
not.’ And how shall God bear thee who art entreated by Him, and
yet obeyest not; and entreated too in things that advantage thee? 
“For we are ambassadors on behalf of Christ,” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. v. 20" id="v.xvii-p43.5" parsed="|2Cor|5|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.5.20">2 Cor. v. 20</scripRef>.) saith he, “as though God
were entreating by us; be ye reconciled unto God.” ‘And yet,
I am His servant,’ saith he. And what of that? For when thou,
the servant, art drunken, whilst He, the Master, is hungry and hath
not even necessary food, how shall thy name of servant stand thee
in stead? Nay, this itself will even the more weigh thee down,
when thou indeed abidest in a three-storied dwelling whilst He owns
not even a decent shelter; when thou [liest] upon soft couches
whilst He hath not even a pillow. ‘But,’ saith one, ‘I have
given.’ But thou oughtest not to leave off so doing. For then
only wilt thou have an excuse, when thou hast not what [to give],
when thou possessest nothing; but so long as thou hast, (though
thou have given to ten thousand,) and there be others hungering,
there is no excuse for thee. But when thou both shuttest up corn
and raisest the price, and devisest other unusual tricks of
traffic; what hope of salvation shalt thou have henceforth? Thou
hast been bidden to give freely to the hungry, but thou dost not
give at a suitable price even. He emptied Himself of so great
glory for thy sake, but thou dost not count Him deserving even of a
loaf; but thy dog is fed to fulness whilst Christ wastes with
hunger; and thy servant bursteth with surfeiting whilst thy Lord
and his is in want of necessary food. And how are these the deeds
of friends? “Be reconciled unto God,” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. v. 20" id="v.xvii-p43.6" parsed="|2Cor|5|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.5.20">2 Cor. v. 20</scripRef>.) for these are [the deeds] of
enemies and such as are in hostility.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xvii-p44">[4.] Let us then think with shame on the great
benefits we have already received, the great benefits we are yet to
receive. And if a poor man come to us and beg, let us receive him
with much good will, comforting, raising him up with [our] words,
that we ourselves also may meet with the like, both from God and
from men. “For whatsoever ye would that they should do unto
you, do ye also unto them.” (<scripRef passage="Matt. vii. 12" id="v.xvii-p44.1" parsed="|Matt|7|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.7.12">Matt. vii. 12</scripRef>.) Nothing burdensome,
nothing offensive, doth this law contain. ‘What thou wouldest
receive, that do,’ it saith. The return is equal. And it said
not, ‘what thou wouldest not receive, that do not,’ but what is
more. For that indeed is an abstinence from evil things, but this
is a doing of good things, in which the other is involved. Also
He said not ‘that do ye also wish, but do, to them.’ And what
is the advantage? “This is the Law and 
<pb n="363" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_363.html" id="v.xvii-Page_363" />the Prophets.” Wouldest thou have mercy
shown thee? Then show mercy. Wouldest thou obtain
forgiveness? Then grant it. Wouldest thou not be evil spoken
of? Then speak not evil. Longest thou to receive praise? Then
bestow it. Wouldest thou not be wronged? Then do not thou
plunder. Seest thou how He shows that virtue is natural, and that
we need no external laws nor teachers? For in the things we wish
to receive, or not to receive from our neighbors, we legislate unto
ourselves. So that if thou wouldest not receive a thing, yet
doest it, or if thou wouldest receive it, yet doest it not, thou
art become self-condemned and art henceforth without any excuse, on
the ground of ignorance and of not knowing what ought to be done.
Wherefore, I beseech you, having set up this law in ourselves for
ourselves, and reading this that is written so clearly and
succinctly, let us become such to our neighbors, as we would have
them be to ourselves; that may we both enjoy present immunity<note place="end" n="827" id="v.xvii-p44.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xvii-p45"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xvii-p45.1">ἀ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.xvii-p45.2">δείας</span>.</p></note>, and obtain
the future good things, though the grace and love towards men of
our Lord Jesus Christ, with Whom to the Father, together with the
Holy Spirit, be glory, power, honor, now and for ever, and world

be receivers, gives with the fuller bountifulness. And that this
might be the case then also, hear how he commends those that had
come for this purpose, the first of whom was Titus. Wherefore
also he saith, “But thanks be to God, Which put (literally,
‘gave’) the same earnest care into the heart of Titus.”
What is “the same?” Which he had also in respect to the
Thessalonians, or “the same” with me. And mark here wisdom.
Showing this to be the work of God, he also gives thanks to Him
that gave, so as to incite by this also. ‘For if God stirred
him up and sent him to you, He asks through Him. Think not
therefore that what has happened is of men.’ And whence is it
manifest that God incited him?</p>

our exhortation, but being himself very earnest, he went forth of
his own accord.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xviii-p9">Observe how he also represents him as
fulfilling his own part, and needing no prompting from others.
And having mentioned the grace of God, he doth not leave the whole
to be God’s; again, that by this also he may win them unto
greater love, having said that he was stirred up from himself<note place="end" n="831" id="v.xviii-p9.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xviii-p10"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xviii-p10.1">οἴκοθεν</span>.</p></note> also. For,
“being very earnest, he went forth of his own accord,” ‘he
seized at the thing, he rushed upon the treasure, he considered
your service to be his own advantage; and because he loved you
exceedingly, he needed not the exhortation I gave; but though he
was exhorted by me also, yet it was not by that he was stirred up;
but from himself and by the grace of God.’</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xviii-p11"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 8.18" id="v.xviii-p11.1" parsed="|2Cor|8|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.8.18">Ver. 18</scripRef>. “And we have sent
together with him the brother whose praise in the Gospel is spread
through all the Churches.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xviii-p12">And who is this brother? Some indeed say, Luke,
because of the history which he wrote, but some, Barnabas; for he
calls the unwritten preaching also Gospel. And for what cause
does he not mention their names; whilst he both makes Titus known
(vid. also <scripRef passage="2 Cor. 8.23" id="v.xviii-p12.1" parsed="|2Cor|8|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.8.23">ver. 23</scripRef>.)
by name, and praises him for his cooperation in the Gospel, (seeing
that he was so useful that by reason of his absence even Paul could
do nothing great and noble; for, “because I found not Titus my
brother, I had no relief for my spirit,”—c. 
<scripRef passage="2 Cor. 2.13" id="v.xviii-p12.2" parsed="|2Cor|2|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.2.13">ii. 13</scripRef>.) and for his love towards
them, (for, saith he, “his inward affection is more abundant
towards you;”—c. <scripRef passage="2 Cor. 7.15" id="v.xviii-p12.3" parsed="|2Cor|7|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.7.15">vii. 15</scripRef>.)
and for his zeal in this matter (“for,” he saith, “of his own
accord he went”)? But these he neither equally commends, nor
mentions by name? What then is one to say? Perhaps <pb n="364" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_364.html" id="v.xviii-Page_364" />they did not know them; wherefore he
does not dwell upon their praises because as yet they had had no
experience of them, but only says so much as was sufficient for
their commendation unto them (i.e. the Corinthians,) and to their
escaping all evil suspicion. However, let us see on what score he
eulogizes this man himself also. On what score then does he
eulogize? First, praising him from his preaching; that he not
only preached, but also as he ought, and with the befitting
earnestness. For he said not, ‘he preaches and proclaims the
Gospel,’ but, “whose praise is in the Gospel.” And that he
may not seem to flatter him, he brings not one or two or three men,
but whole Churches to testify to him, saying, “through all the
churches.” Then he makes him respected also from the judgment
of those that had chosen him. And this too is no light matter.
Therefore after saying, “Whose praise in the Gospel is spread
through all the churches,” he added,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xviii-p13"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 8.19" id="v.xviii-p13.1" parsed="|2Cor|8|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.8.19">Ver. 19</scripRef>. “And not only so.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xviii-p14">What is, “and not only so?” ‘Not only on
this account,’ he says, ‘is respect due to him, that he is
approved as a preacher and is praised by all.’</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xviii-p15">“But he was also appointed by the churches along
with us.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xviii-p16">Whence it seems to me, that Barnabas is the person
intimated. And he signifies his dignity to be great, for he shows
also for what office he was appointed. For he saith,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xviii-p17">“To travel with us in the matter of this grace
which is ministered by us.” Seest thou how great are these
praises of him? He shone as a preacher of the Gospel and had all
the churches testifying to this. He was chosen by us; and unto
the same office with Paul, and everywhere was partner with him,
both in his trials and in his dangers, for this is implied in the
word “travel.” But what is, “with this grace which is
ministered by us?” So as to proclaim the word, he means, and to
preach the Gospel; or to minister also in respect of the money; yea
rather, he seems to me to refer to both of these. Then he
adds,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xviii-p18">“To the glory of the same Lord, and to show
your readiness<note place="end" n="832" id="v.xviii-p18.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xviii-p19"> [The Rev. Vers. adopts a reading which omits
<i>same</i> before Lord’s, and puts <i>our</i> for <i>
your</i>.]</p></note>.” What
he means is this: ‘We thought good,’ he says, ‘that he
should be chosen with us and be appointed unto this work, so as to
become a dispenser and a minister of the sacred money.’ Nor was
this a little matter. For, “Look ye out,” it saith, “from
among you seven men of good report;” (<scripRef passage="Acts vi. 3" id="v.xviii-p19.1" parsed="|Acts|6|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.6.3">Acts vi. 3</scripRef>.) and he was chosen by
the churches, and there was a vote of the whole people taken.
What is, “to the glory of the same Lord, and your readiness?”
‘That both God may be glorified and ye may become the readier,
they who are to receive this money being of proved character, and
no one<note place="end" n="833" id="v.xviii-p19.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xviii-p20"> Or ‘nothing.’</p></note> able to
engender any false suspicion against them. Therefore we sought
out such persons, and entrusted not the whole to one person only,
that he might escape this suspicion also; but we sent both Titus
and another with him. Then to interpret this same expression,
“to the glory of the Lord and your ready mind:” he
added,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xviii-p21"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 8.20" id="v.xviii-p21.1" parsed="|2Cor|8|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.8.20">Ver. 20</scripRef>. “Avoiding this, that any
man should blame us in the matter of this bounty which is
ministered by us.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xviii-p22">What can this be which is said? A thing worthy of
the virtue of Paul; and showing the greatness of his tender care
and his condescension. ‘For,’ he says, ‘that none should
suspect us, nor have the slightest cavil against us, as though we
purloined aught of the money placed in our hands; therefore we send
such persons, and not one only, but even two or three.’ Seest
thou how he clears them of all suspicions? Not on account of the
Gospel, nor of their having been chosen merely; but also, from
their being persons of proved character, (and for this very reason)
having been chosen, that they might not be suspected. And he said
not ‘that ye should not blame,’ but ‘that no other person
should.’ And yet it was on their account that he did this; and
he implied as much in saying, “to the glory of the same Lord, and
your readiness:” however, he does not wish to wound them; and
so expresses himself differently,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xviii-p23">“Avoiding this.” And he is not satisfied with
this either, but by what he adds, soothes again, saying,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xviii-p24">“In the matter of this bounty which is
ministered by us,” and mingling his severity with praise. For
that they might not feel hurt, and say, ‘Is he obliged then to
eye us stealthily, and are we so miserable as ever to have been
suspected of these things?’ Providing a correction against this
too, he says, ‘the money sent by you is of large amount, and this
abundance, that is, the large amount of the money, is enough to
afford suspicion to the evil-minded had we not offered that
security<note place="end" n="834" id="v.xviii-p24.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xviii-p25"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xviii-p25.1">τὴν ἀσφαλείαν</span>.</p></note>.’</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xviii-p26"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 8.21" id="v.xviii-p26.1" parsed="|2Cor|8|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.8.21">Ver. 21</scripRef>. For “we take thought for
things, honorable not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in
the sight of men.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xviii-p27">What can compare with Paul? For he said not,
‘Perdition and woe to him who chooses to suspect anything of the
kind: so long as my conscience does not condemn me, I waste not a
<pb n="365" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_365.html" id="v.xviii-Page_365" />thought on those who
suspect.’ Rather, the weaker they were, the more he
condescended. For it is meet not to be angry with, but help, him
that is sick. And yet from what sin are we so removed as he was
from any such suspicion? For not even a demon could have
suspected that blessed saint of this unfaithfulness. But still
although so far removed from that evil suspicion, he does
everything and resorts to every expedient<note place="end" n="835" id="v.xviii-p27.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xviii-p28"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xviii-p28.1">πραγματεύεται</span>.</p></note>, so as not to leave a shadow even

he avoids not only accusations, but also blame and the slightest
censure, even bare suspicion.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xviii-p30">[2.] <scripRef passage="2 Cor. 8.22" id="v.xviii-p30.1" parsed="|2Cor|8|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.8.22">Ver. 22</scripRef>. “And we have sent with

<p class="c19" id="v.xviii-p31">Behold, again he adds yet another, and him also with

<p class="c19" id="v.xviii-p32">“Whom,” saith he, “we have many times proved
earnest in many things, but now much more earnest.” And having
praised him from his own good works, he extols him also from his
love towards them; and what he said of Titus, that “being very
earnest he went forth of his own accord;” this he says of this
person also, saying, “but now much more earnest;” laying up
beforehand for them the seeds of [the proof of their] love toward
the Corinthians.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xviii-p33">And then, after having showed forth their virtue, he
exhorts them also on their behalf, saying,</p>

about Titus; he is my partner and my fellow-worker to

<p class="c19" id="v.xviii-p35">What is, “Whether about Titus?”
‘If,’ says he, ‘it be necessary to say any thing, this I have
to say,’ “that he is my partner and fellow-worker to
youward.” For he either means this; or, ‘if ye will do
anything for Titus, ye will do it unto no ordinary person, for he
is “my partner.”’ And whilst appearing to be praising him,
he magnifies them, showing them to be so disposed towards himself
as that it were sufficient ground of honor amongst them that any
one should appear to be his “partner.” But, nevertheless, he
was not content with this, but he also added another thing, saying,
“fellow-worker to youward.” Not merely “fellow-worker,”
‘but in matters concerning you, in your progress, in your growth,
in our friendship, in our zeal for you;’ which last would avail
most especially to endear<note place="end" n="837" id="v.xviii-p35.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xviii-p36"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xviii-p36.1">οἰκειῶσαι</span>.</p></note> him unto them.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xviii-p37">“Or our brethren:” ‘or whether you wish,’
he says, ‘to hear any thing about the others: they too have
great claims to be commended to you. For they also,’ he saith,
‘are our brethren, and,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xviii-p38">“The messengers of the Churches,”’ that is,
sent by the Churches. Then, which is greater than all,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xviii-p39">“The glory of Christ;” for to Him is referred
whatever shall be done to them. ‘Whether then ye wish to
receive them as brethren, or as Apostles of the Churches, or as
acting for the glory of Christ; ye have many motives for good will
towards them. For on behalf of Titus, I have to say, that he is
both “my partner,” and a lover of you; on behalf of these, that
they are “brethren,” that they are “the messengers of the
churches,” that they are “the glory of Christ.” Seest thou
that it is plain from hence also, that they were of such as were
unknown to them?  For otherwise he would have set them off by
those things with which he had also set off Titus, namely, his love
towards them. But whereas as yet they were not known to them,
‘Receive them,’ he says, ‘as brethren, as messengers of the
churches, as acting for the glory of Christ.’ On which account
he adds;</p>

will show, if ye show forth love towards them.’ Then he also
makes his words more solemn, by saying, “unto the person of the
churches.” He means, to the glory, the honor, of the
churches. ‘For if ye honor them, ye have honored the churches
that sent them. For the honor passeth not to them alone, but also
to those that sent them forth, who ordained them, and more than
these, unto the glory of God.’ For when we honor those that
minister to Him, the kind reception<note place="end" n="839" id="v.xviii-p42.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xviii-p43"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xviii-p43.1">τὰ τῆς εὐφημίας</span>.</p></note> passeth unto Him, unto the common
body of the churches. Now this too is no light thing, for great
is the potency of that assembly.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xviii-p44">[3.] Certain it is at least that the prayer of the
churches loosed Peter from his chains, opened the mouth of Paul;
their voice in no slight degree equips those that arrive unto
spiritual rule. Therefore indeed it is that both he who is going
to ordain calleth at that time for their prayers also, and that
they add their votes and assent by acclamations which the initiated
know: for it is not lawful before the uninitiated to unbare all
things. But there are occasions in which there is no difference
at all between the priest and those under him; for instance, when
we are <pb n="366" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_366.html" id="v.xviii-Page_366" />to partake<note place="end" n="840" id="v.xviii-p44.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xviii-p45"> Literally, ‘enjoy.’</p></note> of the awful
mysteries; for we are all alike counted worthy of the same
things: not as under the Old Testament [when] the priest ate some
things and those under him others, and it was not lawful for the
people to partake of those things whereof the priest partook. But
not so now, but before all one body is set and one cup. And in
the prayers also, one may observe the people contributing much.
For in behalf of the possessed, in behalf of those under penance,
the prayers are made in common both by the priest and by them; and
all say one prayer, the prayer replete with pity. Again when we
exclude from the holy precincts those who are unable to partake of
the holy table, it behoveth that another prayer be offered, and we
all alike fall upon the ground, and all alike rise up. Again, in
the most awful mysteries themselves, the priest prays for the
people and the people also pray for the priest; for the words,
“with thy spirit,” are nothing else than this. The offering
of thanksgiving again is common: for neither doth he give thanks
alone, but also all the people. For having first taken their
voices, next when they assent that it is “meet and right so to
do,” then he begins the thanksgiving. And why marvellest thou
that the people any where utter aught with the priest, when indeed
even with the very Cherubim, and the powers above, they send up in
common those sacred hymns? Now I have said all this in order that
each one of the laity also may be wary<note place="end" n="841" id="v.xviii-p45.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xviii-p46"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xviii-p46.1">νήφῃ</span>.</p></note>, that we may understand that we are
all one body, having such difference amongst ourselves as members
with members; and may not throw the whole upon the priests but
ourselves also so care for the whole Church as for a body common to
us. For this course will provide for our<note place="end" n="842" id="v.xviii-p46.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xviii-p47"> The reading of this passage has for the first time
been rendered sound by Mr. Field’s labors.</p></note> greater safety, and for your
greater growth unto virtue. Here, at least, in the case of the
Apostles, how frequently they admitted the laity to share in their
decisions. For when they ordained the seven, (<scripRef passage="Acts vi. 2, 3" id="v.xviii-p47.1" parsed="|Acts|6|2|6|3" osisRef="Bible:Acts.6.2-Acts.6.3">Acts vi. 2, 3</scripRef>.) they first communicated with
the people; and when Peter ordained Matthias, with all that were
then present, both men and women. (<scripRef passage="Acts i. 15" id="v.xviii-p47.2" parsed="|Acts|1|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.1.15">Acts i. 15</scripRef>, &amp;c.) For here<note place="end" n="843" id="v.xviii-p47.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.xviii-p48"> i.e., in the Church.</p></note> is no pride
of rulers nor slavishness in the ruled; but a spiritual rule, in
this particular usurping<note place="end" n="844" id="v.xviii-p48.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xviii-p49"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xviii-p49.1">πλεονεκτοῦσα</span>.</p></note> most, in taking on itself the
greater share of the labor and of the care which is on your behalf,
not in seeking larger honors. For so ought the Church to dwell as
one house; as one body so to be all disposed; just as therefore
there is both one Baptism, and one table, and one fountain, and one
creation, and one Father. Why then are we divided, when so
great<note place="end" n="845" id="v.xviii-p49.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xviii-p50"> Or, so many.</p></note> things unite
us; why are we torn asunder? For we are compelled again to bewail
the same things, which I have lamented often. The state in which
we are calls for lamentation; so widely are we severed from each
other, when we ought to image the conjunction<note place="end" n="846" id="v.xviii-p50.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xviii-p51"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xviii-p51.1">συνάφειαν</span>.</p></note> of one body. For in this way will
he that is greater, be able to gain even from him that is less.
For if Moses learnt from his father-in-law somewhat expedient which
himself had not perceived, (<scripRef passage="Exod. xviii. 14" id="v.xviii-p51.2" parsed="|Exod|18|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Exod.18.14">Exod. xviii. 14</scripRef>, &amp;c.) much more in
the Church may this happen. And how then came it that what he
that was an unbeliever perceived, he that was spiritual perceived
not? That all those of that time might understand that he was a
man; and though he divide the sea, though he cleave the rock, he
needeth the influence of God, and that those acts were not of
man’s nature, but of God’s power. And so let another rise up
and speak; and so now, if such and such an one doth not say
expedient things, let another rise up and speak; though he be an
inferior, yet if he say somewhat to the purpose<note place="end" n="847" id="v.xviii-p51.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.xviii-p52"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xviii-p52.1">τῶν συντελούντων</span>.</p></note>, confirm his opinion; and even if
he be of the very meanest, do not show him disrespect. For no one
of these is at so great a distance from his neighbor, as Moses’
father-in-law was from him, yet he disdained not to listen to him,
but even admitted his opinion, and was persuaded, and recorded it;
and was not ashamed to hand down the circumstances to history;
casting down [so] the pride of the many. Wherefore also he left
this story to the world<note place="end" n="848" id="v.xviii-p52.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xviii-p53"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xviii-p53.1">τῷ βίῳ</span>.

for he knew that it would be useful to many. Let us then not
overlook those who give us behoveful counsel, even though they be
of the meaner sort, nor insist that those counsels prevail which we
have ourselves introduced; but whatever shall appear to be best,
let that be approved by all. For many of duller sight have
perceived things sooner than those of acute vision, by means of
diligence and attention. And say not, “why dost thou call me to
council, if thou hearkenest not to what I say?” These
accusations are not a counsellor’s, but a despot’s. For the
counsellor hath only power to speak his own opinion; but if
something else appear more profitable, and yet he will carry his
own opinion into effect, he is no longer a counsellor but a despot,
as I said. Let us not, then, act in this manner; but having freed
our souls from all arrogancy and pride, let us consider, not how
our counsels only may stand, but how that opinion which is best may
prevail, even though it may not have been 
<pb n="367" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_367.html" id="v.xviii-Page_367" />brought forward by us. For no light gain
will be ours, even though we should not have discovered what
behoveth, if ourselves accepted what has been pointed out by
others; and abundant is the reward we shall receive from God, and
so too shall we best attain to glory. For as he is wise that
speaketh that which is behoveful, so shall we that have accepted
it, ourselves also reap the praise of prudence and of candor.
Thus if both houses and states, thus too if the Church be ordered,
she will receive a larger increase<note place="end" n="849" id="v.xviii-p53.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.xviii-p54"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xviii-p54.1">οἰκονομουμένη</span>.</p></note>; and so too shall we ourselves,
having thus best ordered our present lives, receive the good things
to come: whereunto may we all attain, through the grace and love
towards men of our Lord Jesus Christ, to Whom be glory for ever and
ever. Amen.</p>

<p class="c27" id="v.xix-p3">For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is
superfluous for me to write to you.</p>

<p class="c24" id="v.xix-p4"><span class="c18" id="v.xix-p4.1">Though</span> he had said so much
about it, he says here, “It is superfluous for me to write to
you.” And his wisdom is shown not only in this, that though he
had said so much about it, he saith, “it is superfluous for me to
write to you,” but in that he yet again speaketh of it. For
what he said indeed a little above, he said concerning those who
received the money, to ensure them the enjoyment of great honor: 
but what he said before that, (his account of the Macedonians, that
“their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their
liberality,” and all the rest,) was concerning loving-kindness
and almsgiving. But nevertheless even though he had said so much
before and was going to speak again, he says, “it is superfluous
for me to write to you.” And this he does the rather to win
them to himself. For a man who has so high a reputation as not to
stand in need even of advice, is ashamed to appear inferior to, and
come short of, that opinion of him. And he does this often in
accusation also, using the rhetorical figure, omission, for this is
very effective. For the judge seeing the magnanimity of the
accuser entertains no suspicions even. For he argues, ‘he who
when he might say much, yet saith it not, how should he invent what
is not true?’ And he gives occasion to suspect even more than
he says, and invests himself with the presumption of a good
disposition. This also in his advice and in his praises he
does. For having said, “It is superfluous for me to write to
you,” observe how he advises them.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xix-p5">“For I know your readiness of which I glory on
your behalf to them of Macedonia.” Now it was a great thing
that he even knew it himself, but much greater, that he also
published it to others: for the force it has is greater: for
they would not like to be so widely disgraced. Seest thou his
wisdom of purpose? He exhorted them by others’ example, the
Macedonians, for, he says, “I make known to you the grace of God
which hath been given in the Churches of Macedonia.” He
exhorted them by their own, for he saith, “who were the first to
make a beginning a year ago not only to do, but also to will.”
He exhorted them by the Lord’s, for “ye know” he saith,
“the grace of our Lord, that though He was rich, yet for our
sakes He became poor.” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. 8.9" id="v.xix-p5.1" parsed="|2Cor|8|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.8.9">ibid. 9</scripRef>.) Again he retreats upon
that strong main point, the conduct of others.  For mankind is
emulous. And truly the example of the Lord ought to have had most
power to draw them over: and next to it, the [consideration] of
the recompense: but because they were somewhat weak, this draws
them most. For nothing does so much as emulation. But observe
how he introduces it in a somewhat novel way. For He did not say,
‘Imitate them;’ but what?</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xix-p6">“And your zeal has stirred up very many.” What
sayest thou? A little before thou saidst, [they did it] “of
their own accord, beseeching us with much entreaty,” how then
now, “your zeal?” ‘Yes,’ he saith, ‘we did not advise,
we did not exhort, but we only praised you, we only boasted of you,
and this was enough to incite them.” Seest thou how he rouses
them each by the other, these by those, and those by these, and,
along with the emulation, has intermingled also a very high
encomium. Then, that he may not elate them, he follows it up in a
tempered tone, saying, “Your zeal hath stirred up very many.”
Now consider what a thing it is that those who have been the
occasion to others of this munificence, should be themselves behind
hand in this contribution. Therefore he did not say, ‘Imitate
them,’ for it would not have kindled so great an emulation, but
how? ‘They <pb n="368" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_368.html" id="v.xix-Page_368" />have imitated
you; see then that ye the teachers appear not inferior to your
disciples.’</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xix-p7">And see how, whilst stirring up and inflaming them
still more, he feigns to be standing by them, as if espousing their
party in some rivalry and contention. For, as he said above,
“Of their own accord, with much entreaty they came to us,
insomuch that we exhorted Titus, that as he had made a beginning
before, so he would complete this grace;” so also he says
here,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xix-p8"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 9.3" id="v.xix-p8.1" parsed="|2Cor|9|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.9.3">Ver. 3</scripRef>.
“For this cause have I sent the brethren that our glorying on
your behalf may not be made void.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xix-p9">Seest thou that he is in anxiety and terror,
lest he should seem to have said what he said only for
exhortation’s sake? ‘But because so it is,’ saith he, “I
have sent the brethren;” ‘so earnest am I on your behalf,’
“that our glorying may not be made void.” And he appears to
make himself of the Corinthians’ party throughout, although
caring for all alike. What he says is this; ‘I am very proud of
you, I glory before all, I boasted even unto them<note place="end" n="850" id="v.xix-p9.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xix-p10"> i.e. them of Macedonia.</p></note>, so that if ye be found wanting, I
am partner in the shame.’ And this indeed he says under
limitation, for he added,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xix-p11">“In this respect,” not, in all points;</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xix-p12">“That even as I said, ye may be prepared.”
‘For I did not say, ‘they are purposing,’ but ‘all is
ready; and nothing is now wanting on their part. This then,’ he
says, ‘I wish to be shown by your deeds.’ Then he even
heightens the anxiety, saying,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xix-p13"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 9.4" id="v.xix-p13.1" parsed="|2Cor|9|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.9.4">Ver. 4</scripRef>.
“Lest by any means if there come with me any from Macedonia, we,
(that we say not ye,) should be put to shame in this
confidence.” The shame is greater when the spectators he has
arrayed against them are many, even those same persons who had
heard [his boasting.] And he did not say, ‘for I am bringing
with me Macedonians;’ ‘for there are Macedonians coming with
me;’ lest he should seem to do it on purpose; but how [said
he?] “Lest by any means, if there come with me any from
Macedonia?” ‘For this may happen,’ he says, ‘it is matter
of possibility.’ For thus he also made what he said
unsuspected, but had he expressed himself in that other way, he
would have even made them the more contentious. See how he leads
them on, not from spiritual motives only, but from human ones as
well. ‘For,’ says he, ‘though you make no great account of
me, and reckon confidently on my excusing you, yet think of them of
Macedonia,’ “lest by any means, if they come and find you;”
and he did not say ‘unwillingly,’ but “unprepared,” not
having got all completed. But if this be a disgrace, not to
contribute quickly; consider how great it were to contribute either
not at all, or less than behoved. Then he lays down what would
thereupon follow, in terms at once gentle and pungent, thus saying,
“We, (that we say not ye,) should be put to shame.” And he
tempers it again, saying, “in this confidence” not as making
them more listless, but as showing that they who were approved in
all other respects, ought in this one also to have great
fearlessness.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xix-p14">[2.] <scripRef passage="2 Cor. 9.5" id="v.xix-p14.1" parsed="|2Cor|9|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.9.5">Ver. 5</scripRef>. “I thought it
necessary therefore to entreat the brethren, that they would make
up beforehand this your bounty, that the same might be ready, as a
matter of bounty and not of extortion.<note place="end" n="851" id="v.xix-p14.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xix-p15"> This verse, as given by Chrysostom, varies somewhat
from the Received Text.</p></note>”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xix-p16">Again, he resumed the subject in a different
manner: and that he may not seem to be saying these things without
object, he asserts that the sole reason for this journey was, that
they might not be put to shame. Seest thou how his words, “It
is superfluous for me to write,” were the beginning of
advising? You see, at least, how many things he discourses
concerning this ministering. And along with this, one may further
remark that, (lest he should seem to contradict himself as having
said, “It is superfluous,” yet discoursing at length about it,)
he passed on unto discourse of quickness and largeness and
forwardness [in contributing,] by this means securing that point
also. For these three things he requires. And indeed he moved
these three main points even at the first, for when he says, “In
much proof of affliction the abundance of their joy, and their deep
poverty, abounded unto the riches of their liberality,” he says
nothing else than that they contributed both much and gladly and
quickly; and that not only did not giving much pain them, but not
even being in trials, which is more grievous than giving. And the
words, “they gave themselves to us;” these also show both their
forwardness and the greatness of their faith. And here too again
he treats of those heads. For since these are opposed to [each
other,] munificence and forwardness, and one that has given much is
often sorrowful, whilst another, that he may not be sorry, gives
less; observe how he takes care for each, and with the wisdom which
belongs to him. For he did not say, ‘it is better to give a
little and of free choice, than much of necessity;’ because he
wished them to contribute both much and of free choice; but how
saith he? “that they might make up beforehand this your bounty,
that the same might be ready as a matter of bounty<note place="end" n="852" id="v.xix-p16.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xix-p17"> A <i>blessing</i>, <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xix-p17.1"> εὐλογὶαν</span>.</p></note>, and not
extortion. He 
<pb n="369" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_369.html" id="v.xix-Page_369" />begins first with that which is pleasantest
and lighter; namely, the ‘not of necessity,’ for, it is
“bounty” he says. Observe how in the form of his exhortation
he represents at once the fruit as springing up, and the givers as
filled with blessing. And by the term employed he won them over,
for no one gives a blessing with pain. Yet neither was he content
with this; but added, “not as of extortion.” ‘Think not,’
he says, ‘that we take it as extortioners, but that we may be the
cause of a blessing unto you.’ For extortion belongs to the
unwilling, so that whoso giveth alms unwillingly giveth of
extortion.<note place="end" n="853" id="v.xix-p17.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xix-p18"> Literally, <i>giveth
extortion</i>.</p></note>  Then from
this he passed on again unto that, the giving
munificently.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xix-p19"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 9.6" id="v.xix-p19.1" parsed="|2Cor|9|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.9.6">Ver. 6</scripRef>.
“But this I say:”  that is, along with this I say also that.
What?</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xix-p20">“He that soweth sparingly, shall reap also
sparingly; and he that soweth bountifully shall reap also
bountifully.” And he did not say niggardly, but a milder
expression, employing the name of the sparing.  And he called the
thing sowing; that thou mightest at once look unto the recompense,
and having in mind the harvest, mightest feel that thou receivest
more than thou givest. Wherefore he did not say, ‘He that
giveth,’ but “He that soweth:” and he said not ‘ye, if ye
sow,’ but made what he said general. Neither did he say,
‘largely,’ but “bountifully,” which is far greater than
this. And again, he betakes himself to that former point of
gladness; saying,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xix-p21"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 9.7" id="v.xix-p21.1" parsed="|2Cor|9|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.9.7">Ver. 7</scripRef>.
“Let each man do according as he hath purposed in his heart.”
For a man when left to himself, does a thing more readily than when
compelled. Wherefore also he dwells upon this: for having said,
“according as he is disposed,” he added,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xix-p22">“Not grudgingly, nor of necessity.” And
neither was he content with this, but he adds a testimony from
Scripture also, saying,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xix-p23">“For God loveth a cheerful giver.” Seest
thou how frequently he lays this down? “I speak not by
commandment:” and, “Herein I give my advice:” and, “as
a matter of bounty, and not as of extortion,” and again, “not
grudgingly, nor of necessity; for God loveth a cheerful giver.”
In this passage I am of opinion that a large [giver] is intended;
the Apostle however has taken it as giving with readiness. For
because the example of the Macedonians and all those other things
were enough to produce sumptuousness, he does not say many things
on that head, but upon giving without reluctance. For if it is a
work of virtue, and yet all that is done of necessity is shorn of
its reward<note place="end" n="854" id="v.xix-p23.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xix-p24"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xix-p24.1">ὑ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.xix-p24.2">ποτέμνεται</span>.</p></note>, with reason
also he labors at this point. And he does not advise merely, but
also adds a prayer, as his wont is to do, saying,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xix-p25"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 9.8" id="v.xix-p25.1" parsed="|2Cor|9|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.9.8">Ver. 8</scripRef>. “And may God<note place="end" n="855" id="v.xix-p25.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xix-p26"> A.V. “God is able to, &amp;c.” [which gives the
true text. C.]</p></note>, that is
able, fulfill all grace towards you.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xix-p27">By this prayer he takes out the way a thought
which lay in wait against<note place="end" n="856" id="v.xix-p27.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xix-p28"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xix-p28.1">ὐ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.xix-p28.2">φορμοῦντα</span>.</p></note> this liberality and which is now
also an hinderance to many. For many persons are afraid to give
alms, saying, ‘Lest perchance I become poor,’ ‘lest perchance
I need aid from others.’ To do away with this fear then, he
adds this prayer, saying, May “He make all grace abound towards
you.” Not merely fulfil, but “make it abound.” And what
is “make grace abound?” ‘Fill you,’ he means, ‘with so
great things, that ye may be able to abound in this
liberality.’</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xix-p29">“That ye, having always all sufficiency in every
thing, may abound to every good work.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xix-p30">Observe, even in this his prayer, his great
philosophy. He prays not for riches nor for abundance, but for
all sufficiency. Nor is this all that is admirable in him; but
that as he prayed not for superfluity, so he doth not press sore on
them nor compel them to give of their want, condescending to their
weakness; but asks for a “sufficiency,” and shows at the same
time that they ought not to abuse the gifts received from God.
“That ye may abound,” he saith, “to every good work.”
‘It is therefore,’ saith he, ‘I ask for this, that ye may
bestow on others also.’ Yet he did not say, ‘bestow,’ but
‘abound.’ For in carnal things he asks for a sufficiency for
them, but in spiritual things for abundance even; not in almsgiving
only, but in all other things also, “unto every good work.”
Then he brings forward unto them the prophet for a counsellor,
having sought out a testimony inviting them to bountifulness, and
says,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xix-p31"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 9.9" id="v.xix-p31.1" parsed="|2Cor|9|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.9.9">Ver. 9</scripRef>.
“As it is written,</p>

<p class="c31" id="v.xix-p33">His righteousness abideth for ever.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xix-p34">This is the import of “abound;” for the words,
“he hath dispersed abroad,” signify nothing else but the giving
plentifully. For if the things themselves abide not, yet their
results abide. For this is the thing to be admired, that when
they are kept they are lost; but when dispersed abroad they abide,
yea, abide for ever. Now by “righteousness,” here, he means
love towards men. For this maketh righteous, consuming sins like
a fire when it is plentifully poured out.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xix-p35">[3.] Let us not therefore nicely calculate, but

players and harlots? Give at any rate the half to Christ, of what
they give to dancers. As much as they give of ostenta<pb n="370" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_370.html" id="v.xix-Page_370" />tion to those upon the stage,
so much at any rate give thou unto the hungry. For they indeed

with a threadbare garment the flesh of Christ, and that though
beholding it naked. What forgiveness doth this deserve, yea, how
great a punishment doth it not deserve, when he indeed bestoweth so
much upon her that ruineth and shameth him, but thou not the least
thing on Him that saveth thee and maketh thee brighter? But as
long as thou spendest it upon thy belly and on drunkenness and
dissipation<note place="end" n="858" id="v.xix-p36.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.xix-p37"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xix-p37.1">ἀ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.xix-p37.2">σωτίαν</span>.</p></note>, thou never
thinkest of poverty: but when need is to relieve poverty, thou
art become poorer than any body. And when feeding parasites and
flatterers, thou art as joyous as though thou hadst fountains to
spend from<note place="end" n="859" id="v.xix-p37.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.xix-p38"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xix-p38.1">ἀπὸ

chance to see a poor man, then the fear of poverty besets thee.
Therefore surely we shall in that day be condemned, both by
ourselves and by others, both by those that have done well and
those that have done amiss. For He will say to thee, ‘Wherefore
wast thou not thus magnanimous in things where it became thee? 
But here is a man who, when giving to an harlot, thought not of any
of these things; whilst thou, bestowing upon thy Master Who hath
bid thee “not be anxious” (<scripRef passage="Matt. vi. 25" id="v.xix-p38.2" parsed="|Matt|6|25|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.6.25">Matt. vi. 25</scripRef>.), art full of fear and
trembling.’ And what forgiveness then shalt thou deserve? For
if a man who hath received will not overlook, but will requite the
favor, much more will Christ. For He that giveth even without
receiving, how will He not give after receiving? ‘What then,’
saith one, ‘when some who have spent much come to need other
men’s help?’ Thou speakest of those that have spent their
all; when thou thyself bestowest not a farthing. Promise to strip
thyself of every thing and then ask questions about such men; but
as long as thou art a niggard and bestowest little of thy
substance, why throw me out excuses and pretenses? For neither am
I leading thee to the lofty peak of entire poverty<note place="end" n="860" id="v.xix-p38.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.xix-p39"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xix-p39.1">ἀ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.xix-p39.2">κτημοσύνης</span>.</p></note> but for the
present I require thee to cut off superfluities and to desire a
sufficiency alone. Now the boundary of sufficiency is the using
those things which it is impossible to live without. No one
debars thee from these; nor forbids thee thy daily food. I say
food, not feasting; raiment, not ornament<note place="end" n="861" id="v.xix-p39.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.xix-p40"> Chrys. <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xix-p40.1">τροφὴν, οὐ τρυφὴν
λέγω.  σκεπάσματα, οὐ καλλωπισματα</span>, with a manifest play
on the words.</p></note>. Yea rather, if one should
enquire accurately, this is in the best sense feasting. For,
consider. Which should we say more truly feasted, he whose diet
was herbs, and who was in sound health and suffered no
uneasiness: or he who had the table of a Sybarite, and was full
of ten thousand disorders? Very plainly the former. Therefore
let us seek nothing more than this, if we would at once live
luxuriously and healthfully: and let us set these boundaries to
sufficiency. And let him that can be satisfied with pulse and can
keep in good health, seek for nothing more; but let him who is
weaker and requires to be dieted with garden herbs, not be hindered
of this. But if any be even weaker than this and require the
support of flesh in moderation, we will not debar him from this
either. For we do not advise these things, to kill and injure men
but to cut off what is superfluous; and that is superfluous which
is more than we need. For when we are able even without a thing
to live healthfully and respectably, certainly the addition of that
thing is a superfluity.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xix-p41">[4.] Thus let us think also in regard of
clothing and of the table and of a dwelling house and of all our
other wants; and in every thing inquire what is necessary. For
what is superfluous is also useless. When thou shalt have
practised living on what is sufficient; then if thou hast a mind to
emulate that widow, we will lead thee on to greater things than
these. For thou hast not yet attained to the philosophy of that
woman, whilst thou art anxious about what is sufficient. For she
soared higher even than this; for what was to have been her
support; that she cast in, all of it. Wilt thou then still
distress thyself about such things as be necessary; and dost thou
not blush to be vanquished by a woman; and not only not to emulate
her, but to be left even of her far behind? For she did not say
the things we say, ‘But what, if when I have spent all I be
compelled to beg of another?’ but in her munificence stripped
herself of all she had. What shall we say of the widow in the Old
Testament in the time of the prophet Elias? For the risk she ran
was not of poverty, but even of death and extinction, and not her
own only, but her children’s too. For neither had she any
expectation of receiving from others, but of presently dying.
‘But,’ saith one, ‘she saw the prophet, and that made her
munificent.’ But do not ye see saints without number? And why
do I speak of saints? Ye see the Lord of the prophets asking an
alms, and yet not even so do ye become humane; but though ye have
coffers spewing<note place="end" n="862" id="v.xix-p41.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xix-p42"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xix-p42.1">ἐ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.xix-p42.2">ρευγόμενα</span>.</p></note> one into
another, do not even impart of your superfluity. What sayest
thou? Was he a prophet that came to her, and did this persuade
her to so great a magnanimity? This of itself deserves much
admiration, that she was persuaded of his being a great and
wonderful person. For how was it she did not say, as it would
have been <pb n="371" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_371.html" id="v.xix-Page_371" />likely
that a barbarian woman and a foreigner would have reasoned, ‘If
he were a prophet, he would not have begged of me. If he were a
friend of God, He would not have neglected him. Be it that
because of sins the Jews suffer this punishment: but whence, and
wherefore, doth this man suffer?’ But she entertained none of
these thoughts; but opened to him her house, and before her house,
her heart; and set before him all she had; and putting nature on
one side and disregarding her children, preferred the stranger unto
all. Consider then how great punishment will be laid up for us,
if we shall come behind<note place="end" n="863" id="v.xix-p42.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.xix-p43"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xix-p43.1">ἔλαττον

widow, poor, a foreigner, a barbarian, a mother of children,
knowing nothing of these things which we know!  For because we
have strength of body, we are not therefore manly persons. For he
alone hath this virtue, yea though he be laid upon his bed, whose
strength is from within; since without this, though a man should
tear up a mountain by his strength of body, I would call him
nothing stronger than a girl or wretched crone. For the one
struggles with incorporeal ills, but the other dares not even look
them in the face. And that thou mayest learn that this is the
measure of manliness, collect it from this very example. For what
could be more manly than that woman who both against the tyranny of
nature, and against the force of hunger, and against the threat of
death, stood nobly fast, and proved stronger than all? Hear at
least how Christ proclaimeth her. For, saith He, “there were
many widows in the days of Elias, and to none of them was the
prophet sent but to her.” (<scripRef passage="Luke iv. 25, 26" id="v.xix-p43.2" parsed="|Luke|4|25|4|26" osisRef="Bible:Luke.4.25-Luke.4.26">Luke iv. 25, 26</scripRef>.) Shall I say something
great and startling? This woman gave more to hospitality, than
our father Abraham. For she “ran” not “unto the herd,” as
he, (<scripRef passage="Gen. xviii. 7" id="v.xix-p43.3" parsed="|Gen|18|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.18.7">Gen. xviii. 7</scripRef>.) but by that “handful”

have been renowned for hospitality. For in this was his
excellence that he set himself to do that office; but hers, in that
for the sake of the stranger she spared not her children even, and
that too, though she looked not for the things to come. But we,
though a heaven exists, though a hell is threatened, though (which
is greater than all) God hath wrought such great things for us and
is made glad and rejoiceth over such things, sink back supinely.<note place="end" n="864" id="v.xix-p43.5"><p class="endnote" id="v.xix-p44"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xix-p44.1">ἀ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.xix-p44.2">ναπεπτώκαμεν</span>.</p></note>  Not so, I
beseech you: but let us “scatter abroad,” let us “give to
the poor” as we ought to give. For what is much and what
little, God defines, not by the measure of what is given, but by
the extent of the substance of him that gives. Often surely hast
thou who didst cast in an hundred staters of gold offered less than
he that offered but one obol, for thou didst cast in of thy
superfluity. Howbeit do if but this, and thou wilt come quickly
even to greater munificence. Scatter wealth that thou mayest
gather righteousness. For along with wealth this refuseth to come
to us; yet through it, though not with it, it is made present to
us. For it is not possible that lust of wealth and righteousness
should dwell together; they have their tents apart. Do not then
obstinately strive to bring things together which are incompatible,
but banish the usurper covetousness, if thou wouldest obtain the
kingdom. For this<note place="end" n="865" id="v.xix-p44.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.xix-p45"> i.e., righteousness. [According to the text which
the Apostle quotes from <scripRef passage="Psalm cxii." id="v.xix-p45.1" parsed="|Ps|112|0|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.112">Psalm cxii.</scripRef>, the abiding of righteousness
forever is God’s reward for scattering. Righteousness here
appears to mean general excellence or virtue as manifested in
beneficence. A parallel use of the term is found in the Sermon on
the Mount where (<scripRef passage="Matth. vi. 1" id="v.xix-p45.2" parsed="|Matt|6|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.6.1">Matth.
vi. 1</scripRef>.) according
to the true text, our Lord in giving general directions about
almsgiving, etc., begins with the injunction, “Take heed that ye
do not your <i>righteousness</i> before men, to be seen of
them.” When therefore it is said in the Psalm that the liberal
man’s righteousness or beneficence shall continue forever, the
implication is that he shall always have the means to continue his
liberality. This is sustained by the tendency of things and by
the general course of Divine Providence. But Chrysostom, while
enforcing the inculcation of beneficence, carries out the spirit of
the Apostle’s utterances, and calls attention not only to the
frequency and amount of one’s gifts but also to the spirit which
prompts them. The mere mechanical view which makes a merit of
voluntary poverty and praises a gift to others without respect to
the motive that prompted it, finds no sanction in the Apostle’s
words or in those of his expounder. C.]</p></note> is the [rightful] queen, and of
slaves makes freemen, the contrary of which the other doth.
Wherefore with all earnestness let us shun the one and welcome the
other, that we may both gain freedom in this life and obtain the
kingdom of heaven, through the grace and love towards men of our
Lord Jesus Christ, with Whom, to the Father together with the Holy
Spirit, be glory, might, honor, now and for ever, and world without
end. Amen.</p>

<p class="c24" id="v.xx-p5"><span class="c18" id="v.xx-p5.1">Herein</span> one may
particularly admire the wisdom of Paul, that after having exhorted
from spiritual considerations and from temporal, in respect of the
recompense also he again does the very same, making the returns he
mentions of either kind. This, (for instance,) “He hath
scattered abroad, he hath given to the poor, his righteousness
abideth for ever,” belongs to a spiritual return; that again,
“multiply your seed for sowing,” to a temporal recompense.
Still, however, he rests not here, but even again passes back to
what is spiritual, placing the two continually side by side; for
“increase the fruits of your righteousness,” is spiritual.
This he does, and gives variety by it to his discourse, tearing up
by the roots those their unmanly and faint-hearted reasonings, and
using many arguments to dissipate their fear of poverty, as also
the example which he now brings. For if even to those that sow
the earth God gives, if to those that feed the body He grants
abundance; much more will He to those who till the soil<note place="end" n="867" id="v.xx-p5.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xx-p6"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xx-p6.1">γεωργοῦσι</span>.</p></note> of heaven,
to those who take care for the soul; for these things He willeth
should yet more enjoy His providing care. However, he does not
state this in the way of inference nor in the manner I have done,
but in the form of a prayer; thus at once making the reference
plain, and the rather leading them on to hope, not only from what
[commonly] takes place, but also from his own prayer: for, ‘May
He minister,’ saith he, ‘and multiply your seed for sowing, and
increase the fruits of your righteousness.’ Here also again he
hints, in an unsuspicious way, at largeness [in giving], for the
words, “multiply and increase,” are by way of indicating this;
and at the same time he allows them to seek for nothing more than
necessaries, saying, “bread for food.” For this also is
particularly worthy of admiration in him, (and it is a point he
successfully established<note place="end" n="868" id="v.xx-p6.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xx-p7"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xx-p7.1">κατεσκεύασεν</span>.</p></note> even before,) namely, that in
things which be necessary, he allows them to seek for nothing more
than need requires; but in spiritual things counsels them to get
for themselves a large superabundance. Wherefore he said above
also, “that having a sufficiency ye may abound to every good
work:” and here, “He that ministereth bread for food,
multiply your seed for sowing;” that is to say, the spiritual
[seed]. For he asks not almsgiving merely, but with largeness.
Wherefore also he continually calls it “seed.” For like as
the corn cast into the ground showeth luxuriant crops, so also many
are the handfuls almsgiving produceth of righteousness, and
unspeakable the fruits it showeth. Then having prayed for great
affluence unto them, he shows again in what they ought to expend
it, saying,</p>

every thing to all liberality, which worketh through us
thanksgiving to God.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xx-p9">Not that ye may consume it upon things not
fitting, but upon such as bring much thanksgiving to God. For God
made us to have the disposal of great things, and reserving to

at our own disposal whether the crops we have to show be
luxuriant. For no need is here of rains and of variety of
seasons, but of the will only, and they run up to heaven itself.
And largeness in giving is what he here calls liberality<note place="end" n="871" id="v.xx-p11.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xx-p12"> Gr. <i>Singleness</i>.</p></note>. “Which
worketh through us thanksgiving to God.” For neither is that
which is done almsgiving merely, but also the ground of much
thanksgiving: yea rather, not of thanksgiving only, but of many
other things besides. And these as he goes on he mentions, that
by showing it to be the cause of many good works, he may make them
thereby the forwarder.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xx-p13">[2.] What then are these many good works? Hear
him saying:</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xx-p14"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 9.12-14" id="v.xx-p14.1" parsed="|2Cor|9|12|9|14" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.9.12-2Cor.9.14">Ver. 12–14</scripRef>. “For the ministration of
this service, not only filleth up the measure of the wants of the
saints, but aboundeth also through 
<pb n="373" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_373.html" id="v.xx-Page_373" />many thanksgivings unto God; seeing that
through the proving<note place="end" n="872" id="v.xx-p14.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xx-p15"> A.V. experiment.</p></note> of you by this ministration, they
glorify God for the obedience of your confession unto the Gospel<note place="end" n="873" id="v.xx-p15.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xx-p16"> Rec. Text. <i>Gospel of
Christ</i>.</p></note>, and for the
liberality of your contribution unto them and unto all; while they
also with supplication on your behalf, long after you by reason of
the exceeding grace of God in you.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xx-p17">What he says is this; ‘in the first place ye not
only supply the wants of the saints, but ye are abundant even;’
that is, ‘ye furnish them with even more than they need: next,
through them ye send up thanksgiving to God, for they glorify Him
for the obedience of your confession.’ For that he may not
represent them as giving thanks on this account solely, (I mean,
because they received somewhat,) see how high-minded he makes them,
exactly as he himself says to the Philippians, “Not that I desire
a gift.” (<scripRef passage="Philip. iv. 17" id="v.xx-p17.1" parsed="|Phil|4|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Phil.4.17">Philip. iv.
17</scripRef>.) ‘To them too I
bear record of the same thing. For they rejoice indeed that ye
supply their wants and alleviate their poverty; but far more, in
that ye are so subjected to the Gospel; whereof this is an
evidence, your contributing so largely.’ For this the Gospel
enjoins.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xx-p18">“And for the liberality of your contribution
unto them and unto all.” ‘And on this account,’ he says,
‘they glorify God that ye are so liberal, not unto them only, but
also unto all.’ And this again is made a praise unto them that
they gave thanks even for that which is bestowed upon others.
‘For,’ saith he, ‘they do honor<note place="end" n="874" id="v.xx-p18.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xx-p19"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xx-p19.1">κοσμοῦσι</span>.</p></note>, not to their own concerns only,
but also to those of others, and this although they are in the
extremest poverty; which is an evidence of their great virtue.
For nothing is so full of envy as the whole race of such as are in
poverty. But they are pure from this passion; being so far from
feeling pained because of the things ye impart to others, that they
even rejoice over it no less than over the things themselves
receive.’</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xx-p20">“While they themselves also with
supplication.” ‘For in respect of these things,’ saith he,
‘they give thanks to God, but in respect of your love and your
coming together, they beseech Him that they may be counted worthy
to see you. For they long after this, not for the money’s sake,
but that they may be witnesses of the grace that hath been bestowed
upon you.’ Seest thou Paul’s wisdom, how after having exalted
them, he ascribed the whole to God by calling the thing
“grace?” For seeing he had spoken great things of them, in
that he called them ministers and exalted them unto a great height,
(since they offered service<note place="end" n="875" id="v.xx-p20.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xx-p21"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xx-p21.1">ἐ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.xx-p21.2">λειτουργοῦν</span>.</p></note> whilst he himself did but

them ‘proved<note place="end" n="877" id="v.xx-p22.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xx-p23"> i.e. In the word, <i>proving</i>.</p></note>,’ he shows
that God was the Author of all these things. And he himself
again, along with them, sends up thanksgiving, saying,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xx-p24"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 9.15" id="v.xx-p24.1" parsed="|2Cor|9|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.9.15">Ver. 15</scripRef>. “Thanks be to God for His
unspeakable gift.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xx-p25">And here he calls “gift,” even those so many
good things which are wrought by almsgiving, both to them that
receive and them that give; or else, those unspeakable good things
which through His advent He gave unto the whole world with great
munificence, which one may suspect to be the most probable. For
that he may at once both sober, and make them more liberal, he puts
them in mind of the benefits they had received from God. For this
avails very greatly in inciting unto all virtue; and therefore he
concluded his discourse with it. But if His Gift be unspeakable,
what can match their frenzy who raise curious questions as to His
Essence? But not only is His Gift unspeakable, but that
“peace” also “passeth all understanding,” (<scripRef passage="Philip. iv. 7" id="v.xx-p25.1" parsed="|Phil|4|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Phil.4.7">Philip. iv. 7</scripRef>.) whereby He reconciled the
things which are above with those which are below.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xx-p26">[3.] Seeing then that we are in the
enjoyment of so great grace, let us strive to exhibit a virtue of
life worthy of it, and to make much account of almsgiving. And
this we shall do, if we shun excess and drunkenness and gluttony.<note place="end" n="878" id="v.xx-p26.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xx-p27"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xx-p27.1">ἁ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.xx-p27.2">δδηφαγίαν</span>.</p></note>  For God
gave meat and drink not for excess, but for nourishment. For it
is not the wine that produceth drunkenness, for if that were the
case, every body would needs be drunken. ‘But,’ saith one,
‘it would be better, if even to drink it largely did not
injure.’ These are drunkards’ words. For if to drink it
largely doth injure, and yet not even so thou desistest from thy
excess in it; if this is so disgraceful and injurious, and yet thou
ceasest not even so from thy depraved longing; if it were possible
both to drink largely and be nothing harmed, where wouldest thou
have stayed in thine excess? Wouldest thou not have longed that
the rivers even might become wine? wouldest thou not have destroyed

overpass we are injured, and yet even so thou canst not bear the
curb, but snapping it as under seizest on what every body else
hath, to minister to the wicked tyranny of this gluttony; what
wouldest thou not have done, if this natural mean were abolished?
wouldest thou not have spent thy whole time upon it? Would it
then have been well to strengthen a lust so unreasonable, and not
prevent the harm arising from excess? and to how many other harms
would not this have given birth?</p>

seize upon this treasure. For to contemn money maketh men
approved, as he said; and provideth that God be glorified; and
warmeth love; and worketh in men loftiness of soul; and
constituteth them priests, yea of a priesthood that bringeth great
reward. For the merciful man is not arrayed in a vest reaching to
the feet, nor does he carry about bells, nor wear a crown; but he
is wrapped in the robe of loving-kindness, a holier than the sacred
vestment; and is anointed with oil, not composed of material
elements, but produced<note place="end" n="880" id="v.xx-p29.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.xx-p30"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xx-p30.1">γεωργουμένῳ</span>.</p></note> by the Spirit, and he beareth a

a plate bearing the Name of God, is himself like to God. For
how? “Ye,” saith He, “shall be like<note place="end" n="881" id="v.xx-p30.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.xx-p31"> This is St. Chrysostom’s usual reading of the
passage. As e.g. in his commentary on the text itself Hom. xviii.

heaven.” (<scripRef passage="Matt. v. 45" id="v.xx-p31.1" parsed="|Matt|5|45|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.45">Matt.

<p class="c19" id="v.xx-p32">Wouldest thou see His altar also? Bezaleel built
it not, nor any other but God Himself; not of stones, but of a
material brighter than the heaven, of reasonable souls. But the
priest entereth into the holy of holies. Into yet more awful
places mayest thou enter when thou offerest this sacrifice, where
none is present but “thy Father, Which seeth in secret,” (<scripRef passage="Matt. vi. 4" id="v.xx-p32.1" parsed="|Matt|6|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.6.4">Matt. vi. 4</scripRef>.) where no other beholdeth.
‘And how,’ saith one, ‘is it possible that none should
behold, when the altar standeth in public view?’ Because this
it is that is admirable, that in those times double doors and veils
made the seclusion: but now, though doing thy sacrifice in public
view, thou mayest do it as in the holy of holies, and in a far more
awful manner. For when thou doest it not for display before men;
though the whole world hath seen, none hath seen, because thou hast
so done it. For He said not simply, “Do” it “not before
men,” but added, “to be seen of them.” (<scripRef passage="Matt. vi. 1" id="v.xx-p32.2" parsed="|Matt|6|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.6.1">Matt. vi. 1</scripRef>.) This altar is composed of
the very members of Christ, and the body of the Lord is made thine
altar. That then revere; on the flesh of the Lord thou
sacrificest the victim. This altar is more awful even than this
which we now use, not only than that used of old. Nay, clamor
not. For this altar is admirable because of the sacrifice that is
laid upon it: but that, the merciful man’s, not only on this
account, but also because it is even composed of the very sacrifice
which maketh the other to be admired. Again, this is but a stone
by nature; but become holy because it receiveth Christ’s Body: 
but that is holy because it is itself Christ’s Body. So that
this beside which thou, the layman, standest, is more awful than
that. Whether then does Aaron seem to thee aught in comparison of
this, or his crown, or his bells, or the holy of holies? For what
need is there henceforth to make our comparison refer to Aaron’s
altar, when even compared with this, it has been shown to be so
glorious? But thou honorest indeed this altar, because it
receiveth Christ’s body; but him that is himself the body of
Christ thou treatest with contumely, and when perishing,
neglectest. This altar mayest thou everywhere see lying, both in
lanes and in market places, and mayest sacrifice upon it every
hour; for on this too is sacrifice performed. And as the priest
stands invoking the Spirit, so dost thou too invoke the Spirit, not
by speech, but by deeds. For nothing doth so sustain and kindle
the fire of the Spirit, as this oil largely poured out. But if
thou wouldest see also what becomes of the things laid upon it,
come hither, and I will show thee them. What then is the smoke,
what the sweet savor of this altar? Praise and thanksgiving.
And how far doth it ascend? as far as unto heaven? By no means,
but it passeth beyond the heaven itself, and the heaven of heaven,
and arriveth even at the throne of the King. For, “Thy
prayers,” saith he, “and thine alms are come up before
God.” (<scripRef passage="Acts x. 4" id="v.xx-p32.3" parsed="|Acts|10|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.10.4">Acts x. 4</scripRef>.) And the sweet savor
which the sense perceives pierceth not far into the air, but this
opened the very vault of heaven. And thou indeed art silent, but
thy work speaketh<note place="end" n="882" id="v.xx-p32.4"><p class="endnote" id="v.xx-p33"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xx-p33.1">βοᾶ</span>.</p></note>: and a
sacrifice of praise is made, no heifer slain nor hide burnt, but a
spiritual soul presenting her proper offering. For such a
sacrifice is more acceptable than any loving-kindness. When then
thou seest a poor believer, think that thou beholdest an altar: 
when thou seest such an one a beggar, not only insult him not, but
even reverence him, and if thou seest another insulting him,
prevent, repel it. For so shalt thou thyself be able both to have
God propitious to thee, and to obtain the promised good things,
whereunto may we all attain, through the grace and love towards men
of our Lord Jesus Christ, by Whom and with Whom, to the Father and
the Holy Ghost, be glory, might, honor, now and forever, and world
without end. Amen.</p>

<p class="c24" id="v.xxi-p4"><span class="c18" id="v.xxi-p4.1">Having</span> completed, in
such sort as behoved his discourse of almsgiving, and having shown
that he loves them more than he is loved, and having recounted the
circumstances of his patience and trials, he now opportunely enters
upon points involving more of reproof, making allusion to the false
apostles, and concluding his discourse with more disagreeable
matter, and with commendations of himself. For he makes this his
business also throughout the Epistle. Which also perceiving, he
hence oftentimes corrects himself, saying in so many words<note place="end" n="883" id="v.xxi-p4.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxi-p5"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxi-p5.1">αὐτὸ τοῦτο</span>.</p></note>; “Do we
begin again to commend ourselves?” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. 3.1" id="v.xxi-p5.2" parsed="|2Cor|3|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.3.1">Ch. iii.
1</scripRef>.) and further on; “We
commend not ourselves again, but give you occasion to glory:”
(<scripRef passage="2 Cor. 5.12" id="v.xxi-p5.3" parsed="|2Cor|5|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.5.12">Ch.
v. 12</scripRef>.) and afterwards;
“I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me.”
(<scripRef passage="2 Cor. 12.11" id="v.xxi-p5.4" parsed="|2Cor|12|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.12.11">Ch. xii. 11</scripRef>.) And many such correctives
doth he use. And one would not be wrong in styling this Epistle
an eulogium of Paul; he makes such large mention both of his grace
and his patience. For since there were some amongst them who
thought great things of themselves, and set themselves above the
Apostle, and accused him as a boaster, and as being nothing, and
teaching no sound doctrine; (now this was in itself the most
certain evidence of their own corruptness;) see how he begins his
rebuke of them; “Now I Paul myself.” Seest thou what
severity, what dignity, is here? For what he would say is this,
‘I beseech you do not compel me, nor leave me to use my power
against those that hold us cheap, and think of us as carnal.’
This is severer than those threats towards them uttered in the
former Epistle; “Shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love and
a spirit of meekness?” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. iv. 21" id="v.xxi-p5.5" parsed="|1Cor|4|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.4.21">1 Cor. iv. 21</scripRef>.) and then again; “Now some
are puffed up as though I were not coming to you; but I will come,
and will know, not the word of them that are puffed up, but the
power.” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. 4.18,19" id="v.xxi-p5.6" parsed="|2Cor|4|18|4|19" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.4.18-2Cor.4.19">ib. 18, 19</scripRef>.) For in this place he
shows both things, both his power, and his philosophy and
forbearance; since he so beseeches them, and with such earnestness,
that he may not be compelled to come to a display of the avenging
power pertaining to him, and to smite and chastise them and exact
the extreme penalty. For he implied this in saying, “But I
beseech you, that I may not when present show courage with the
confidence, wherewith I count to be bold against some which count
of us as if we walked according to the flesh.” For the present,
however, let us speak of the commencement. “Now I Paul
myself.” Great emphasis, great weight<note place="end" n="884" id="v.xxi-p5.7"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxi-p6"> Or, ‘severity.’</p></note> is here. So he says elsewhere,
“Behold I Paul say unto you;” (<scripRef passage="Gal. v. 2" id="v.xxi-p6.1" parsed="|Gal|5|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gal.5.2">Gal. v. 2</scripRef>.) and again, “As Paul the
aged;” (<scripRef passage="Philem. 9" id="v.xxi-p6.2" parsed="|Phlm|1|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Phlm.1.9">Philem. 9</scripRef>.) and again in another place,
“Who hath been a succorer of many, and of me.” (<scripRef passage="Rom. xvi. 2" id="v.xxi-p6.3" parsed="|Rom|16|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.16.2">Rom. xvi. 2</scripRef>.) So also here, “Now
I Paul myself.” This even is a great thing, that himself
beseecheth; but that other is greater which he added, saying, “by
the meekness and gentleness of Christ.” For with the wish of
greatly shaming them, he puts forward that “meekness and
gentleness,” making his entreaty in this way more forcible; as if
he had said, ‘Reverence the gentleness of Christ by which I
beseech you.’ And this he said, at the same time also showing
that although they should lay ever so strong<note place="end" n="885" id="v.xxi-p6.4"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxi-p7"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxi-p7.1">μυρίαν</span>.</p></note> a necessity upon him, he himself is
more inclined to this: it is from being meek, not from want of
power, that he does not proceed against them: for Christ also did
in like manner.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxi-p8">“Who in your presence am lowly among you, but
being absent am of good courage toward you.” What, pray, is
this? Surely he speaks in irony, using their speeches. For they
said this, that ‘when he is present indeed, he is worthy of no
account, but poor and contemptible; but when absent, swells, and
brags, and sets himself up against us, and threatens.’ This at
least he implies also afterwards, saying, “for his letters,”
say they, “are weighty, but his 
<pb n="376" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_376.html" id="v.xxi-Page_376" />bodily presence is weak, and his speech of no
account.” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. 10.10" id="v.xxi-p8.1" parsed="|2Cor|10|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.10.10">v. 10</scripRef>.) He either then speaks in
irony, manifesting great severity and saying, ‘I, the base, I,
the mean, when present, (as they say,) and when absent, lofty:’
or else meaning that even though he should utter great things, it
is not out of pride, but out of his confidence in them.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxi-p9">“But I beseech you, that I may not when present
show courage with the confidence, wherewith I count to be bold
against some which count of us as if we walked according to the
flesh.” Seest thou how great his indignation, and how complete
his refutation of those sayings of theirs? For he saith, ‘I
beseech you, do not compel me to show that even present I am strong
and have power.’ For since they said that ‘when absent, he is
quite bold against us and exalteth himself,’ he uses their very
words, ‘I beseech therefore that they compel me not to use my
power.’ For this is the meaning of, “the confidence.” And
he said not, ‘wherewith I am prepared,’ but ‘wherewith I
count.’ ‘For I have not yet resolved upon this; they however
give me reason enough, but not even so do I wish it.’ And yet
he was doing this not to vindicate himself, but the Gospel. Now
if where it was necessary to vindicate the Message, he is not
harsh, but draws back and delays, and beseeches that there may be
no such necessity; much more would he never have done any thing of
the kind in his own vindication. ‘Grant me then this favor,’
he saith, ‘that ye compel me not to show, that even when present
I am able to be bold against whomsoever it may be necessary; that
is, to chastise and punish them.’ Seest thou how free he was
from ambition, how he did nothing for display, since even where it
was matter of necessity, he hesitates not to call the act,
boldness. “For I beseech you,” he says, “that I may not
when present show courage with the confidence, wherewith I think to
be bold” against some. For this especially is the part of a
teacher, not to be hasty in taking vengeance, but to work a
reformation, and ever to be reluctant and slow in his
punishments. How, pray, does he describe those whom he
threatens? “Those that count of us as though we walked
according to the flesh:” for they accused him as a hypocrite,
as wicked, as a boaster.</p>

‘for,’ says he, ‘we are indeed encompassed with flesh; I own
it, but we do not live by the flesh;’ or rather, he said not even
this, but for the present reserves it, for it belongs to the
encomium on his life: but first discourseth of the Preaching, and
shows that it is not of man, nor needeth aid from beneath.
Wherefore he said not, ‘we do not live according to the flesh,’
but, “we do not war according to the flesh,” that is, ‘we
have undertaken a war and a combat; but we do not war with carnal
weapons, nor by help of any human succors.’</p>

“For our weapons are not of the flesh.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxi-p14">For what sort of weapons are of the flesh? 
Wealth, glory, power, fluency, cleverness, circumventions<note place="end" n="887" id="v.xxi-p14.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxi-p15"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxi-p15.1">περιδρομαὶ</span>.</p></note>, flatteries,
hypocrisies, whatsoever else is similar to these. But ours are
not of this sort: but of what kind are they?</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxi-p16">“Mighty before God.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxi-p17">And he said not, ‘we are not carnal,’ but,
“our weapons.” For as I said, for the present he discourseth
of the Preaching, and refers the whole power to God. And he says
not, ‘spiritual,’ although this was the fitting opposite<note place="end" n="888" id="v.xxi-p17.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxi-p18"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxi-p18.1">τὸ πρὸς

“carnal,” but “mighty,” in this implying the other also,
and showing that their<note place="end" n="889" id="v.xxi-p18.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxi-p19"> The false Apostles.</p></note> weapons are weak and powerless.
And mark the absence of pride in him; for he said not, ‘we are
mighty,’ but, “our weapons are mighty before God.” ‘We
did not make them such, but God Himself.’ For because they were
scourged, were persecuted, and suffered wrongs incurable<note place="end" n="890" id="v.xxi-p19.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxi-p20"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxi-p20.1">ἁ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.xxi-p20.2">νήκεστα</span>.</p></note> without
number, which things were proofs of weakness: to show the
strength of God he says, “but they are mighty before God.”
For this especially shows His strength, that by these things He
gains the victory. So that even though we are encompassed with
them, yet it is He that warreth and worketh by them. Then he goes
through a long eulogium upon them, saying,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxi-p21">“To the casting down of strong holds.”
And lest when hearing of strong holds thou shouldest think of aught
material<note place="end" n="891" id="v.xxi-p21.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxi-p22"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxi-p22.1">αἵσθητὸν</span>.</p></note>, he
says,</p>

“Casting down imaginations.”</p>

by this additional expression declaring the spiritual<note place="end" n="892" id="v.xxi-p24.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxi-p25"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxi-p25.1">νοητὸν</span>.</p></note> character of
the warfare. For these strongholds besiege souls, not bodies.
Whence they are stronger than the others, and therefore also the
weapons they require are mightier. But by strongholds he means
the Grecian pride, and the strength of their sophisms and their
syllogisms. But nevertheless, ‘these weapons,’ he says,
‘confounded every thing that stood up against them; for they cast
down imaginations,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxi-p26">‘And every high thing that is exalted against the
knowledge of God.’ He persisted in the metaphor that he might
make the emphasis greater. ‘For though there should be
strongholds,’ he saith, ‘though fortifications, <pb n="377" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_377.html" id="v.xxi-Page_377" />though any other thing soever, they
yield and give way before these weapons.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxi-p27">“And bringing every thought into captivity to the
obedience of Christ.” And yet the name, “captivity,” hath
an ill sound with it; for it is the destruction of liberty.
Wherefore then has he used it? With a meaning of its own, in
regard to another point. For the word “captivity” conveys two
ideas, the loss of liberty, and the being so violently overpowered
as not to rise up again. It is therefore in respect to this
second meaning that he took it. As when he shall say “I robbed
other churches,” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. xi. 8" id="v.xxi-p27.1" parsed="|2Cor|11|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.11.8">2 Cor.
xi. 8</scripRef>.) he does not
intend the taking stealthily, but the stripping and taking their
all, so also here in saying, “bringing into captivity.” For
the fight was not equally maintained, but he conquered with great
ease. Wherefore he did not say, ‘we conquer and have the
better,’ only; but ‘we even bring “into captivity;”’ just
as above, he did not say, ‘we advance engines against the
“strongholds:”’ but, ‘we cast them down, for great is the
superiority of our weapons.’ ‘For we war not with words,’
he saith, but with deeds against words, not with fleshly wisdom,
but with the spirit of meekness and of power. How was it likely
then I should hunt after honor, and boast in words, and threaten by
letters;’ (as they accused him, saying, “his letters are
weighty,”) ‘when our might lay not in these things?’ But
having said, “bringing every thought into captivity to the
obedience of Christ,” because the name of “captivity” was
unpleasant, he presently afterwards put an end to the metaphor,
saying, “unto the obedience of Christ:” from slavery unto
liberty, from death unto life, from destruction to salvation. For
we came not merely to strike down, but to bring over to the truth
those who are opposed to us.</p>

‘And yet if thou hadst done it now,’ saith one, ‘thou
wouldest have wrought greater gain.’ ‘By no means, for if I
had done it now, I should have involved you also in the
punishment. Howbeit it behoved to punish them, indeed, but to
spare you. Yet if I spared, I should have seemed to do it out of
favor: now this I do not desire, but first to amend you, and then
to proceed against them.’ What can be tenderer than the heart
of the Apostle? who because he saw his own mixed up with aliens,
desires indeed to inflict the blow, but forbears, and restrains his
indignation until these shall have withdrawn, that he may smite
these alone; yea rather, not these even. For he therefore
threatens this, and says he is desirous to separate unto punishment
them alone, that they also being amended by the fear may change,
and he let loose his anger against no one. For just like a most
excellent physician, and common father, and patron, and guardian<note place="end" n="896" id="v.xxi-p32.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxi-p33"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxi-p33.1">κηδεμὼν</span>.</p></note>, so did he
all things, so cared he for all, removing impediments, checking the
pestilent, running about every whither. For not by fighting did
he so achieve the work, but advancing as if to a ready and an easy
victory, he planted his trophies, undermining, casting down,
overthrowing the strongholds of the devil, and the engines of the
demons; and carried over their whole booty to the camp of Christ.
Nor did he even take breath a little, bounding off from these to
those, and from those again to others, like some very able general,
raising trophies every day, or rather every hour. For having
entered into the battle with nothing but a little tunic<note place="end" n="897" id="v.xxi-p33.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxi-p34"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxi-p34.1">χιτωνίσκου</span>.</p></note>, the tongue
of Paul took the cities of his enemies with their men and bows and
spears and darts and all.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxi-p35">For he spake only; and, falling upon his enemies
more fiercely than any fire, his words drave out the demons and
brought over unto him the men that were possessed of them. For
when he cast out that demon, the evil one, fifty thousand sorcerers
coming together burnt their books of magic and revolted to the
truth. (See <scripRef passage="Acts xix. 19" id="v.xxi-p35.1" parsed="|Acts|19|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.19.19">Acts xix.
19</scripRef>.) And like as
in a war, when a tower has fallen or a tyrant been brought low, all
his partizans cast away their arms and run unto the [opposing]
general; so truly did it happen then also. For when the demon was
cast out, they all having been besieged, and having cast away, yea
rather having destroyed, their books, ran unto the feet of Paul.
But he setting himself<note place="end" n="898" id="v.xxi-p35.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxi-p36"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxi-p36.1">παραταττομενος</span>.</p></note> against the world as though against

raised a dead man, now blinded a third, (I mean the sorcerer,) nor
even when shut up in a prison indulged in rest, but even there
brought over to himself the jailor, effecting the goodly captivity
we treat of.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxi-p38"><pb n="378" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_378.html" id="v.xxi-Page_378" />[4.] Let
us also imitate him after our power. And why do I say, after our
power? For he that wills may come even near unto him, and behold
his valor, and imitate his heroism. For still he is doing this
work, “casting down imaginations, and every high thing that is
exalted against the knowledge of God.” And although many
heretics have attempted to cut him in pieces; yet still, even
though dismembered, he displayeth a mighty strength. For both
Marcion and Manichæus use him indeed, but after cutting him in
pieces; but still even so they are refuted by the several
members. For even a hand only of this champion being found among
them puts them utterly to the rout; and a foot only, left amongst
others, pursues and prostrates them, in order that thou mayest
learn the superabundance of his power, and that, although shorn of
his limbs even, he is able to destroy all his adversaries.
‘This however,’ saith one, ‘is an instance of perversion,
that those who are battling with each other should all use
him.’ An instance of perversion certainly, but not in Paul,
(God forbid,) but in them who use him. For he was not
parti-colored<note place="end" n="900" id="v.xxi-p38.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxi-p39"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxi-p39.1">ποικἰλος τις</span>.</p></note>, but uniform
and clear, but they perverted his words to their own notions.
‘And wherefore,’ saith one, ‘were they so spoken as to give
handles to those that wished for them?’ He did not give
handles, but their frenzy used his words not rightly; since this
whole world also is both wonderful and great, and a sure proof of
the wisdom of God, and “the heavens declare the glory of God, and
day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night declareth
knowledge;” (<scripRef passage="Ps. xix. 1, 2" id="v.xxi-p39.2" parsed="|Ps|19|1|19|2" osisRef="Bible:Ps.19.1-Ps.19.2">Ps.
xix. 1, 2</scripRef>.) but
nevertheless, many have stumbled at it and in contrary directions
to one another. And some have admired it so much above its worth
as to think it God; whilst others have been so insensible of its
beauty as to assert it to be unworthy of God’s creating hand<note place="end" n="901" id="v.xxi-p39.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxi-p40"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxi-p40.1">δημίουργίας</span>.</p></note>, and to
ascribe the greater share in it to a certain evil matter. And yet
God provided for both points by making it beautiful and great that
it might not be deemed alien from his wisdom; yet defective and not
sufficient unto itself that it might not be suspected to be God.
But nevertheless those who were blinded by their own reasonings
fell away into contradictory notions, refuting one another, and
becoming each the other’s accuser, and vindicating the wisdom of
God even by the very reasonings which led them astray. And why do
I speak of the sun and the heaven? The Jews saw so many marvels
happen before their eyes, yet straightway worshipped a calf.
Again they saw Christ casting out demons, yet called him one that
had a demon. But this was no imputation against him that cast
them out, but an accusation of their understanding who were so
blinded. Condemn not then Paul on account of their judgment who
have used him amiss; but understand well the treasures in him, and
develop his riches, so shalt thou make noble stand against all,
fenced by his armor. So shalt thou be able to stop the mouths
both of Greeks and Jews. ‘And how,’ saith one, ‘seeing they
believe him not?’ By the things wrought through him, by the
reformation effected in the world. For it was not of human
power<note place="end" n="902" id="v.xxi-p40.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxi-p41"> [Some remarks of Hodge <i>in loco</i> are
worth quoting here as confirming Chrysostom’s view of the passage
and showing its permanent application. “The conflict to which
the Apostle refers is that between truth and error. When the
Gospel was first proclaimed it found itself in conflict with all
the forms of religion and philosophy then prevailing among men.
To the wise of this world the Gospel appeared as foolishness. It
was, however, the wisdom and power of God. The conflict then
begun has continued ever since, and is now as deadly as at any
former period. Men of science and philosophers are as confident
in their conclusions, and as much disposed to exalt themselves, or
their opinions, against the knowledge of God as ever. There is no
doubt as to the issue of this contest. It is a contest between
God and man, in which, of course, God must prevail. The
instructive lesson which the Apostle designs here to inculcate is
that this warfare must not be conducted on the part of the
advocates of the Gospel with carnal weapons. They must not rely
upon their own resources and attempt to overcome their enemies by
argument. They must not become philosophers and turn the Gospel
into a philosophy. This would be to make it a human conflict on
both sides. It would be human reason against human reason, the
intellect of one man against the intellect of another man. Paul
told the Corinthians in his former Epistle that he did not appear
among them as a philosopher, but as a witness; he came not with the
words of man’s wisdom: he did not rely for success on his
powers of argument or of persuasion, but on the demonstration of
the Spirit. The faith which he labored to secure was not to be
founded on the wisdom of men, but on the power of God; not on
arguments addressed to the understanding but on the testimony of
God. That testimony has the same effect which intuition has. It
reveals the truth to the mind and conscience as self-evident: and
therefore it cannot be resisted. A rationalistic Christian, a
philosophizing theologian, therefore, lays aside the divine for the
human, the wisdom of God for the wisdom of man, the infinite and
infallible for the finite and the fallible.” The whole history
of the Church shows that whenever high imaginations were cast down
and strongholds overthrown, it was by the simple testimony of the
word of God, presented not as something to be proved but as
something to be believed. C.]</p></note> that so

<p class="c27" id="v.xxii-p3">Ye look at the things that are before your face.
If any man trusteth in himself that he is Christ’s, let him
consider this again with himself that even as he is Christ’s, so
also are we.</p>

<p class="c24" id="v.xxii-p4"><span class="c18" id="v.xxii-p4.1">What</span> one may
especially admire in Paul amongst other things is this, that when
he has fallen upon an urgent necessity for exalting himself, he
manages both to accomplish this point, and also not to appear
offensive to the many on account of this egotism; a thing we may
see particularly in his Epistle to the Galatians. For having
there fallen upon such an argument, he provides for both these
points; a matter of the very utmost difficulty and demanding much
prudence; he is at once modest and says somewhat great of
himself. And observe how in this place also he makes it of great
account, “Ye look at the things that are before your face.”
Behold here also prudence. For having rebuked those that deceived
them, he confined not his remarks to them, but he leaps away from
them to these too; and he does so constantly. For, in truth, he
scourgeth not those only that lead astray<note place="end" n="904" id="v.xxii-p4.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxii-p5"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxii-p5.1">παρακρουομένων</span>.</p></note>, but the deceived also. For had
he let even them go without calling them to an account<note place="end" n="905" id="v.xxii-p5.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxii-p6"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxii-p6.1">ἀ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.xxii-p6.2">νευθύνους</span>.</p></note>, they would
not so easily have been reformed by what was said to the others;
but would have been greatly elated even, as not being amenable to
accusations. Therefore he scourgeth them also. And this is not
all that is to be admired in him, but this farther, that he rebukes
either party in a manner suitable to each. Hear at least what he
says to these, “Ye look at the things that are before your
face.” The accusation is no light one; but a mark of men
exceedingly easy to be deceived. Now what he says is this, ‘ye
test by what appear, by things carnal, by things bodily.’ What
is meant by ‘what appear?’ If one is rich, if one is puffed
up, if one is surrounded by many flatterers, if one says great
things of himself, if one is vain-glorious, if one makes a pretence
of virtue without having virtue, for this is the meaning of, “ye
look at the things that are before your face.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxii-p7">“If any man trust in himself that he is
Christ’s, let him consider this again with himself, that even as
he is Christ’s, even so also are we.” For he does not wish to
be vehement at the beginning, but he increases and draws to a
head<note place="end" n="906" id="v.xxii-p7.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxii-p8"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxii-p8.1">κορυφοῦται</span>.</p></note> by little
and little. But observe here how much harshness and covert
meaning there is. He shows this by using the words “with
himself.” For he saith, ‘Let him not wait to learn this from
us; that is, by our rebuke of himself,’ but “let him consider
this with himself, that even as he is Christ’s, so also are
we;” not that he was Christ’s in such manner as the other was,
but, “that even as he is Christ’s, so also am I
Christ’s.” Thus far the community holds good: for it is not
surely the case that he indeed is Christ’s, but I some
other’s. Then having laid down this equality between them, he
goes on to add wherein he exceeded, saying,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxii-p9"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 10.8" id="v.xxii-p9.1" parsed="|2Cor|10|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.10.8">Ver. 8</scripRef>.
“For though I should glory somewhat abundantly concerning our
authority which the Lord gave for building you up, and not for
casting you down, I shall not be put to shame.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxii-p10">For since he was going to say somewhat great,
observe how he softens it. For nothing doth so offend the
majority of hearers as for any one to praise himself. Wherefore
to cut at the root of this offensiveness, he says, “For though I
should glory somewhat abundantly.” And he did not say, ‘if
any man trust that he is Christ’s let him think that he is far
short of us. For I possess much authority from Him, so as to
punish and to kill whomsoever I choose;’ but what? “For
though I should glory even somewhat abundantly.” And yet he
possessed more than can be told, but nevertheless he lowers it in
his way of speaking. And he said not, ‘I glory,’ but, “if I
should glory,” if I should choose to do so: at once both
showing modesty, and declaring his superiority. If therefore he
says, “I should glory concerning the authority which the Lord
gave me.” Again, he ascribes the whole to Him, and makes the
gift common. “For building up, and not for casting down.”
Seest thou how again he allays the envy his praises might give rise
to, and draws the hearer over to himself by mentioning <pb n="380" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_380.html" id="v.xxii-Page_380" />the use for which he received
it? Then why doth he say, “Casting down imaginations?”
Because this is itself an especial form of building up, the
removing of hindrances, and detecting the unsound, and laying the
true together in the building. For this end therefore we received
it, that we might build up. But if any should spar and battle
with us, and be incurable, we will use that other power also,
destroying<note place="end" n="907" id="v.xxii-p10.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxii-p11"> Or, casting down.</p></note> and
overthrowing him. Wherefore also he says, “I shall not be put
to shame,” that is, I shall not be proved a liar or a
boaster.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxii-p12">[2.] <scripRef passage="2 Cor. 10.9-11" id="v.xxii-p12.1" parsed="|2Cor|10|9|10|11" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.10.9-2Cor.10.11">Ver. 9, 10, 11</scripRef>. “But that I may not seem
as if I would terrify you: for his letters, say they, are weighty
and strong: but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech of no
account. Let such a one reckon this, that what we are in word by
letters when we are absent, such are we also in deed when we are
present.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxii-p13">What he says is this: ‘I could boast indeed, but
that they may not say the same things again, to wit, that I boast
in my letters, and am contemptible when present, I will say nothing
great.’ And yet afterwards he did say something great, but not
about this power by which he was formidable, but about revelations
and at greater lengths about trials. ‘Therefore, that I may not
seem to be terrifying you, “let such an one reckon this, that
what we are by letters when we are absent, such are we also in deed
when we are present.’” For since they said, ‘he writes
great things of himself, but when he is present he is worthy of no
consideration,’ therefore he says these things, and those again
in a moderated form. For he did not say, ‘as we write great
things, so when we are present we also do great things,’ but in
more subdued phrase. For when he addressed himself to the others
indeed, he stated it with vehemency, saying, “I beseech you that
I may not when present show courage with the confidence wherewith I
think to be bold against some:” but when to these, he is more
subdued. And therefore he says, ‘what we are when present, such
too when absent, that is, lowly, modest, no where boasting. And
it is plain from what follows,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxii-p14"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 10.12" id="v.xxii-p14.1" parsed="|2Cor|10|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.10.12">Ver. 12</scripRef>. “For we are not
bold to number, or compare in ourselves<note place="end" n="908" id="v.xxii-p14.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxii-p15"> R.T. compare ourselves, [which is correct, as
there is no <span class="c18" id="v.xxii-p15.1">ms</span>. authority for the
preposition inserted by Chrysostom. C.]</p></note> with some that commend
themselves.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxii-p16">Here he both shows that those false Apostles are
boasters and say great things of themselves: and ridicules them
as commending themselves. ‘But we do no such thing: but even
if we shall do any thing great, we refer all unto God, and compare
ourselves with one another.’ Wherefore also he added,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxii-p17">“But they themselves measuring themselves by
themselves and comparing themselves among themselves are without
understanding.” Now what he says is this: ‘we do not
compare ourselves with them, but with one another.’ For further
on he says, “in nothing am I behind the very chiefest
Apostles;” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. 12.11" id="v.xxii-p17.1" parsed="|2Cor|12|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.12.11">Chap. xii. 11</scripRef>.) and in the former Epistle,
“I labored more abundantly than they all;” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. xv. 10" id="v.xxii-p17.2" parsed="|1Cor|15|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.15.10">1 Cor. xv. 10</scripRef>.) and again, “Truly the
signs of an Apostle were wrought among you in all patience.”
(<scripRef passage="2 Cor. 12.12" id="v.xxii-p17.3" parsed="|2Cor|12|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.12.12">Chap. xii. 12</scripRef>.) ‘So that we compare
ourselves with ourselves, not with those that have nothing: for
such arrogance cometh of folly.’ Either then he says this with
reference to himself, or with reference to them, that ‘we dare
not compare ourselves with those who contend with one another and
boast great things and do not understand:’ that is, do not
perceive how ridiculous they are in being thus arrogant, and in
exalting themselves amongst one another.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxii-p18"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 10.13" id="v.xxii-p18.1" parsed="|2Cor|10|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.10.13">Ver. 13</scripRef>. “But we will not glory
beyond our measure:” as they do.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxii-p19">For it is probable that in their boasting they said,
‘we have converted the world, we have reached unto the ends of
the earth,’ and vented many other such like big words. ‘But
not so we,’ he says,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxii-p20">“But according to the measure of the province
which God apportioned to us as a measure, to reach even unto
you.” So that his humility is evident on either hand, both in
that he boasted nothing more than he had wrought, and that he
refers even this itself to God. For, “according to the measure
of the province,” saith he, “which God apportioned to us, a
measure to reach even unto you.” Just as if portioning out a
vine to husbandmen, even so He meted out unto us. As far then as
we have been counted worthy to attain to, so far we boast.</p>

ourselves overmuch, as though we reached not unto you: for we
came even as far as unto you in preaching the Gospel of
Christ.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxii-p22">Not simply ‘we came,’ but, ‘we announced, we
preached, we persuaded, we succeeded.’ For it is probable that
they having merely come to the disciples of the Apostles, ascribed
the whole to themselves, from their bare presence among them.
‘But not so we: nor can any one say that we were not able to
come as far as to you, and that we stretched our boasting as far as
to you in words only; for we also preached the word to you.’</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxii-p23">[3.] <scripRef passage="2 Cor. 10.15,16" id="v.xxii-p23.1" parsed="|2Cor|10|15|10|16" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.10.15-2Cor.10.16">Ver. 15, 16</scripRef>. “Not glorying beyond”
our “measure,” that is, “in other men’s labors, but having

beyond you, and not to glory in another’s province in regard of
things ready to our hand.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxii-p24">He sets forth a large accusation of them on these
grounds, both that they boasted of things without their measure,
and of other men’s labors; and that whilst the whole of the toil
was the Apostles’, they plumed themselves upon their labors.
‘But we,’ says he, ‘showed these things in our deeds. We
will not imitate those men therefore, but will say such things
where our deeds bear us witness. And why,’ saith he, ‘do I
say, you?’ “for I have hope that as your faith groweth;” for
he doth not assert absolutely, preserving his own character, but,
‘I hope,’ he says, ‘if you make progress, that our province
will be extended even farther, “to preach the Gospel in the
regions beyond.” For we shall advance farther yet,’ he says,
‘so as to preach and labor, not so as to boast in words of what
other men have labored.’ And well did he call it “province
and measure,” as though he had come into possession of the world,
and a rich inheritance; and showing that the whole was wholly
God’s. ‘Having then such works,’ he says, ‘and expecting
greater, we do not boast as they do who have nothing, nor do we
ascribe any part to ourselves, but the whole to God. Wherefore
also he adds,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxii-p25"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 10.17" id="v.xxii-p25.1" parsed="|2Cor|10|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.10.17">Ver. 17</scripRef>. “He that glorieth, let

commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord
commendeth.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxii-p27">He did not say, we are so, “but whom the Lord
commendeth.” Seest thou how modestly he speaks? But if as he
proceeds he stirreth up loftier words, wonder not, for this also
cometh of Paul’s prudence. For if he had gone on in every part
to speak lowly words, he would not have hit these men so
effectually, nor have extricated the disciples from their error.
For it is possible both by modesty ill-timed to do harm, and by
saying something admirable of one’s self at a proper time to do
good. As therefore he also did. For there was no little danger
in the disciples being persuaded into any mean opinion of Paul.
Not that Paul sought the glory that cometh of men. For had he
sought this, he would not have kept silence so long on those great
and marvellous matters of “fourteen years ago;” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. 12.20" id="v.xxii-p27.1" parsed="|2Cor|12|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.12.20">Chap.
xii. 20</scripRef>.) nor would
he, when necessity was laid upon him, have so shrunk back and
hesitated to speak of them; very evidently he would not even then
have spoken, had he not been compelled. Certainly then it was not
from a desire after the glory which cometh from men that he said
these things, but out of tender care for the disciples. For since
they cast reproaches<note place="end" n="909" id="v.xxii-p27.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxii-p28"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxii-p28.1">ἔ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.xxii-p28.2">βαλλον</span>.</p></note> at him as a braggart, and as
boastful in words but able to show nothing in deeds, he is
compelled subsequently to come to those revelations. Although he
had it in his power to convince them by his deeds, at the time when
he said these things: yet he still persists, nevertheless, in
using menaces in words. For he was most especially free from
vain-glory; and this his whole life proves, both before and after
this. For instance, it was because of this that he changed all at
once; and having changed, confounded the Jews and cast away all
that honor he had from them, although he was himself their head and
their champion. But he considered none of those things when he
had found the truth; but took instead their insults and contumely;
for he looked to the salvation of the many, thinking this
everything. For he that thinketh nothing of hell nor of heaven
nor of ten thousand worlds in regard of his longing after Christ,
how should he hunt after the glory which cometh from the many? By
no means; but he is even very lowly when he may be so, and brands<note place="end" n="910" id="v.xxii-p28.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxii-p29"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxii-p29.1">στηλιτεύει</span>.</p></note> his former
life with infamy when he calls himself, “a blasphemer, and a
persecutor, and injurious.” (<scripRef passage="1 Tim. i. 13" id="v.xxii-p29.2" parsed="|1Tim|1|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.1.13">1 Tim. i. 13</scripRef>.) And his disciple
Luke too says many things of him, evidently having learnt them from
himself, himself displaying fully<note place="end" n="911" id="v.xxii-p29.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxii-p30"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxii-p30.1">ἐ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.xxii-p30.2">μπομπευοντος</span>.</p></note> his former life no less than that
after his conversion.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxii-p31">[4.] Now I say these things, not that we may
hear merely, but that we may learn also. For if he remembered
those transgressions before the Laver, although they were all
effaced, what forgiveness can we have who are unmindful of those
after the Laver ourselves? What sayest thou, O man? Thou hast
offended God, and dost thou forget? This is a second offence, a
second enmity. Of what sins then dost thou ask forgiveness? Of
those which thou even knowest not thyself? Surely, (for is it not
so?) thou art deeply anxious and thoughtful how thou mayest give
account of them, thou who dost not so much as care to remember
them, but sportest with what is no sporting matter. But there
will come a time when our sport can go on no longer. For we must
needs die: (for the great insensibility of the many obliges me to
speak even of things that are evident:)  and must needs rise
again, and be judged, and be punished; nay rather this needs not,
if we choose. For those other things are not at our own disposal;
neither our end, nor our resurrection, nor our judgment, but at our
Lord’s; but our suffering punishment or not is at our own
disposal; for this is of those things that may or may not happen<note place="end" n="912" id="v.xxii-p31.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxii-p32"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxii-p32.1">τῶν ἐνδεχομένων</span>.</p></note>. But if we
choose, <pb n="382" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_382.html" id="v.xxii-Page_382" />we shall
make it of the number of impossible things; just as Paul, as Peter,
as all the saints did; for it is even impossible for them to be
punished. If therefore we have a mind, it is in like manner
impossible also that we should suffer ought. For even if we have
offended in ten thousand things, it is possible to recover
ourselves so long as we are here. Let us then recover
ourselves: and let the old man consider that in a little while
hence he will depart, since he took his pleasure long enough in his
lifetime; (although what sort of pleasure is this, to live in
wickedness? but for the present I so speak in respect to his way of
thinking;) let him consider, besides, that it is possible for him
in a short time to wash away all. The young man again, let him
also consider the uncertainty of death, and that oftentimes, when
many older persons continued here, the young were carried off
before them. For, for this reason, that we may not make traffic<note place="end" n="913" id="v.xxii-p32.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxii-p33"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxii-p33.1">πραγματευώμεθα</span>.</p></note> of our
death, it is left in uncertainty. Wherefore also a certain wise
man adviseth, saying, “Make no tarrying to turn unto the Lord,
and put not off from day to day: for thou knowest not what
to-morrow shall bring forth.” (<scripRef passage="Ecclesiasticus 5.7; Prov. 27.1" id="v.xxii-p33.2" parsed="|Sir|5|7|0|0;|Prov|27|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Sir.5.7 Bible:Prov.27.1">Ecclus. v. 7; Prov. xxvii. 1</scripRef>.) For by putting off
there is danger and fear; but by not putting off manifest and
secure salvation. Hold fast then by virtue. For so, even if
thou have departed young, thou hast departed in safety; and if thou
shouldst come to old age, thou shalt arrive [at death] with great
provision made, and shalt have a double feast all thy life long;
both in that thou abstainest from vice, and layest hold on
virtue. Say not, ‘there will come a time when it may be well to
turn,’ for this language provokes God exceedingly. And why
so? Because He hath promised thee countless ages, but thou art
not even willing to labor during this present life, this short life
that dureth but a season; but art so indolent and unmanly as to
seek a shorter even than this. Are there not the same revellings
daily? Are there not the same tables, the same harlots, the same
theatres, the same wealth? How long wilt thou love those things
as though they were aught? How long will thy appetite for evil
remain insatiate? Consider that as often as thou hast fornicated,
so often hast thou condemned thyself. For such is the nature of
sin: once committed, the Judge hath also passed his sentence.
Hast thou been drunken, been gluttonous, or robbed? Hold now,
turn right back, acknowledge it to God as a mercy that He snatched
thee not away in the midst of thy sins; seek not yet another set
time<note place="end" n="914" id="v.xxii-p33.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxii-p34"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxii-p34.1">προθεσμίαν</span>.</p></note> wherein to
work evil. Many have been snatched away in the midst of their
covetousness, and have departed to manifest punishment. Fear lest
thou also shouldest suffer this, and without excuse. ‘But God
gave to many a set time for confession in extreme old age.’
What then? Will He give it to thee also? ‘Perhaps He will,’
says one. Why sayest thou ‘perhaps,’ and ‘sometimes,’ and
‘often?’ Consider that thou art deliberating about thy soul,
and put also the contrary case, and calculate, and say, ‘But what
if He should not give it?’ ‘But what if He should give it?’
saith he. God hath indeed given it; but still this supposition is
safer and more profitable than that. For if thou begin now, thou
hast gained all, whether thou hast a set time granted thee or not;
but if thou art always putting off, for this very cause perhaps
thou shalt not have one given thee. When thou goest out to
battle, thou dost not say, ‘there is no need to make my will,
perhaps I shall come back safe;’ nor dost thou when deliberating
about marriage, say ‘suppose I take a poor wife, many have even
in this way got rich contrary to expectation;’ nor when building
a house, ‘suppose I lay a rotten foundation, many houses have
stood even so;’ yet in deliberating about the soul, thou leanest
on things more rotten still; urging thy ‘perhaps,’ and
‘often,’ and ‘sometimes,’ and trustest thyself to these
uncertainties. ‘Nay,’ saith one, ‘not to an uncertainty,
but to the mercy of God, for God is merciful.’ I know it too;
but still this merciful God snatched those away of whom I spoke.
And what if after thou hast had time given thee, thou shalt still
continue as thou wert? for this sort of man will be listless even
in old age. ‘Nay,’ he said, ‘not so.’ For this mode of
reasoning even after the eighty years desireth ninety, and after
the ninety an hundred, and after the hundred will be yet more
indisposed to act. And so the whole of life will have been
consumed in vain, and what was spoken of the Jews will happen also
to thee; “Their days were consumed in vanity.” (<scripRef passage="Ps. lxxviii. 33" id="v.xxii-p34.2" parsed="|Ps|78|33|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.78.33">Ps. lxxviii. 33</scripRef>.) And would that in vanity
only, and not unto evil also. For when we have departed thither
bearing the heavy burden of our sins, this will be unto evil
also. For we shall carry away fuel for the fire and a plentiful
feast for the worm. Wherefore I pray and conjure you to halt at
length in noble wise, and to desist from wickedness, that we may
also obtain the promised good things: whereunto may we all
attain, through the grace and love towards men of our Lord Jesus
Christ, with Whom to the Father, together with the Holy Spirit, be
glory, might, honor, now and ever, and world without end.
Amen.</p>

<p class="c24" id="v.xxiii-p5"><span class="c18" id="v.xxiii-p5.1">Being</span> about to enter
upon his own praises he uses much previous correction. And he
does this not once or twice, although the necessity of the subject,
and what he had often said, were sufficient excuse for him. For
he that remembereth sins which God remembered not, and who
therefore saith that he was unworthy of the very name of the
Apostles, even by the most insensate is seen clearly not to be
saying what he is now going to say, for the sake of glory. For if
one must say something startling, even this would be especially
injurious to his glory, his speaking something about himself; and
to the more part it is offensive. But nevertheless he regarded
not timidly any of these things, but he looked to one thing, the
salvation of his hearers. But still in order that he might not
cause harm to the unthinking by this, by saying, I mean, great
things of himself, he employs out of abundant caution these many
preparatory correctives, and says, “Would that ye could bear with
me,” whilst I play the fool in some little things, yea, rather,
“ye do indeed bear with me.” Beholdest thou wisdom? For
when he says, “would that,” it is as putting it at their
disposal: but when he even asserts [that they do], it is as
confiding greatly in their affection, and as declaring that he both
loves and is loved. Yea, rather, not from bare love merely, but
from a sort of warm and insane passion he says that they ought to
bear with him even when he plays the fool. And therefore he
added, “For I am jealous over you with a godly jealousy<note place="end" n="916" id="v.xxiii-p5.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxiii-p6"> Gr. <i>jealousy of God</i>.</p></note>.” He did
not say, ‘for I love you,’ but uses a term far more vehement
than this. For those souls are jealous which burn ardently for
those they love, and jealousy can in no other way be begotten than
out of a vehement affection. Then that they may not think, that
it is for the sake of power, or honor, or wealth, or any other such
like thing, that he desires their affection, he added, “with a
jealousy of God.” For God also is said to be jealous, not that
any should suppose<note place="end" n="917" id="v.xxiii-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxiii-p7"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxiii-p7.1">ὑ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.xxiii-p7.2">ποπτεύση</span>.</p></note> passion, (for the Godhead is
impassible,) but that all may know that He doeth all things from no
other regard than their sakes over whom He is jealous; not that
Himself may gain aught, but that He may save them. Among men
indeed jealousy ariseth not from this cause, but for the sake of
their own repose; not because the beloved ones sustain outrage, but
lest these who love them should be wounded, and be outshone in the
good graces, and stand lower in the affections, of the beloved.
But here it is not so. ‘For I care not,’ he says, ‘for
this, lest I should stand lower in your esteem; but lest I should
see you corrupted. For such is God’s jealousy; and such is mine
also, intense at once and pure.’ Then there is also this
necessary reason;</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxiii-p8">“For I espoused you to one husband, as a pure
virgin.” ‘Therefore I am jealous, not for myself, but for him
to whom I have espoused you.’ For the present time is the time
of espousal, but the time of the nuptials is another; when they
sing, ‘the Bridegroom hath risen up.’ Oh what things unheard
of!  In the world they are virgins before the marriage, but after
the marriage no longer. But here it is not so: but even though
they be not virgins before this marriage, after the marriage they
become virgins. So the whole Church is a virgin. For addressing
himself even to all, both husbands and wives, he speaks thus. But
let us see what he brought and espoused us with, what kind of
nuptial gifts. Not gold, not silver, but the kingdom of heaven.
Wherefore also he said, “We are ambassadors on behalf of
Christ,” and beseeches them, when he was about to receive the
Bride. What happened in Abraham’s case was a type of this.
(<scripRef passage="Gen. xxiv. 4" id="v.xxiii-p8.1" parsed="|Gen|24|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.24.4">Gen. xxiv. 4</scripRef>, &amp;c.)  For he sent his
faithful servant to seek a Gentile maiden in marriage; and in this
case God sent His own servants to seek the Church in marriage for
His son, and prophets from of old saying, “Hearken, O daughter,
and consider, and forget thine own people and thy father’s house,
and the King <pb n="384" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_384.html" id="v.xxiii-Page_384" />shall desire thy
beauty.” (<scripRef passage="Ps. xlv. 10, 11" id="v.xxiii-p8.2" parsed="|Ps|45|10|45|11" osisRef="Bible:Ps.45.10-Ps.45.11">Ps. xlv. 10,
11</scripRef>.) Seest thou the
prophet also espousing? seest thou the Apostle too expressing the
same thing himself with much boldness, and saying, “I espoused
you to one husband that I might present you as a pure virgin to
Christ?” Seest thou wisdom again? For having said, ‘Ye
ought to bear with me,’ he did not say, ‘for I am your teacher
and I speak not for mine own sake:’ but he uses this expression
which invested them with especial dignity, placing himself in the
room of her who promotes a match, and them in the rank of the
bride; and he adds these words;</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxiii-p9"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 11.3" id="v.xxiii-p9.1" parsed="|2Cor|11|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.11.3">Ver. 3</scripRef>. “But I fear lest by
any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety, so
your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is toward
Christ<note place="end" n="918" id="v.xxiii-p9.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxiii-p10"> Such seems to be St. Chrysostom’s rendering.
See below. [It is not easy to understand this note of the English
translator. Chrysostom has the accepted text <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxiii-p10.1"> εἰς τὸν χριστόν</span>, which the Vulgate, Beza and Calvin make
equivalent to <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxiii-p10.2">ἐν
χριστῷ</span>. But the proper sense is, as Thayer <i>sub
voce</i> gives it, “sincerity of mind toward Christ, i.e.,
single-hearted faith in Christ, as opposed to false wisdom in
matters pertaining to Christianity.” The allusion to the
marriage relation in the previous verse is still kept up. The
Apostle’s fear was that the Corinthians might be so corrupted as
to turn away from the undivided affection and devotion which they
owed to the Lord Jesus Christ as much as a bride to her husband.
His warning is confirmed by his reference to the one standing
example of the inconstancy of the human heart, and of the fearful
consequences of forsaking God. In his mind the narrative of the
fall was neither a fable nor an allegory, but an historical fact.
C.]</p></note>.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxiii-p11">‘For although the destruction be yours [alone],
yet is the sorrow mine as well.’ And consider his wisdom. For
he does not assert, although they were corrupted; and so he showed
when he said, “When your obedience is fulfilled,” (c. <scripRef passage="2 Cor. 10.6" id="v.xxiii-p11.1" parsed="|2Cor|10|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.10.6">x. 6</scripRef>.) and “I shall bewail many
which have sinned already;” (c. <scripRef passage="2 Cor. 12.21" id="v.xxiii-p11.2" parsed="|2Cor|12|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.12.21">xii. 21</scripRef>.) but still he does not
leave them to get shameless. And therefore he says, “lest at
any time.” For this neither condemns nor is silent; for neither
course were safe, whether to speak out plainly or to conceal
perpetually. Therefore he employs this middle form, saying,
“lest at any time.” For this is the language neither of one
that entirely distrusts, nor entirely relies on them, but of one
who stands between these two. In this way then he palliated, but
by his mention of that history threw them into an indescribable
terror, and cuts them off from all forgiveness. For even although
the serpent was malignant, and she senseless, yet did none of these
things snatch the woman from punishment. ‘Beware then,’ he
says, ‘lest such be your fate, and there be naught to screen
you. For he too promising greater things, so deceived.’
Whence it is plain that these<note place="end" n="919" id="v.xxiii-p11.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxiii-p12"> i.e. False Apostles.</p></note> too, by boasting and puffing
themselves up, deceived. And this may be conjectured not from
this place only, but also from what he says afterwards,</p>

“If he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we did not
preach, or if ye receive a different Spirit which ye did not
receive, or a different Gospel which ye did not accept, ye do well
to bear with him.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxiii-p14">And he does not say, ‘Lest by any means as
Adam was deceived:’ but shows that those men<note place="end" n="920" id="v.xxiii-p14.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxiii-p15"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxiii-p15.1">γυναῖκας ὅντας
τοὺς</span>.</p></note> are but women who are thus abused,
for it is the part of woman to be deceived. And he did not say,
‘so ye also should be deceived:’ but keeping up the metaphor,
he says, “so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity
that is toward Christ.” ‘From the simplicity, I say, not from
wickedness; neither out of wickedness [is it], nor out of your not
believing, but out of simplicity.’ But, nevertheless, not even
under such circumstances are the deceived entitled to forgiveness,
as Eve showed. But if this does not entitle to forgiveness, much
more will it not do so, when through vain-glory any is so<note place="end" n="921" id="v.xxiii-p15.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxiii-p16"> i.e. Is deceived.</p></note>.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxiii-p17">[2.] “For if he that cometh preacheth another
Jesus whom we did not preach:” showing hereby that their
deceivers were not Corinthians, but persons from some other quarter
previously corrupted: wherefore he saith, “he that
cometh.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxiii-p18">“If ye receive a different Spirit, if a different
Gospel which ye did not accept, ye do well to bear” with him.
What sayest thou? Thou that saidst to the Galatians, “If any
preach another Gospel to you than that ye have received, let him be
anathema;” dost thou now say, “ye do well to bear” with
him? And yet on this account it were meet not to bear with, but
to recoil, from them; but if they say the same things, it is meet
to bear with them. How then dost thou say, ‘because they say
the same things, it is not meet to bear with them?’ for he says,
‘if they said other things, it were meet to bear with them.’
Let us then give good heed, for the danger is great, and the
precipice deep, if men run past this carelessly; and what is here
said giveth an entrance to all the heresies. What then is the
sense of these words? Those persons so boasted as if the Apostles
taught incompletely, and they were introducing somewhat more than
they. For it is probable that with much idle talk, they were
bringing in senseless rubbish so as to overlay these doctrines.
And therefore he made mention of the serpent and of Eve who was
thus deceived by the expectation of acquiring more. And alluding
to this in the former Epistle also, he said, “Now ye are become
rich, ye have reigned as kings without us;” and again, “we are
fools for Christ’s sake, but ye are wise in Christ.” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. 4.8,10" id="v.xxiii-p18.1" parsed="|1Cor|4|8|0|0;|1Cor|4|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.4.8 Bible:1Cor.4.10">1 Cor.
iv. 8; ib. 10</scripRef>.) Since
then it was probable that using the wisdom which is without, they
talked much idly, <pb n="385" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_385.html" id="v.xxiii-Page_385" />what he
says is this: that ‘if these persons said any thing more, and
preached a different Christ who ought to have been preached, but we
omitted it, “ye do well to bear” with them.’ For on this
account he added, “whom we did not preach.” ‘But if the
chief points of the faith are the same, what have ye the more of
them? for whatsoever things they may say, they will say nothing
more than what we have said.’ And observe with what precision
he states the case. For he did not say, ‘if he that cometh
saith any thing more;’ for they did say something more,
haranguing with more authority and with much beauty of language;
wherefore he did not say this, but what? [If] “he that cometh
preacheth another Jesus,” a thing which had no need of that array
of words: “or ye receive a different Spirit,” (for neither
was there need of words in this case;) that is to say, ‘makes you
richer in grace;’ or “a different Gospel which ye did not
accept,” (nor did this again stand in need of words,) “ye do
well to bear” with him. But consider, I pray thee, how he every
where uses such a definition as shows that nothing very great, nor
indeed any thing more, had been introduced by them. For when he
had said, “If he that cometh preacheth another Jesus,” he
added, “whom we did not preach;” and “ye receive a different
Spirit,” he subjoined, “which ye did not receive; or a
different Gospel,” he added, “which ye did not accept,” by
all these showing that it is meet to attend to them, not simply if
they say something more, but if they said any thing more which
ought to have been said and was by us omitted. But if it ought
not to have been said, and was therefore not said by us; or if they
say only the same things as we, why gape ye so admiringly<note place="end" n="922" id="v.xxiii-p18.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxiii-p19"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxiii-p19.1">κεχήνατε</span>.</p></note> upon them? 
‘And yet if they say the same things,’ saith one, ‘wherefore
dost thou hinder them?’ Because that using hypocrisy, they
introduce strange doctrines. This however for the present he doth
not say, but afterwards asserts it, when he says, “They fashion
themselves into Apostles of Christ;” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. 11.13" id="v.xxiii-p19.2" parsed="|2Cor|11|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.11.13">ver.
13</scripRef>.) for the present he
withdraws the disciples from their authority by less offensive
considerations; and this not out of envy to them, but to secure
these. Else why does he not hinder Apollos, who was, however, a
“learned man, and mighty in the Scriptures;” (<scripRef passage="Acts xviii. 24; 1 Cor. xvi. 12" id="v.xxiii-p19.3" parsed="|Acts|18|24|0|0;|1Cor|16|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.18.24 Bible:1Cor.16.12">Acts xviii. 24; 1 Cor. xvi.
12</scripRef>.) but even beseeches
him, and promises he will send him? Because together with his
learning he preserved also the integrity of the doctrines; but with
these it was the reverse. And therefore he wars with them and
blames the disciples for gaping admiringly upon them, saying, ‘if
aught that should have been said we omitted and they supplied, we
do not hinder you from giving heed to them: but if all has been
fully completed by us and nothing left deficient, whence is it that
they caught you?’ Wherefore also he adds,</p>

I am not a whit behind the very chiefest Apostles,” no longer
making comparison of himself with them, but with Peter and the
rest. ‘So that if they know more than I do, [they know more]
than they also.’ And observe how here also he shows modesty.
For he did not say, ‘the Apostles said nothing more than I,’
but what? “I reckon,” so I deem, “that I am not a whit
behind the very chiefest Apostles.” For since this also
appeared to bespeak an inferiority in him, that those having
preceded him were of greater name; and more respect was entertained
for them, and these persons were intending to foist themselves in;
therefore he makes this comparison of himself with them with the
dignity<note place="end" n="923" id="v.xxiii-p20.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxiii-p21"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxiii-p21.1">σχήματος</span>.</p></note> that becomes
him. Therefore he also mentions them with encomiums, not speaking
simply of “the Apostles,” but “the very chiefest,” meaning
Peter and James and John.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxiii-p22">[3.] <scripRef passage="2 Cor. 11.6" id="v.xxiii-p22.1" parsed="|2Cor|11|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.11.6">Ver. 6</scripRef>. “But though I be rude in
speech, yet am I not in knowledge.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxiii-p23">For since those that corrupted the Corinthians
had the advantage in this, that they were not rude; he mentions
this also, showing that he was not ashamed of, but even prided
himself upon it. And he said not, “But though I be rude in
speech,” yet so also are they<note place="end" n="924" id="v.xxiii-p23.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxiii-p24"> i.e. Peter &amp;c.</p></note>, for this would have seemed to be
accusing them as well as himself, and exalting these: but he
overthrows the thing itself, the wisdom from without. And indeed
in his former Epistle he contends even vehemently about this thing,
saying that it not only contributes nothing to the Preaching, but
it even throws a shadow on the glory of the Cross; (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. ii. 1" id="v.xxiii-p24.1" parsed="|1Cor|2|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.2.1">1 Cor. ii. 1</scripRef>.) for he says, “I came not
with excellency of speech or of wisdom unto you, lest the cross of
Christ should be made void; (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. i. 17" id="v.xxiii-p24.2" parsed="|1Cor|1|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.1.17">1 Cor. i. 17</scripRef>.) and many other things of the
same kind; because “in knowledge” they were “rude,” which
is also the extremest form of rudeness. When therefore it was
necessary to institute a comparison in those things which were
great, he compares himself with the Apostles: but when to show
that which appeared to be a deficiency, he no longer does this, but
grapples with the thing itself and shows that it was a
superiority. And when indeed no necessity urged him, he says that
he is “the least of the Apostles,” and not worthy even of the
title; but here again when occasion called, he says that he is
“not a whit behind the very chiefest Apostles.” For he knew
that this would most advantage the disciples. Wherefore also he
adds,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxiii-p25"><pb n="386" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_386.html" id="v.xxiii-Page_386" />“Nay, in every
thing we have made it manifest among all men to youward.” For
here again he accuses the false Apostles as “walking in
craftiness.” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. 4.2" id="v.xxiii-p25.1" parsed="|2Cor|4|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.4.2">Chap. iv. 2</scripRef>.) And he said this of
himself before also, that he did not live after the outward
appearance, nor preach “handling the word deceitfully (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. 4.2" id="v.xxiii-p25.2" parsed="|2Cor|4|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.4.2">ibid.</scripRef>) and corrupting it. But
those men were one thing and appeared another. But not so he.
Wherefore also he every where assumes a high tone, as doing nothing
with a view to men’s opinion nor concealing aught about
himself. As he also said before, “by the manifestation of the
truth commending ourselves to every man’s conscience,” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. 4.2" id="v.xxiii-p25.3" parsed="|2Cor|4|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.4.2">ibid.</scripRef>) so now again he saith “in
every thing we have made it manifest to you.” But what does
this mean? ‘We are rude,’ he said, ‘and do not conceal
it: we receive from some persons and we do not keep it secret.
We receive then from you, and we pretend not that we do not
receive, as they do when they receive, but we make every thing that
we do manifest unto you;’ which was the conduct of one that both
had exceeding confidence in them, and told them every thing
truly. Wherefore he also calls them witnesses, saying now,
“among all men to youward,” and also before, “For we write
none other things unto you, than what ye read or even
acknowledge.” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. 1.13" id="v.xxiii-p25.4" parsed="|2Cor|1|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.1.13">Chap. i. 13</scripRef>.)</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxiii-p26">[4.] Then after he had defended his own conduct he
goes on next to say with severity,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxiii-p27"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 11.7" id="v.xxiii-p27.1" parsed="|2Cor|11|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.11.7">Ver. 7</scripRef>.
“Or did I commit a sin in abasing myself that ye might be
exalted?”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxiii-p28">And in explanation of this, he adds,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxiii-p29"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 11.8" id="v.xxiii-p29.1" parsed="|2Cor|11|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.11.8">Ver. 8</scripRef>.
“I robbed other churches, taking wages of them that I might
minister unto you.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxiii-p30">What he says is this; ‘I lived in straitness;’
for this is the force of “abasing myself.” ‘Can you then
lay this to my charge? and do ye therefore lift up yourselves
against me, because I abased myself by begging, by enduring
straits, by suffering, by hungering, that ye might be exalted?’
And how were they exalted by his being in straits? They were more
edified and were not offended; which also might [well] be a very
great accusation of them and a reproach of their weakness; that it
was not possible in any other way to lead them on than by first
abasing himself. ‘Do ye then lay it to my charge that I abased
myself? But thereby ye were exalted.’ For since he said even
above that they accused him, for that when present he was lowly,
and when absent bold, in defending himself he here strikes them
again, saying, ‘this too was for your sakes.’</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxiii-p31">“I robbed other churches.” Here finally he
speaks reproachfully, but his former words prevent these from
seeming offensive; for he said, “Bear with me in a little
foolishness:” and before all his other achievements makes this
his first boast. For this worldly men look to especially, and on
this also those his adversaries greatly prided themselves.
Therefore it is that he does not first enter on the subject of his
perils, nor yet of his miracles, but on this of his contempt of
money, because they prided themselves on this; and at the same time
he also hints that they were wealthy. But what is to be admired
in him is this, that when he was able to say that he was even
supported by his own hands, he did not say this; but says that
which especially shamed them and yet was no encomium on himself,
namely, ‘I took from others.’ And he did not say “took,”
but “robbed,” that is, ‘I stripped them, and made them
poor.’ And what surely is greater, that it was not for
superfluities, but for his necessities, for when he says
‘wages,’ he means necessary subsistence. And what is more
grievous yet, “to minister unto you.” We preach to you; and
when I ought to be supported by you, I have enjoyed this at
others’ hands. The accusation is twofold, or rather three-fold;
that when both living amongst them and ministering to them, and
seeking necessary support, he had others supplying his wants.
Great the excess, of the one negligence, of the other in zeal! 
For these sent to him even when at a great distance, and those did
not even support him when amongst them.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxiii-p32">[5.] Then because he had vehemently scourged them,
he quietly again relaxes the vehemence of his rebuke, saying,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxiii-p33"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 11.9" id="v.xxiii-p33.1" parsed="|2Cor|11|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.11.9">Ver. 9</scripRef>.
“And when I was present with you, and was in want, I was not a
burden on any man.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxiii-p34">For he did not say, ‘ye did not give to me,’
but, ‘I did not take,’ for as yet he spares them. But
nevertheless even in the subduedness of his language he covertly
strikes them again, for the word, “present,” is exceedingly
emphatic, and so is “in want.” For that they might not say,
‘what matter then, if you had [enough]?’ he added, “and was
in want.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxiii-p35">“I was not a burden” on you. Here again
he hits them gently, as making such contributions reluctantly, as
feeling them a burden. Then comes the reason also, full of
accusation and fraught with jealousy. Wherefore also he
introduced it, not in the way of a leading point<note place="end" n="925" id="v.xxiii-p35.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxiii-p36"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxiii-p36.1">οὐ προηγουμένως</span>.</p></note>, but as informing them whence and
by whom he was supported, so as to stimulate them again, in an
unsuspicious way, as to the point of almsgiving;</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxiii-p37">“For the measure of my want,” he says, “the
brethren which came from Macedonia supplied.” Seest thou how he
provokes them again, by bringing forward those that had ministered
to him? For inspiring them first 
<pb n="387" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_387.html" id="v.xxiii-Page_387" />with a desire of knowing who these could be, when
he said, “I robbed other churches;” he then mentions them also
by name; which would incite them also unto almsgiving. For he
thus persuades those who had been beaten [by them] in the matter of
supporting the Apostle, not to be also beaten in the succor they
gave to the poor. And he says this also in his Epistle to the
Macedonians themselves, “For in my necessities ye sent unto me
once and again, even in the beginning of the Gospel;” (<scripRef passage="Philip. iv. 16, 15" id="v.xxiii-p37.1" parsed="|Phil|4|16|0|0;|Phil|4|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Phil.4.16 Bible:Phil.4.15">Philip. iv. 16, 15</scripRef>.) which point also was a
very great commendation of them, that from the very beginning they
shone forth. But observe how everywhere he mentions his
“necessity,” and no where a superfluity. Now therefore by
saying “present,” and in “want” he showed that he ought to
have been supported by the Corinthians; and by the words, “they
supplied the measure of my want,” he shows that he did not so
much as ask. And he assigns a reason which was not the real
one. What then is this? That he had received from others;
“for,” says he, “the measure of my want those that came
supplied.” ‘For this reason,’ he says, ‘I was not a
burden; not because I had no confidence in you.’ And yet it is
for this latter reason that he so acts, and he shows it in what
follows; but does not say it plainly, but throws it into the
shade<note place="end" n="926" id="v.xxiii-p37.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxiii-p38"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxiii-p38.1">συσκιάζει</span>.</p></note>, leaving it
to the conscience of his hearers. And he gives proof of it
covertly in what follows, by saying,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxiii-p39">“And in every” thing “I kept myself from being
burdensome, and so will I keep” myself. “For think not,”
says he, “that I say these things that I may receive.” Now
the words “so will I keep myself,” are severer, if he has not
even yet confidence in them; but once for all had given up the idea
of receiving aught from them. He shows, moreover, that they even
considered this to be a burden; wherefore he said, “I have kept
myself from being burdensome, and so will I keep myself.” He
says this in his former Epistle also, “I write not this that it
may be so done unto me; for” it were “good for me rather to
die, than that any man should make my glorying void.” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. ix. 15" id="v.xxiii-p39.1" parsed="|1Cor|9|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.9.15">1 Cor. ix. 15</scripRef>.) And here again, “I have
kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and so will I keep”
myself.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxiii-p40">[6.] Then, that he may not seem to speak these
things for the sake of winning them on the better [to do this], he
saith,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxiii-p41"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 11.10" id="v.xxiii-p41.1" parsed="|2Cor|11|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.11.10">Ver. 10</scripRef>. “As the truth of Christ
is in me.” ‘Do not think that I therefore have spoken, that I
may receive, that I may the rather draw you on: for,’ saith he,
“as the truth is in me,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxiii-p42">“No man shall stop me of this glorying in
the regions of Achaia.” For that none should think again that
he is grieved at this, or that he speaks these things in anger, he
even calls the thing a “glorying.” And in his former Epistle
too he dressed it out<note place="end" n="927" id="v.xxiii-p42.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxiii-p43"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxiii-p43.1">κατεσκεύαζεν</span>.</p></note> in like terms. For so that he may
not wound them there either, he says, “What then is my
reward?” “That when I preach the Gospel, I may make the
Gospel of Christ without charge.” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. ix. 18" id="v.xxiii-p43.2" parsed="|1Cor|9|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.9.18">1 Cor. ix. 18</scripRef>.) And as he there
calls it “reward,” so doth he here “glorying,” that they
may not be excessively ashamed at what he said, as if he were
asking and they gave not to him. ‘For, what, if even ye would
give?’ saith he, ‘Yet I do not accept it.’ And the
expression, “shall not stop me,” is a metaphor taken from
rivers, or from the report, as if running every where, of his
receiving nothing. ‘Ye stop not with your giving this my
freedom of speech.’ But he said not, ‘ye stop not,’ which
would have been too<note place="end" n="928" id="v.xxiii-p43.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxiii-p44"> Or, “more.”</p></note> cutting, but it “no man shall
stop me in the regions of Achaia.” This again was like giving
them a fatal blow, and exceedingly apt to deject and pain them,
since they were the only persons he refused [to take from].
‘For if he made that his boast, it were meet to make it so every
where: but if he only does so among us, perchance this is owing
to our weakness.’ Lest therefore they should so reason and be
dejected, see how he corrects this.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxiii-p45"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 11.11" id="v.xxiii-p45.1" parsed="|2Cor|11|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.11.11">Ver. 11</scripRef>. “Wherefore? because I
love you not? God knoweth.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxiii-p46">Quickly [is it done], and by an easy method<note place="end" n="929" id="v.xxiii-p46.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxiii-p47"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxiii-p47.1">εὐαπαλλάκτως</span>.</p></note>. But
still, not even so did he rid them of those charges. For he
neither said, ‘ye are not weak,’ nor yet, ‘ye are strong;’
but, “I love you,” which very greatly aggravated the accusation
against them. For the not receiving from them, because they felt
it an exceeding grievance, was a proof of special love toward
them. So he acted in two contrary ways out of love; he both did
receive, and did not receive: but this contrariety was on account
of the disposition of the givers. And he did not say, ‘I
therefore do not take of you, because I exceedingly love you,’
for this would have contained an accusation of their weakness and
have thrown them into distress; but he turned what he said to
another reason. What then is this?</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxiii-p48"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 11.12" id="v.xxiii-p48.1" parsed="|2Cor|11|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.11.12">Ver. 12</scripRef>. “That I may cut off
occasion from them that desire an occasion; that wherein they
glory, they may be found even as we.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxiii-p49">For since this they sought earnestly, to find
some handle<note place="end" n="930" id="v.xxiii-p49.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxiii-p50"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxiii-p50.1">σεμνύνονται</span>.</p></note> against him,
it is necessary to remove this also. For this is the one point on
which they pique themselves. Therefore that <pb n="388" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_388.html" id="v.xxiii-Page_388" />they might not have any advantage
whatever, it was necessary to set this right; for in other things
they were inferior. For, as I have said, nothing doth so edify
worldly people as the receiving nothing from them. Therefore the
devil in his craftiness dropped this bait especially, when desirous
to injure them in other respects. But it appears to me that this
even was in hypocrisy. And therefore he did not say, ‘wherein
they have well done,’ but what? “wherein they glory;” which
also was as jeering at their glorying; for they gloried also of
that which they were not. But the man of noble spirit not only
ought not to boast of what he has not, but not even of what he
possesses; as this blessed saint was wont to do, as the patriarch
Abraham did, saying, “But I am earth and ashes.” (<scripRef passage="Gen. xviii. 27" id="v.xxiii-p50.2" parsed="|Gen|18|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.18.27">Gen. xviii. 27</scripRef>.) For since he had no sins
to speak of, but shone with good works; having run about in every
direction and found no very great handle against himself, he
betakes himself to his nature; and since the name of “earth” is
in some way or other one of dignity, he added to it that of
“ashes.” Wherefore also another saith, “Why is earth and
ashes proud?” (<scripRef passage="Ecclesiasticus 10.9" id="v.xxiii-p50.3" parsed="|Sir|10|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Sir.10.9">Ecclus. x. 9</scripRef>.)</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxiii-p51">[7.] For tell me not of the bloom of the
countenance, nor of the uplifted neck, nor of the mantle, and the
horse, and the followers; but reflect where all these things do
end, and put that to them. But and if thou tell me of what
appears to the eye, I too will tell thee of things in pictures,
brighter far than these.  But as we do not admire those for their
appearance, as seeing what their nature is, that all is clay; so
therefore let us not these either, for these too are but clay.
Yea rather, even before they are dissolved and become dust, show me
this uplifted [neck] a prey to fever and gasping out life; and then
will I discourse with thee and will ask, What has become of all
that profuse ornament? whither has that crowd of flatterers
vanished, that attendance of slaves, that abundance of wealth and
possessions? What wind hath visited and blown all away? Nay,
even stretched upon the bier, he beareth the tokens of that wealth
and that pride; a splendid garment thrown over him, poor and rich
following him forth, the assembled crowds breathing words of good
omen<note place="end" n="931" id="v.xxiii-p51.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxiii-p52"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxiii-p52.1">εὐφημούντων</span>.</p></note>. Surely
this also is a very mockery; howbeit even this besides is presently
proved naught, like a blossom that perishes. For when we have
passed over the threshold of the city gates, and after having
delivered over the body to the worms, return, I will ask thee
again, where is that vast crowd gone to? What has become of the
clamor and uproar? where are the torches? where the bands of women?
are not these things, then, a dream? And what too has become of
the shouts? where are those many lips that cried, and bade him
‘be of good cheer, for no man is immortal?’ These things
ought not now to be said to one that heareth not, but when he made
prey of others, when he was overreaching, then with a slight change
should it have been said to him, ‘Be not of good cheer, no man is
immortal; hold in thy madness, extinguish thy lust;’ but ‘Be of
good cheer’ is for the injured party. For to chant such things
over this man now, is but like men exulting over him and speaking
irony; for he ought not for this now to be of good cheer, but to
fear and tremble.</p>

small part of our debt by bearing what is done to us nobly. We
receive therefore no injury; for God reckons the ill-treatment
towards our debt, not according to the principle of justice but of
His loving-kindness; and because He succored not him that suffered
evil. ‘Whence doth this appear?’ saith one. The Jews once
suffered evil at the hand of the Babylonians; and God did not
prevent it: but they were carried away, children and women; yet
afterwards did this captivity become a consolation to them in

a poor, leave him that suffereth wrong, and weep for the
plunderer. For the one putteth off filth, the other bedaubeth
himself with more filth. Such was the fate of Elisha’s servant

For though he took not by violence, yet he did a wrong; for to get
money by deceit is a wrong. What then befel? With the wrong he
received also the leprosy; and he that was wronged was benefited,
but he that did the wrong received the greatest possible harm.
The same happens now also in the case of the soul. And this is of
so great force that often by itself it hath propitiated God; yea
though he who suffereth evil be unworthy of aid; yet when he so
suffers in excess, by this alone he draweth God unto the
forgiveness of himself, and to the punishment of him that did the
wrong. Wherefore also God said of old to the heathen, “I indeed
delivered them over unto a few things, but they have set themselves
on together unto evil things;” (<scripRef passage="Zech. i. 15" id="v.xxiii-p56.2" parsed="|Zech|1|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Zech.1.15">Zech. i. 15</scripRef>. LXX.) they shall suffer
ills irremediable<note place="end" n="934" id="v.xxiii-p56.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxiii-p57"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxiii-p57.1">ἀ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.xxiii-p57.2">νήκεστα</span>.</p></note>. For there
is nothing, no, nothing, that doth so much exasperate God as rapine
and violence and extortion. And why forsooth? Because it is
very easy to abstain from this sin. For here it is not any
natural desire that perturbeth the mind, but it ariseth from wilful
negligence<note place="end" n="935" id="v.xxiii-p57.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxiii-p58"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxiii-p58.1">ῥ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.xxiii-p58.2">αθυμίας</span>.</p></note>. How then
doth the Apostle call it, “a root of evils.” (<scripRef passage="1 Tim. vi. 10" id="v.xxiii-p58.3" parsed="|1Tim|6|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.6.10">1 Tim. vi. 10</scripRef>.) Why, I say so too,
but this root is from us, and not from the nature of the things.
And, if ye will, let us make a comparison and see which is the more
imperious, the desire of money or of beauty<note place="end" n="936" id="v.xxiii-p58.4"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxiii-p59"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxiii-p59.1">σωμάτων</span>.</p></note>; for that which shall be found to
have struck down great men is the more difficult to master. Let
us see then what great man the desire of money ever got possession
of. Not one; only of exceeding pitiful and abject persons,
Gehazi, Ahab, Judas, the priests of the Jews: but the desire for
beauty overcame even the great prophet David. And this I say, not
as extending forgiveness to those who are conquered by such a lust,
but rather, as preparing them to be watchful. For when I have
shown the strength of the passion, then, most especially, I show
them to be deprived of every claim to forgiveness. For if indeed
thou hadst not known the wild beast, thou wouldest have this to
take refuge in; but now, having known, yet falling into it, thou
wilt have no excuse. After him<note place="end" n="937" id="v.xxiii-p59.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxiii-p60"> David.</p></note>, it took possession of his son
still more completely. And yet there was never man wiser than he,
and all other virtue did he attain; still, however, he was seized
so violently by this passion, that even in his vitals he received
the wound. And the father indeed rose up again and renewed the
struggle, and was crowned again; but the son showed nothing of the
kind.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxiii-p61">Therefore also Paul said, “It is better to marry
than to burn:” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. vii. 9" id="v.xxiii-p61.1" parsed="|1Cor|7|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.7.9">1 Cor.
vii. 9</scripRef>.) and Christ,
“He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.” (<scripRef passage="Matt. xiv. 12" id="v.xxiii-p61.2" parsed="|Matt|14|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.14.12">Matt. xiv. 12</scripRef>.) But concerning money He
spake not so, but, “whoso hath forsaken” his goods “shall
receive an hundredfold.” (<scripRef passage="Matt. 14.29" id="v.xxiii-p61.3" parsed="|Matt|14|29|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.14.29">ib. 29</scripRef>.) ‘How then,’ saith one,
‘did He say of the rich, that they shall hardly obtain the
kingdom?’ Again implying their weakness of character; not the
imperiousness of money, but their utter slavery. And this is
evident also from the advice which Paul gave. For from that lust
he leads men quite away, saying, “But they that desire to be rich
fall into temptation;” (<scripRef passage="1 Tim. vi. 9" id="v.xxiii-p61.4" parsed="|1Tim|6|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.6.9">1 Tim. vi. 9</scripRef>.) but in the case of the other
not so; but having separated them “for a season” only, and that
by “consent,” he advises to ‘come together again’ (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. vii. 5" id="v.xxiii-p61.5" parsed="|1Cor|7|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.7.5">1 Cor. vii. 5</scripRef>.) For he feared the
billows of lust lest they should occasion a grievous shipwreck.
This passion is even more vehement<note place="end" n="938" id="v.xxiii-p61.6"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxiii-p62"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxiii-p62.1">εὕτονώτερον</span>.</p></note> than anger. For it is not
possible to feel anger when there is nothing<note place="end" n="939" id="v.xxiii-p62.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxiii-p63"> Or, ‘no one.’</p></note> proving it, but a man cannot help
desiring even when the face which moveth to it is not seen.
Therefore this passion indeed He did not cut off altogether, but
added the words, “without a cause.” (<scripRef passage="Matt. v. 22" id="v.xxiii-p63.1" parsed="|Matt|5|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.22">Matt. v. 22</scripRef>.) Nor again did He
abolish all desire, but only that which is unlawful, for he saith,
“Nevertheless, because of desires<note place="end" n="940" id="v.xxiii-p63.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxiii-p64"> S. Chrysostom here reads, ‘because of desires
<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxiii-p64.1">ἐπιθυμιαίς</span>,
instead of, ‘because of fornication,’ <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxiii-p64.2"> πορνείας</span>, with the Rec. Text, [which is correct. C.]</p></note>, let every man have his own
wife.” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. vii. 2" id="v.xxiii-p64.3" parsed="|1Cor|7|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.7.2">1 Cor.
vii. 2</scripRef>.) But to lay up
treasure He allowed not, either with cause or without. For those
passions were implanted in our nature for a necessary end; desire,
for the procreation of children, and anger, for the succor of the
injured, but desire of money not so. Therefore neither is the
passion natural to us. So then if thou art made captive by it,
thou wilt suffer so much the more the vilest punishment.
Therefore surely, it is, that Paul, permitting even a second
marriage, demands in the case of money great strictness, saying,
“Why not rather take wrong? why not rather be defrauded?”
(<scripRef passage="1 Cor. vi. 7" id="v.xxiii-p64.4" parsed="|1Cor|6|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.6.7">1 Cor. vi. 7</scripRef>.) And when treating of
virginity, he says, “I have no commandment,” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. 7.25" id="v.xxiii-p64.5" parsed="|1Cor|7|25|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.7.25">ib. vii.
25</scripRef>.) and “I speak this
for your profit, not that I may cast a snare upon you;” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. 7.35" id="v.xxiii-p64.6" parsed="|1Cor|7|35|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.7.35">ib.
35</scripRef>.) but when his
discourse is of money, he says, “Having raiment and <pb n="390" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_390.html" id="v.xxiii-Page_390" />food, let us be therewith
content.” (<scripRef passage="1 Tim. vi. 8" id="v.xxiii-p64.7" parsed="|1Tim|6|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.6.8">1 Tim. vi.
8</scripRef>.) ‘How then
is it,’ saith one, ‘that by this, more than the other, are many
overcome?’ Because they stand not so much on their guard<note place="end" n="941" id="v.xxiii-p64.8"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxiii-p65"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxiii-p65.1">παραταττόμενοι</span>.</p></note> against it
as against lasciviousness and fornication; for if they had thought
it equally dangerous, they would not, perhaps, have been made its
captives. So also were those wretched virgins cast out of the
bridechamber, because that, having struck down the great adversary,
they were wounded<note place="end" n="942" id="v.xxiii-p65.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxiii-p66"> Al. <i>thrown</i>.</p></note> by one
weaker, and who was nothing. (<scripRef passage="Matt. xxv. 1" id="v.xxiii-p66.1" parsed="|Matt|25|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.25.1">Matt. xxv. 1</scripRef>, &amp;c.) Besides
this, one may say further, that if any, subduing lust, is overcome
by money, often<note place="end" n="943" id="v.xxiii-p66.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxiii-p67"> Or, <i>perhaps</i>.</p></note> he does not
in fact subdue lust, but has received from nature the gift of
suffering no great uneasiness of that sort; for all are not equally
inclined to it. Knowing then these things, and revolving
frequently with ourselves the example of the virgins, let us shun
this evil wild beast. For if virginity profited them nothing, but
after countless toils and labors they perished through the love of
money, who shall deliver us if we fall into this passion? 
Wherefore I beseech you to do all you can, both that ye be not
taken captive by it, and that if taken, ye continue not in
captivity, but break asunder those hard bonds. For so shall we be
able to secure a footing in heaven and to obtain the countless good
things; whereunto may all we attain, through the grace and love
towards men of our Lord Jesus Christ, with Whom to the Father, with
the Holy Ghost, be glory, might, honor, now and for ever, and world
without end. Amen.</p>

<p class="c27" id="v.xxiv-p3">For such are false apostles, deceitful workers,

preach Christ, they that take not money, they that bring not in a

for this very reason most of all, because they make pretense of all
these things for the purpose of deceiving. “Deceitful
workers,” for they do work indeed, but pull up what has been
planted. For being well aware that otherwise they would not be
well received, they take the mask of truth and so enact the drama
of error. ‘And yet,’ saith one, ‘they take no money.’
That they may take greater things; that they may destroy the
soul. Yea rather, even that was a falsehood; and they took money
but did it secretly: and he shows this in what follows. And
indeed he already hinted this where he said, “that wherein they
glory, they may be found even as we:” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. 11.12" id="v.xxiv-p4.2" parsed="|2Cor|11|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.11.12">ver.

however, he hinted it more plainly, saying, “If a man devour you,
if a man take you captive, if a man exalt himself, ye bear with
him.” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. 11.20" id="v.xxiv-p4.3" parsed="|2Cor|11|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.11.20">ver. 20</scripRef>.) But at present he
accuses them on another account, saying, “fashioning
themselves.” They had only a “fashion;” the skin of the
sheep was but outside clothing<note place="end" n="944" id="v.xxiv-p4.4"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxiv-p5"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxiv-p5.1">ἐ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.xxiv-p5.2">πικεἵται</span>.</p></note>.</p>

even Satan fashioneth himself into an angel of light, is it a great
thing if his ministers also fashion themselves as ministers of
righteousness?”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxiv-p7">So that if one ought to marvel, this is what
he ought to marvel at, and not at their transformation. For when
their teacher dares do any thing, no marvel that the disciples also
follow. But what is “an angel of light?” That hath free
liberty to speak, that standeth near to God. For there are also
angels of darkness; those which be the devil’s, those dark and
cruel ones. And the devil hath deceived many so, fashioning
himself “into,” not becoming, “an angel of light.” So do
also do these bear about them the form of an Apostle, not the power
itself, for this they cannot. But nothing is so like the devil<note place="end" n="945" id="v.xxiv-p7.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxiv-p8"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxiv-p8.1">διαβολικὸν</span>.</p></note> as to do
things for display. But what is “a ministry of
righteousness?” That which we are who preach to you a Gospel
having righteousness. For he either means this, or else that they
invest themselves with the character of righteous men. How then
shall we know them? “By their works,” as Christ said.
Wherefore he is compelled to place his own good deeds and their
wickedness side by side, that the spurious may become evident by
the comparison. And when about again to enter upon his own
praises, he first accuses them, in order to show that such an
argument was forced upon him, lest any should accuse him for
speaking about himself, and says,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxiv-p9"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 11.16" id="v.xxiv-p9.1" parsed="|2Cor|11|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.11.16">Ver. 16</scripRef>. “Again I say.”  For he
had even <pb n="391" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_391.html" id="v.xxiv-Page_391" />already used much
preparatory corrective: ‘But nevertheless I am not contented
with what I have said, but I say yet again,’</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxiv-p10">“Let no man think me foolish.” For this
was what they did—boasted without a reason.—But observe, I pray
you, how often, when about to enter upon his own praises, he checks
himself<note place="end" n="946" id="v.xxiv-p10.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxiv-p11"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxiv-p11.1">ἀ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.xxiv-p11.2">νακρούεται</span>.</p></note>. ‘For
indeed it is the act of folly,’ he says, ‘to boast: but I do
it, not as playing the fool, but because compelled. But if ye do
not believe me, but though ye see there is a necessity will condemn
me; not even so will I decline the task<note place="end" n="947" id="v.xxiv-p11.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxiv-p12"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxiv-p12.1">παραιτήσομαι</span>.</p></note>.’ Seest thou how he showed that
there was great necessity for his speaking. For he that shunned
not even this suspicion, consider what violent impulsion to speak
he must have undergone, how he travailed and was constrained to
speak. But, nevertheless, even so he employs this thing with
moderation. For he did not say, ‘that I may glory.’ And
when about to do “a little,” again he uses yet another
deprecatory expression<note place="end" n="948" id="v.xxiv-p12.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxiv-p13"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxiv-p13.1">παραιτήσει</span>.</p></note>, saying,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxiv-p14"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 11.17" id="v.xxiv-p14.1" parsed="|2Cor|11|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.11.17">Ver. 17</scripRef>. “That which I speak, I
speak not after the Lord, but as in foolishness, in this confidence
of glorifying.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxiv-p15">Seest thou how glorying is not “after the
Lord?” For He saith, “When ye shall have done all, say, We
are unprofitable servants.” (<scripRef passage="Luke xvii. 10" id="v.xxiv-p15.1" parsed="|Luke|17|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.17.10">Luke xvii. 10</scripRef>.) Howbeit, by itself indeed
it is not “after the Lord,” but by the intention it becomes
so. And therefore he said, “That which I speak,” not accusing
the motive, but the words. Since his aim is so admirable as to
dignify the words also. For as a manslayer, though his action be
of those most strictly forbidden, has often been approved from the
intention; and as circumcision, although it is not ‘after the
Lord,’ has become so from the intention, so also glorying. And
wherefore then does he not use so great strictness of expression? 
Because he is hastening on to another point, and he freely
gratifies even to superfluity those who are desirous to find a
handle against him, so that he may say only the things that are
profitable; for when said they were enough to extinguish all that
suspicion. “But as in foolishness.” Before he says,
“Would that ye could bear with me in a little foolishness,’’
(<scripRef passage="2 Cor. 11.4" id="v.xxiv-p15.2" parsed="|2Cor|11|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.11.4">ver. 4</scripRef>.)
but now “as in foolishness;” for the farther he proceeds, the
more he clears his language. Then that thou mayest not think that
he plays the fool on all points, he added, “in this confidence of
glorying.” In this particular he means: just as in another
place he said, “that we be not put to shame,” and added, “in
this confidence of glorying.” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. 9.4" id="v.xxiv-p15.3" parsed="|2Cor|9|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.9.4">Chap. ix. 4</scripRef>.) And again, in another
place, having said, “Or what I purpose do I purpose according to
the flesh, that with me there should be the yea yea, and the nay
nay?” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. 1.17" id="v.xxiv-p15.4" parsed="|2Cor|1|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.1.17">Chap. i. 17</scripRef>.) And having shown that he
cannot in all cases even fulfil what he promises, because he does
not purpose after the flesh, lest any should make this suspicion
stretch to the doctrine also, he adds, “But as God is faithful
our word towards you was not yea and nay.” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. 1.18" id="v.xxiv-p15.5" parsed="|2Cor|1|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.1.18">Ibid.
18</scripRef>.)</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxiv-p16">[2.] And observe how after having said so many
things before, he again sets down yet other grounds of excuse,
saying further thus,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxiv-p17"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 11.18" id="v.xxiv-p17.1" parsed="|2Cor|11|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.11.18">Ver. 18</scripRef>. “Seeing that many glory
after the flesh, I will glory also.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxiv-p18">What is, “after the flesh?” Of things
external, of high birth, of wealth, of wisdom, of being
circumcised, of Hebrew ancestry, of popular renown. And behold
wisdom. He sets down those things which he shows to be nothings<note place="end" n="949" id="v.xxiv-p18.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxiv-p19"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxiv-p19.1">οὐδένα</span>.</p></note>, and then,
folly also. For if to glory in what are really good things be
folly, much more is it so [to glory in] those that are nothing.
And this is what he calls, “not after the Lord.” For it is no
advantage to be a Hebrew, or any such like things soever.
‘Think not, therefore, that I set these down as a virtue; no; but
because those men boast I also am compelled to institute my
comparison on these points.’ Which he does also in another
place, saying, “If any man thinketh that he may trust in the
flesh, I more:” (<scripRef passage="Philip. iii. 4" id="v.xxiv-p19.2" parsed="|Phil|3|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Phil.3.4">Philip. iii. 4</scripRef>.) and there, it is on their
account that trusted in this. Just as if one who was come of an
illustrious race but had chosen a philosophic life, should see
others priding themselves greatly on being well-born; and being
desirious of taking down their vanity, should be compelled to speak
of his own distinction; not to adorn himself, but to humble them;
so, truly, does Paul also do. Then leaving those, he empties all
his censure upon the Corinthians, saying,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxiv-p20"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 11.19" id="v.xxiv-p20.1" parsed="|2Cor|11|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.11.19">Ver. 19</scripRef>. “For ye bear with the
foolish gladly.” ‘So that ye are to blame for this, and more
than they. For if ye had not borne with them, and so far as it
lay in them received damage, I would not have spoken a word; but I
do it out of a tender care for your salvation, and in
condescension. And behold, how he accompanies even his censure
with praise. For having said, “ye bear with the foolish
gladly;” he added,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxiv-p21">“Being wise yourselves.” For it was a sign of
folly to glory, and on such matters. And yet it behoved to rebuke
them, and say, ‘Do not bear with the foolish;’ he does this,
however, at greater advantage. For in that case he would have
seemed to rebuke them because he himself was destitute of these
advantages; but now having showed himself to be their superior
<pb n="392" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_392.html" id="v.xxiv-Page_392" />even in these points, and to
esteem them to be nothing, he corrects them with greater effect.
At present, however, before entering upon his own praises and the
comparison, he also reproaches the Corinthians with their great
slavishness, because they were extravagantly submissive to them.
And observe how he ridicules them.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxiv-p22"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 11.20" id="v.xxiv-p22.1" parsed="|2Cor|11|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.11.20">Ver. 20</scripRef>. “For ye bear with a
man,” he says, “if he devour you.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxiv-p23">How then saidst thou, “that wherein they glory,
they may be found even as we?” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. 11.12" id="v.xxiv-p23.1" parsed="|2Cor|11|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.11.12">ver. 12</scripRef>.) Seest thou that he shows
that they did take of them, and not simply take, but even in
excess: for the term “devour” plainly shows this,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxiv-p24">“If a man bring you into bondage.” ‘Ye have
given away both your money,’ he says, ‘and your persons, and
your freedom. For this is more than taking of you; to be masters
not only of your money, but of yourselves also.’ And he makes
this plain even before, where he says, “If others partake of this
right over you, do not we much more?” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. ix. 12" id="v.xxiv-p24.1" parsed="|1Cor|9|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.9.12">1 Cor. ix. 12</scripRef>.) Then he addeth what is
more severe, saying,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxiv-p25">“If a man exalt himself.” ‘For neither is
your slavery of a moderate sort, nor are your masters gentle, but
burdensome and odious.’</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxiv-p26">“If a man smite you on the face.” Seest thou
again a further stretch of tyranny? He said this, not meaning
that they were stricken on the face, but that they spat upon and
dishonored them; wherefore he added,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxiv-p27"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 11.21" id="v.xxiv-p27.1" parsed="|2Cor|11|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.11.21">Ver. 21</scripRef>. “I speak by way of
disparagement,” for ye suffer no whit less than men smitten on
the face. What now can be stronger than this? What oppression
more bitter than this? when having taken from you both your money

<p class="c19" id="v.xxiv-p29">“As though we had been weak.” The expression
is obscure. For since it was a disagreeable subject he therefore
so expressed it as to steal away the offensiveness by the
obscurity. For what he wishes to say is this. ‘For cannot we
also do these things? Yes, but we do them not. Wherefore then
do ye bear with these men, as though we could not do these
things? Surely it were something to impute to you that ye even
bear with men who play the fool; but that ye do this, even when
they so despise you, plunder you, exalt themselves, smite you, can
admit neither of excuse nor any reason at all. For this is a new
fashion of deceiving. For men that deceive both give and flatter;
but these both deceive, and take and insult you. Whence ye cannot
have a shadow of allowance, seeing that ye spit on those that
humble themselves for your sakes that ye may be exalted, but admire
those who exalt themselves that ye may be humbled. For could not
we too do these things? Yes, but we do not wish it, looking to
your advantage. For they indeed sacrificing your interests seek
their own, but we sacrificing our own interests seek for
yours.’ Seest thou how in every instance, whilst speaking
plainly to them, he also alarms them by what he says. ‘For,’
he says, ‘if it be on this account that ye honor them, because
they smite and insult you, we also can do this, enslave, smite,
exalt ourselves against you.’</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxiv-p30">[3.] Seest thou how he lays upon them the whole
blame, both of their senseless pride and of what seems to be folly
in himself. ‘For not that I may show myself more conspicuous,
but that I may set you free from this bitter slavery, am I
compelled to glory some little. But it is meet to examine not
simply things that are said, but, in addition, the reason also.
For Samuel also put together a high panegyric upon himself, when he
anointed Saul, saying, “Whose ass have I taken, or calf, or
shoes? or have I oppressed any of you?” (<scripRef passage="1 Sam. xii. 3" id="v.xxiv-p30.1" parsed="|1Sam|12|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Sam.12.3">1 Sam. xii. 3</scripRef>, LXX.) And yet no one finds
fault with him. And the reason is because he did not say it by
way of setting off himself; but because he was going to appoint a
king, he wishes under the form of a defence [of himself] to
instruct him to be meek and gentle. And observe the wisdom of the
prophet, or rather the loving kindness of God. For because he
wished to turn them from [their design,] bringing together a number
of grievous things he asserted them of their future king, as, for
instance, that he would make their wives grind at the mill, (<scripRef passage="1 Sam. viii. 11-18" id="v.xxiv-p30.2" parsed="|1Sam|8|11|8|18" osisRef="Bible:1Sam.8.11-1Sam.8.18">1 Sam. viii. 11–18</scripRef>.) the men shepherds and
muleteers; for he went through all the service appertaining to the
kingdom with minuteness. But when he saw that they would not be
hindered by any of these things, but were incurably distempered; he
thus both spareth them and composeth their king to gentleness.
(<scripRef passage="1 Sam. xii. 5" id="v.xxiv-p30.3" parsed="|1Sam|12|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Sam.12.5">1 Sam. xii. 5</scripRef>.) Therefore he also takes
him to witness. For indeed no one was then bringing suit or
charge against him that he needed to defend himself, but he said
those things in order to make him better. And therefore also he
added, to take down his pride, “If ye will hearken, ye and your
king,” (<scripRef passage="1 Sam. 12.14" id="v.xxiv-p30.4" parsed="|1Sam|12|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Sam.12.14">ibid. 14</scripRef>.) such and such good things
shall be yours; “but if ye will not hearken, then the reverse of
all.” Amos also said, “I was no prophet, nor the son of a
prophet, but only a herdsman, a gatherer of sycamore fruit. And
God took me.” (<scripRef passage="Amos vii. 14, 15" id="v.xxiv-p30.5" parsed="|Amos|7|14|7|15" osisRef="Bible:Amos.7.14-Amos.7.15">Amos
vii. 14, 15</scripRef>.) But he
did not say this to exalt himself, but to stop their mouths that
suspected him as no prophet, and to show that he is no deceiver,
nor says of <pb n="393" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_393.html" id="v.xxiv-Page_393" />his own mind the
things which he says. Again, another also, to show the very same
thing, said, “But truly I am full of power by the spirit and
might of the Lord.” (<scripRef passage="Micah iii. 8" id="v.xxiv-p30.6" parsed="|Mic|3|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Mic.3.8">Micah iii. 8</scripRef>.) And David also when he
related the matter of the lion and of the bear, (<scripRef passage="1 Sam. xvii. 34" id="v.xxiv-p30.7" parsed="|1Sam|17|34|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Sam.17.34">1 Sam. xvii. 34</scripRef>, &amp;c.) spake not to glorify
himself, but to bring about a great and admirable end. For since
it was not believed possible he could conquer the barbarian
unarmed, he that was not able even to bear arms; he was compelled
to give proofs of his own valor. And when he cut off Saul’s
skirt, he said not what he said out of display, but to repel an ill
suspicion which they had scattered abroad against him, saying, that
he wished to kill him. (<scripRef passage="1 Sam. xxiv. 4" id="v.xxiv-p30.8" parsed="|1Sam|24|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Sam.24.4">1 Sam. xxiv. 4</scripRef>, &amp;c.) It is meet
therefore every where to seek for the reason. For he that looks
to the advantage of his hearers even though he should praise
himself, not only deserves not to be found fault with, but even to
be crowned; and if he is silent, then to be found fault with. For
if David had then been silent in the matter of Goliath, they would
not have allowed him to go out to the battle, nor to have raised
that illustrious trophy. On this account then he speaks being
compelled; and that not to his brethren, although he was distrusted
by them too as well as by the king; but envy stopped their ears.
Therefore leaving them alone, he tells his tale to him who was not
as yet envious of him.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxiv-p31">[4.] For envy is a fearful, a fearful thing, and
persuades men to despise their own salvation. In this way did
both Cain destroy himself, and again, before his time, the devil
who was the destroyer of his father. So did Saul invite an evil
demon against his own soul; and when he had invited, he again
envied his physician. For such is the nature of envy; he knew
that he was saved, yet he would rather have perished than see him
that saved him had in honor. What can be more grievous than this
passion? One cannot err in calling it the devil’s offspring.
And in it is contained the fruit of vainglory, or rather its root
also; for both these evils are wont mutually to produce each
other. And thus in truth it was that Saul even thus envied, when
they said, “David smote by ten thousands,” (<scripRef passage="1 Sam. xviii. 7" id="v.xxiv-p31.1" parsed="|1Sam|18|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Sam.18.7">1 Sam. xviii. 7</scripRef>.) than which what can be more
senseless? For why dost thou envy? tell me!  ‘Because such an
one praised him?’ Yet surely thou oughtest to rejoice; besides,
thou dost not know even whether the praise be true. And dost thou
therefore grieve because without being admirable he hath been
praised as such? And yet thou oughtest to feel pity. For if he
be good, thou oughtest not to envy him when praised, but thyself to
praise along with those that speak well of him; but if not such,
why art thou galled? why thrust the sword against thyself? 
‘Because admired by men?’ But men to-day are and to-morrow
are not. ‘But because he enjoys glory?’ Of what sort, tell
me? That of which the prophet says that it is “the flower of
grass.” (<scripRef passage="Is. xl. 6" id="v.xxiv-p31.2" parsed="|Isa|40|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.40.6">Is. xl.
6</scripRef>. LXX.) Art thou
then therefore envious because thou bearest no burden, nor carriest
about with thee such loads of grass? But if he seems to thee to
be enviable on this account, then why not also woodcutters who
carry burdens every day and come to the city [with them]? For
that burden is nothing better than this, but even worse. For
theirs indeed galls the body only, but this hath oftentimes harmed
the soul even and occasioned greater solicitude than pleasure.
And should one have gained renown through eloquence, the fear he
endures is greater than the good report he bears; yea, what is
more, the one is short, the other perpetual. ‘But he is in
favor with those in authority?’ In that too again is danger and
envy. For as thou feelest towards him, so do many others feel.
‘But he is praised continually?’ This produces bitter
slavery. For he will not dare to do fearlessly aught of what
according to his judgment he should, lest he should offend those
that extol him, for that distinction is a hard bondage to him. So
that the more he is known to, so many the more masters he has, and
his slavery becomes the greater, as masters of his are found in
every quarter. A servant indeed, when he is released from the eye
of his master, both takes breath and lives in all freedom; but this
man meets with masters at every turn, for he is the slave of all
that appear in the forum. And even should some necessary object
press, he dares not set foot in the forum, except it be with his
servants following, and his horse, and all his other show set in
array, lest his masters condemn him. And if he sees some friend
of those who are truly so<note place="end" n="951" id="v.xxiv-p31.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxiv-p32"> Or ‘<i>worthy</i>.’</p></note>, he has not the boldness to talk
with him on an equal footing: for he is afraid of his masters,
lest they depose him from his glory. So that the more
distinguished he is, so much the more he is enslaved. And if he
suffer aught that is disagreeable, the insult is the more annoying,
both in that he has more to witness it and it seems to infringe his
dignity. It is not only an insult, but a calamity also, for he
has also many who exult at it; and in like way if he come to the
enjoyment of any good thing, he has more who envy and detract and
do their vigilance to destroy him. Is this then a good? tell
me. Is this glory? By no means; but ingloriousness, and
slavery, and bonds, and every burdensome thing one can say. But
if the glory that cometh of men be so greatly to be coveted in thy
account, and if <pb n="394" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_394.html" id="v.xxiv-Page_394" />it quite
disquiets thee that such and such an one is applauded of the many;
when thou beholdest him in the enjoyment of that applause, pass
over in thy thought to the world to come and the glory which is
there. And just as when hurrying to escape the onset of a wild
beast, thou enterest into a cabin and shuttest to the doors; so now
also flee unto the life to come, and that unspeakable glory. For
so shalt thou both tread this under thy feet, and wilt easily lay
hold upon that, and wilt enjoy the true liberty, and the eternal
good things; whereunto may we all attain through the grace and love
towards men of our Lord Jesus Christ, with Whom to the Father, with
the Holy Spirit, be glory, might, honor, now and ever, and world
without end. Amen.</p>

again, “Whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak in foolishness) I am

of himself, and that though there was a necessity, teaching us even
to an excess<note place="end" n="952" id="v.xxv-p4.6"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxv-p5"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxv-p5.1">ἐκ

also did the Pharisee meet the fate he did, and even in harbor
suffered shipwreck because he struck upon this rock. Therefore
also doth Paul, although he sees very ample necessity for it, draw
back nevertheless, and keep on observing that such speaking is a
mark of foolishness. And then at length he makes the venture<note place="end" n="953" id="v.xxv-p5.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxv-p6"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxv-p6.1">κατατολμᾷ</span>.</p></note>, putting

<p class="c19" id="v.xxv-p8">For it was not all Hebrews that were Israelites,

<p class="c19" id="v.xxv-p10">He is not content with his former deprecation,
but uses it again here also. “I speak as one beside himself, I
more.” I am their superior and their better. And indeed he
possessed clear proofs of his superiority, but nevertheless even so
he terms the thing a folly<note place="end" n="954" id="v.xxv-p10.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxv-p11"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxv-p11.1">παραφροσύνην</span>.</p></note>. And yet if they were false
Apostles, he heeded not to have introduced his own superiority by
way of comparison, but to have destroyed their claim to “be
ministers” at all. Well, he did destroy it, saying, “False
Apostles, deceitful workers, fashioning themselves into Apostles of
Christ,” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. 11.13" id="v.xxv-p11.2" parsed="|2Cor|11|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.11.13">Ver. 13</scripRef>.) but now he doth not proceed
in that way, for his discourse was about to proceed to strict
examination; and no one when an examination is in hand simply
asserts; but having first stated the case in the way of comparison,
he shows it to be negatived by the facts, a very strong negative.
But besides, it is their opinion he gives, not his own assertion,
when he says, “Are they ministers of Christ?” And having
said, “I more,” he proceeds in his comparison, and shows that
not by bare assertions, but by furnishing the proof that facts
supply, he maintains the impress of the Apostleship. And leaving
all his miracles, he begins with his trials; thus saying,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxv-p12">“In labors more abundantly, in stripes above

is there an increase. “In deaths oft.” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. xv. 31" id="v.xxv-p13.1" parsed="|1Cor|15|31|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.15.31">1 Cor. xv. 31</scripRef>.) For, “I die,”
saith he, “daily.” But here, even in reality; ‘for I have

infirmity.’</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxv-p36">“Who is made to stumble, and I burn not?” See,
again, how he places before us the excess of his grief by calling
it “burning.” ‘I am on fire,’ ‘I am in a flame,’ he
says, which is surely greater than any thing he has said. For
those other things, although violent, yet both pass quickly by, and
brought with them that pleasure which is unfading; but this was
what afflicted and straightened him, and pierced his mind through
and through; the suffering such things for each one of the weak,
whosoever he might be. For he did not feel pained for the greater
sort only and despise the lesser, but counted even the abject
amongst his familiar friends. Wherefore also he said, “who is
weak?” whosoever he may be; and as though he were himself the
Church throughout the world, so was he distressed for every
member.</p>

that he no where glorieth of miracles, but of his persecutions and
his trials? For this is meant by “weaknesses.” And he shows

him, and the Gentiles stood against him, and the false brethren
fought with him, and brethren caused him sorrow, through their
weakness and by taking offense:—on every side he found trouble
and disturbance, from friends and from strangers. This is the
especial mark of an Apostle, by these things is the Gospel
woven.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxv-p41">What can be the reason that he here strongly
confirms and gives assurance of [his truth], seeing he did not so
in respect to any of the former things? Because, perhaps, this
was of older date and not so well known<note place="end" n="962" id="v.xxv-p41.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxv-p42"> [The Apostle’s mention of this isolated fact of
his escape at Damascus, at the conclusion of the narrative of his
varied labors and trials, has been variously explained, some
considering it an afterthought, others the opening of a statement
of details intended to be complete but for some reason
interrupted. But it does not seem necessary to view it otherwise
than it appears on its face, as a reminiscence of a peculiar peril
which befel him at the commencement of his Christian career, and by
which he was as it were matriculated in the school of
persecution. The furtive method of escape (in the darkness of
night, <scripRef passage="Acts ix. 25" id="v.xxv-p42.1" parsed="|Acts|9|25|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.9.25">Acts ix. 25</scripRef>.) shows the extreme danger and
helplessness of his position. He could very well put this among
the “weaknesses” in which he ventured to glory (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. 12.5" id="v.xxv-p42.2" parsed="|2Cor|12|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.12.5">xii.
5</scripRef>.), since his
deliverance was effected not by the pomp of a supernatural
interposition as afterwards at Philippi, but by ordinary human
instrumentality, and that certainly not of a very dignified kind.
“The name of Damascus, somewhat irregularly repeated here in that
of its inhabitants, was deeply graven on the Apostle’s memory,
being inseparably associated with the great turning point of his
life, which is the reason why his experience there is mentioned.”
(Waite). If the solemn asservation of the 
<scripRef passage="2 Cor. 11.31" id="v.xxv-p42.3" parsed="|2Cor|11|31|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.11.31">31st verse</scripRef> is to be considered as
referring to what follows, then the explanation given by Chrysostom
in the text is satisfactory. The Apostle’s later trials were
well known to the Corinthians; this one might not have been. Yet
to Paul it was of the profoundest interest because it showed that
where his ministry began, there also began his “weakness.”
Then and there the persecutor became the persecuted. There is no
greater contrast in all human history than that of Paul on his way
to Damascus to bind and deliver to death the Nazarenes, and the
same man fleeing that city between two days to escape the plots of
his former friends and followers. C.]</p></note>; whilst of those other facts, his
care for the churches, and all the rest, they were themselves
cognisant. See then how great the war [against him] was, since on
his account the city was “guarded.” And when I say this of
the war, I say it of the zeal of Paul; for except this had breathed
intensely, it had not kindled the governor to so great madness.
These things are the part of an apostolic soul, to suffer so great
things and yet in nothing to veer about, but to bear nobly whatever
befalls; yet not to go out to meet dangers, nor to rush upon
them. See for instance here, how he was content to evade the
siege, by being “let down through a window in a basket.” For
though he were even desirous “to depart hence;” still
nevertheless he also passionately affected the salvation of men.
And therefore he ofttimes had recourse even to such devices as
these, preserving himself for the Preaching; and he refused not to
use even human contrivances when the occasion called for them; so
sober and watchful was he. For in cases where evils were
inevitable, he needed only grace; but where the trial was of a
measured character, he devises many things of himself even, here
again ascribing the whole to God. And just as a spark of
unquenchable fire, if it fell into the sea, would be merged as many
waves swept over it, yet would again rise shining to the surface;
even so surely the blessed Paul also would now be overwhelmed by
perils, and now again, having dived<note place="end" n="963" id="v.xxv-p42.4"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxv-p43"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxv-p43.1">διαδῦς</span>.</p></note> through them, would come up more
radiant, overcoming by suffering evil.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxv-p44">[3.] For this is the brilliant victory, this
is the Church’s trophy, thus is the Devil overthrown when we
suffer injury. For when we suffer, he is taken captive; and
himself suffers harm, when he would fain inflict it on us. And
this happened in Paul’s case also; and the more he plied him with
perils, the more was he defeated. Nor did he raise up against him
only one kind of trials, but various and diverse. For some
involved labor, others sorrow, others fear, others pain, others
care, others shame, others all these at once; but yet he was
victorious in all. And like as if a single soldier, having the
whole world fighting against him, should move through the mid ranks
of his enemies, and suffer no harm: even so did Paul, showing
himself singly, among barbarians, among Greeks, on every land, on
every sea, abide unconquered. And as a spark, falling upon reeds
and hay, changes into its own nature the things so kindled; so also
did this man setting upon all make things change over unto the
truth; like a winter torrent, sweeping over all things and
overturning every obstacle. And like some champion who wrestles,
runs, and boxes too; or soldier engaged by turns in storming<note place="end" n="964" id="v.xxv-p44.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxv-p45"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxv-p45.1">τειχομαχῶν</span>.</p></note>, fighting on
foot, on shipboard; so did he try by turns every form of fight, and
breathed out fire, and was unapproachable by all; with his single
body taking possession of the world, with his single tongue putting
all to flight. Not with such force did those many trumpets fall
upon the stones of Jericho and throw them down, as did the sound of
this man’s voice both dash to the earth the devil’s
strong-holds and bring over to himself those that were against
him. And when he had collected a multitude of captives, having
armed the same, he made them again his own army, and by their means
conquered. Wonderful was David who laid Goliah low with a single
stone; but if thou wilt examine Paul’s achievements, that is a
child’s exploit, and great 
<pb n="397" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_397.html" id="v.xxv-Page_397" />as is the difference between a shepherd and
a general, so great the difference thou shalt see here. For this
man brought down no Goliath by the hurling of a stone, but by
speaking only he scattered the whole array of the Devil; as a lion
roaring and darting out flame from his tongue, so was he found by
all irresistible; and bounded everywhere by turns continually; he
ran to these, he came to those, he turned about to these, he
bounded away to others, swifter in his attack than the wind;
governing the whole world, as though a single house or a single
ship; rescuing the sinking, steadying the dizzied, cheering the
sailors, sitting at the tiller, keeping an eye to the prow,
tightening the yards, handling an oar, pulling at the mast,
watching the sky; being all things in himself, both sailor, and
pilot, and pilot’s mate<note place="end" n="965" id="v.xxv-p45.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxv-p46"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxv-p46.1">πρωρεὺς</span>.</p></note>, and sail, and ship; and suffering
all things in order to relieve the evils of others. For
consider. He endured shipwreck that he might stay the shipwreck
of the world; “a day and a night he passed in the deep,” that
he might draw it up<note place="end" n="966" id="v.xxv-p46.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxv-p47"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxv-p47.1">ἀ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.xxv-p47.2">νιμήσηται</span>.</p></note> from the deep of error; he was
“in weariness” that he might refresh the weary; he endured
smiting that he might heal those that had been smitten of the
devil; he passed his time in prisons that he might lead forth to
the light those that were sitting in prison and in darkness; he was
“in deaths oft” that he might deliver from grievous deaths;
“five times he received forty stripes save one” that he might
free those that inflicted them from the scourge of the devil; he
was “beaten with rods” that he might bring them under “the
rod and the staff” of Christ; (<scripRef passage="Ps. xxiii. 4" id="v.xxv-p47.3" parsed="|Ps|23|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.23.4">Ps. xxiii. 4</scripRef>.) he “was stoned,”
that he might deliver them from the senseless stones; he “was in
the wilderness<note place="end" n="967" id="v.xxv-p47.4"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxv-p48"> Or, ‘<i>desolateness</i>.’</p></note>,” that he
might take them out of the wilderness; “in journeying,” to stay
their wanderings and open the way that leadeth to heaven; he “was
in perils in the cities,” that he might show the city which is
above; “in hunger and thirst,” to deliver from a more grievous
hunger; “in nakedness,” to clothe their unseemliness with the
robe of Christ; set upon by the mob, to extricate them from the
besetment of fiends; he burned, that he might quench the burning
darts of the devil: “through a window was let down from the
wall,” to send up from below those that lay prostrate upon the
ground. Shall we then talk any more, seeing we do not so much as
know what Paul suffered? shall we make mention any more of goods,
or even of wife, or city, or freedom, when we have seen him ten
thousand times despising even life itself? The martyr dies once
for all: but that blessed saint in his one body and one soul
endured so many perils as were enough to disturb even a soul of
adamant; and what things all the saints together have suffered in
so many bodies, those all he himself endured in one: he entered
into the world as if a race-course, and stripped himself of all,
and so made a noble stand. For he knew the fiends that were
wrestling with him. Wherefore also he shone forth brightly at
once from the beginning, from the very starting-post, and even to
the end he continued the same; yea, rather he even increased the
intensity of his pursuit as he drew nearer to the prize. And what
surely is wonderful is that though suffering and doing such great
things, he knew how to maintain an exceeding modesty. For when he
was driven upon the necessity of relating his own good deeds, he
ran quickly over them all; although he might have filled books
without number, had he wished to unfold in detail<note place="end" n="968" id="v.xxv-p48.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxv-p49"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxv-p49.1">ἐ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.xxv-p49.2">ξαπλῶσαι</span>.</p></note> every thing he mentioned; if he had
specified the Churches he was in care for, if his prisons and his
achievements in them, if of the other things one by one, the
besetments<note place="end" n="969" id="v.xxv-p49.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxv-p50"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxv-p50.1">περιστάσεις</span>.</p></note>, the
assaults. But he would not. Knowing then these things, let us
also learn to be modest and not to glory at any time in wealth or
other worldly things, but in the reproaches we suffer for
Christ’s sake, and in these, only when need compels; for if there
be nothing urging it, let us not mention these even, (lest we be
puffed up,) but our sins only. For so shall we both easily be
released from them and shall have God propitious to us, and shall
attain the life to come; whereunto may we all attain through the
grace and love towards men of our Lord Jesus Christ, with Whom to
the Father, with the Holy Ghost, be glory, might, honor, now and
for ever, and world without end. Amen.</p>

if he had said nothing: but because he is going to pass to

great a reward, but which to the many (though not to careful
examiners) seems to set him off in brighter colors<note place="end" n="971" id="v.xxvi-p5.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxvi-p6"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxvi-p6.1">λαμπρότερον</span>.</p></note>, he says,
“It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory.” For truly
the great grounds of boasting were those which he had recounted,
those of his trials; he has however other things also to tell of,
such as concern the revelations, the unspeakable mysteries. And
wherefore, says he, “It is not expedient for me?” he means,
‘lest it lift me up to pride.’ What sayest thou? For if
thou speak not of them, yet dost thou not know of them? But our
knowing of them ourselves doth not lift us up so much as our
publishing them to others. For it is not the nature of good deeds
that useth to lift a man up, but their being witnessed to, and
known of, by the many. For this cause therefore he saith, “It
is not expedient for me;” and, ‘that I may not implant too
great an idea of me in those who hear.’ For those men indeed,
the false apostles, said even what was not true about themselves;
but this man hides even what is true, and that too although so
great necessity lies upon him, and says, “It is not expedient for
me;” teaching one and all even to superfluity<note place="end" n="972" id="v.xxvi-p6.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxvi-p7"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxvi-p7.1">ἐκ

For this thing<note place="end" n="973" id="v.xxvi-p7.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxvi-p8"> i.e. <i>boasting</i>.</p></note> is attended
with no advantage, but even with harm, except there be some
necessary and useful reason which induceth us thereto. Having
then spoken of his perils, trials, snares, dejections, shipwrecks,
he passeth to another species of boasting, saying,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxvi-p9"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 12.2,3" id="v.xxvi-p9.1" parsed="|2Cor|12|2|12|3" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.12.2-2Cor.12.3">Ver. 2, 3</scripRef>. “I knew a man,
fourteen years ago (whether in the body, I know not; or out of the
body, I know not: God knoweth;) such an one caught up even to the
third heaven. And I know how that he was caught up into Paradise,
(whether in the body, I know not; or out of the body, I know not;)
and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful<note place="end" n="974" id="v.xxvi-p9.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxvi-p10"> Or, ‘<i>possible</i>.’</p></note> for a man to
utter. On behalf of such an one will I glory: but on mine own
behalf I will not glory.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxvi-p11">Great indeed was this revelation. But this
was not the only one: there were many others besides, but he
mentions one out of many. For that there were many, hear what he
says: “Lest I should be exalted overmuch through the exceeding
greatness of the revelations.” ‘And yet,’ a man may say,
‘if he wished to conceal them, he ought not to have given any
intimation<note place="end" n="975" id="v.xxvi-p11.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxvi-p12"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxvi-p12.1">αἴνιγμα</span>.</p></note> whatever or
said any thing of the sort; but if he wished to speak of them, to
speak plainly.’ Wherefore then is it that he neither spoke
plainly nor kept silence? To show by this<note place="end" n="976" id="v.xxvi-p12.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxvi-p13"> Or, ‘<i>in this instance</i>.’</p></note> also that he resorts to the thing
unwillingly. And therefore also he has stated the time,
“fourteen years.” For he does not mention it without an
object, but to show that he who had refrained for so long a time
would not now have spoken out, except the necessity for doing so
had been great. But he would have still kept silence, had he not
seen the brethren perishing. Now if Paul from the very beginning
was such an one as to be counted worthy of such a revelation, when
as yet he had not wrought such good works; consider what he must
have grown to in fourteen years. And observe how even in this
very matter he shows modesty, by his saying some things, but
confessing that of others he is ignorant. For that he was caught
up indeed, he declared, but whether “in the body” or “out of
the body” he says he does not know. And yet it would have been
quite enough, if he had told of his being caught up and had been
silent [about the other]; but as it is, in his modesty he adds this
also. What then? Was it the mind that was caught up and the
soul, whilst the body remained dead? or was the <pb n="399" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_399.html" id="v.xxvi-Page_399" />body caught up? It is impossible to
tell. For if Paul who was caught up and whom things unspeakable,
so many and so great, had befallen was in ignorance, much more
we. For, indeed, that he was in Paradise he knew, and that he was
in the third heaven he was not ignorant, but the manner he knew not
clearly. And see from yet another consideration how free he is
from pride. For in his narrative about “the city of the
Damascenes” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. xi. 32" id="v.xxvi-p13.1" parsed="|2Cor|11|32|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.11.32">2 Cor. xi.
32</scripRef>.) he confirms what he
says, but here not; for it was not his aim to establish this fact
strongly, but to mention and intimate it only. Wherefore also he
goes on to say, “Of such an one will I glory;” not meaning that
he who was caught up was some other person, but he so frames his
language in the best manner he possibly could, so as at once to
mention the fact, and to avoid speaking of himself openly. For
what sequence would there be in bringing some one else forward,
when discoursing about himself? Wherefore then did he so put
it? It was not all one to say, ‘I was caught up,’ and, “I
knew one that was caught up;” and ‘I will glory of myself,’
and, “I will glory of such an one.” Now if any should say,
‘And how is it possible to be caught up without a body?’ I will
ask him, ‘How is it possible to be caught up with a body?’ for
this is even more inexplicable than the other, if you examine by
reasonings and do not give place to faith.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxvi-p14">[2.] But wherefore was he also caught up? As I
think, that he might not seem to be inferior to the rest of the
Apostles. For since they had companied with Christ, but Paul had
not: He therefore caught up unto glory him also. “Into
Paradise.” For great was the name of this place, and it was
everywhere celebrated. Wherefore also Christ said, “To-day thou
shalt be with Me in Paradise.” (<scripRef passage="Luke xxiii. 43" id="v.xxvi-p14.1" parsed="|Luke|23|43|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.23.43">Luke xxiii. 43</scripRef>.)</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxvi-p15">“On behalf of such an one will I glory?”
wherefore? For if another were caught up, wherefore dost thou
glory? Whence it is evident that he said these things of
himself. And if he added, “but of myself I will not glory,”
he says nothing else than this, that, ‘when there is no
necessity, I will say nothing of that kind fruitlessly and at
random;’ or else he is again throwing obscurity over<note place="end" n="977" id="v.xxvi-p15.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxvi-p16"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxvi-p16.1">συσκιάζων</span>.</p></note> what he had
said, as best he might. For that the whole discourse was about
himself, what follows also clearly shows; for he went on to
say,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxvi-p17"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 12.6" id="v.xxvi-p17.1" parsed="|2Cor|12|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.12.6">Ver. 6</scripRef>.
“But if I should even desire to glory, I shall not be foolish;
for I shall speak the truth.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxvi-p18">How then saidst thou before, “Would that ye could
bear with me a little in my foolishness;” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. 11.1" id="v.xxvi-p18.1" parsed="|2Cor|11|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.11.1">Chap. xi.

speak, I speak not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly;”
(<scripRef passage="2 Cor. 11.17" id="v.xxvi-p18.2" parsed="|2Cor|11|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.11.17">Chap. xi. 17</scripRef>.) but here, “Though I should
even desire to glory, I shall not be foolish?” Not in regard of
glorying, but of lying; for if glorying be foolishness, how much
more lying?</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxvi-p19">It is then with regard to this that he says, “I
shall not be foolish.” Wherefore also he added,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxvi-p20">“For I shall speak the truth; but I forbear,
lest any man should account of me above that which he seeth<note place="end" n="978" id="v.xxvi-p20.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxvi-p21"> Rec. text, ‘<i>seeth me</i>.’</p></note>, or that he
heareth from me.” Here you have the acknowledged reason; for
they even deemed them to be gods, on account of the greatness of
their miracles. As then in the case of the elements, God hath
done both things, creating them at once weak and glorious; the one,
to proclaim His own power; the other, to prevent the error of
mankind<note place="end" n="979" id="v.xxvi-p21.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxvi-p22"> i.e., in worshiping them.</p></note>: so truly
here also were they both wonderful and weak, so that by the facts
themselves were the unbelievers instructed. For if whilst
continuing to be wonderful only and giving no proof of weakness,
they had by words tried to draw away the many from conceiving of
them more than the truth; not only would they have nothing
succeeded, but they would even have brought about the contrary.
For those dissuasions in words would have seemed rather to spring
of lowliness of mind, and would have caused them to be the more
admired. Therefore in act and by deeds was their weakness
disclosed. And one may see this exemplified in the men who lived
under the old dispensation. For Elias was wonderful, but on one

passion. Now such things befel them, because God stood aloof and
permitted their human nature to stand confessed. For if because
he led them out they said, ‘Where is Moses?’ what would they
not have said, if he had also led them in? Wherefore also [Paul]
himself says, “I forbear, lest any should account of me.” He
said not, ‘say of me,’ but, “lest any should even account of
me” beyond my desert.’ Whence it is evident from this also
that the whole discourse relates to himself. Wherefore even when
he began, he said, “It is not expedient for me doubtless to
glory,” which he would not have said, had he been going to speak
the things which he said of another man. For wherefore is it
“not expedient to glory” about another? But it was himself
that was counted worthy of these things; and therefore it is that
he goes on to say,</p>

who is there would say this? What then is the meaning of what is
said? When we have explained what is meant at all by the
“thorn,” and who is this “messenger of Satan,” then will we
declare this also. There are some then who have said that he
means a kind of pain in the head which was inflicted of the devil;
but God forbid!  For the body of Paul never could have been given
over to the hands of the devil, seeing that the devil himself
submitted to the same Paul at his mere bidding; and he set him laws
and bounds, when he delivered over the fornicator for the
destruction of the flesh, and he dared not to transgress them.
What then is the meaning of what is said? An adversary is called,
in the Hebrew, Satan; and in the third Book of Kings the Scripture
has so termed such as were adversaries; and speaking of Solomon,
says, ‘In his days there was no Satan,’ that is, no adversary,
enemy, or opponent. (<scripRef passage="1 Kings v. 4" id="v.xxvi-p27.2" parsed="|1Kgs|5|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Kgs.5.4">1 Kings v. 4</scripRef>.) What he says then is
this: God would not permit the Preaching to progress, in order to
check our high thoughts; but permitted the adversaries to set upon
us. For this indeed was enough to pluck down his high thoughts;
not so that, pains in the head. And so by the “messenger of
Satan,” he means Alexander the coppersmith, the party of
Hymenæus and Philetus, all the adversaries of the word; those who
contended with and fought against him, those that cast him into a
prison, those that beat him, that led him away to death<note place="end" n="983" id="v.xxvi-p27.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxvi-p28"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxvi-p28.1">ἁ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.xxvi-p28.2">πάγντας</span>.</p></note>; for they
did Satan’s business. As then he calls those Jews children of
the devil, who were imitating his deeds, so also he calls a
“messenger of Satan” every one that opposeth. He says
therefore, “There was given to me a thorn to buffet me;” not as
if God putteth arms into such men’s hands, God forbid! not that
He doth chastise or punish, but for the time alloweth and
permitteth them.<note place="end" n="984" id="v.xxvi-p28.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxvi-p29"> [Chrysostom’s view of this peculiar trial
of the Apostle, although held by most of the Greek fathers and by
some eminent scholars of later ages (Erasmus, Calvin, Fritzsche,
Reiche, etc.) does not seem satisfactory. There was nothing
peculiar to Paul in the trials and temptations incident to the
Apostolic office, for they were shared by all his companions, nor
do they seem to be properly expressed by “a stake <i>in the
flesh</i>,” or as some prefer to render “for the flesh,”
which naturally suggests that the affliction was a bodily ailment,
something that caused pain and made the discharge of his duties
burdensome. Bp. Lightfoot (Com. on Galatians, pp. 186, 187)
suggests that the circumstances imply that the malady was acute and
severe; that it was in some way humiliating as intended to check
spiritual pride; that as a grievous hindrance to the Gospel it was
a trial to his constancy and resolution; that it was of such a
nature that it could not be concealed from others; and that it was
continuous or recurrent. All attempts to define it more
closely—Chrysostom on this page mentions one, “pains in the
head”—fail as being purely conjectural. But the fullest
knowledge on the subject however it might gratify curiosity could
add nothing to the instructiveness of the case as it stands. That
the most honored of all philanthropists, the chiefest of the
twelve, the most distinguished of Christ’s followers should
require to be buffeted with such a chronic bodily ailment; that the
most earnest prayers could not succeed in securing its removal; and
yet that grace was bestowed on him to bear it, and bestowed in such
measure that he could even rejoice in what was painful and glory in
infirmities, is a lesson of Christian experience that has been full
of comfort and edification in all ages of the church. To this we
owe the noble Christian paradox which to myriads of burdened souls
has been a well-spring of comfort and peace, <span class="c18" id="v.xxvi-p29.1">When

<p class="c19" id="v.xxvi-p31">That is, oftentimes. This also is a mark of great

“And He said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee; for my
power is made perfect in weakness.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxvi-p33">That is to say, ‘It is sufficient for thee that
thou raisest the dead, that thou curest the blind, that thou
cleansest lepers, that thou workest those other miracles; seek not
also exemption from danger and fear and to preach without
annoyances. But art thou pained and dejected lest it should seem
to be owing to My weakness, that there are many who plot against
and beat thee and harass and scourge thee? Why this very thing
doth show My power. “For My power,” He saith, “is made
perfect in weakness,” when being persecuted ye overcome your
persecutors; when being harassed ye get the better of them that
harass you; when being put in bonds ye convert them that put you in
bonds. Seek not then more than is needed.’ Seest thou how he
himself assigns one reason, and God another? For he himself says,
“Lest I should be exalted overmuch, there was given to me a
thorn;” but he says that God said He permitted it in order to
show His power. ‘Thou seekest therefore a thing which is not
only not needed, but which also obscureth the glory of My
power.’ For by the words, “is sufficient for thee,” He
would signify this, that nothing else need be added, but the whole
was complete. So that from this also it is plain that he does not
intend pains in the head; for in truth they did not preach when
they were sick, for they could not preach when ill; but that
harassed and persecuted, they overcame all. ‘After having heard
this then,’ he says,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxvi-p34">“Most gladly therefore will I glory in my
weaknesses.” For that they may not sink down, when those false
Apostles are glorying over their contrary lot<note place="end" n="985" id="v.xxvi-p34.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxvi-p35"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxvi-p35.1">ἐπὶ

persecution, he shows that he shineth all the brighter for
<pb n="401" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_401.html" id="v.xxvi-Page_401" />this, and that thus the power
of God shines forth the rather, and what happens is just matter for
glorying. Wherefore he says, “Most gladly therefore will I
glory.” ‘Not as therefore sorrowing did I speak of the things
which I enumerated, or of that which I have just now said, “there
was given to me a thorn;” but as priding myself upon them and
drawing to myself greater power.’ Wherefore also he adds,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxvi-p36">“That the strength of Christ may rest upon
me.” Here he hints at another thing also, namely, that in
proportion as the trials waxed in intensity, in the same proportion
the grace was increased and continued.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxvi-p39">Seest thou how he has now revealed it in the

ailment, but of “injuries, persecutions, distresses.” Seest
thou a single-minded soul? He longs to be delivered from those
dangers; but when he heard God’s answer that this befitteth not,
he was not only not sorry that he was disappointed of his prayer,
but was even glad. Wherefore he said, “I take pleasure,” ‘I
rejoice, I long, to be injured, persecuted, distressed for
Christ’s sake.’ And he said these things both to check those,
and to raise the spirits of these that they might not be ashamed at
Paul’s sufferings. For that ground<note place="end" n="988" id="v.xxvi-p40.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxvi-p41"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxvi-p41.1">ἡ  ὑπόθεσις</span>.</p></note> was enough to make them shine
brighter than all men. Then he mentions another reason
also.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxvi-p42">“For when I am weak, then am I strong.” ‘Why
marvellest thou that the power of God is then conspicuous? I too
am strong “then;”’ for then most of all did grace come upon
him. “For as His sufferings abound, so doth our consolation
abound also.” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. 1.5" id="v.xxvi-p42.1" parsed="|2Cor|1|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.1.5">Chap. i. 5</scripRef>.)</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxvi-p43">[4.] Where affliction is, there is also
consolation; where consolation, there is grace also. For instance
when he was thrown into the prison, then it was he wrought those
marvellous things; when he was shipwrecked and cast away upon that
barbarous country, then more than ever was he glorified. When he
went bound into the judgment-hall, then he overcame even the
judge. And so it was too in the Old Testament; by<note place="end" n="989" id="v.xxvi-p43.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxvi-p44"> Or, amidst.</p></note> their trials
the righteous flourished. So it was with the three children, so
with Daniel, with Moses, and Joseph; thence did they all shine and
were counted worthy of great crowns. For then the soul also is
purified, when it is afflicted for God’s sake: it then enjoys
greater assistance as needing more help and worthy of more grace.
And truly, before the reward which is proposed to it by God, it
reaps a rich harvest of good things by becoming philosophic. For
affliction rends pride away and prunes out all listlessness and
exerciseth<note place="end" n="990" id="v.xxvi-p44.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxvi-p45"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxvi-p45.1">ἁ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.xxvi-p45.2">λείφει</span>.</p></note> unto
patience: it revealeth the meanness of human things and leads
unto much philosophy. For all the passions give way before it,
envy, emulation, lust, rule,<note place="end" n="991" id="v.xxvi-p45.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxvi-p46"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxvi-p46.1">δυναστεία</span>.</p></note> desire of riches, of beauty<note place="end" n="992" id="v.xxvi-p46.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxvi-p47"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxvi-p47.1">σωμάτων</span>.</p></note>,
boastfulness, pride, anger; and the whole remaining swarm of these
distempers. And if thou desirest to see this in actual working, I
shall be able to show thee both a single individual and a whole
people, as well under affliction as at ease; and so to teach thee
how great advantage cometh of the one, and how great listlessness
from the other.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxvi-p48">For the people of the Hebrews, when they were
vexed and persecuted, groaned and besought God, and drew down upon
themselves great influences<note place="end" n="993" id="v.xxvi-p48.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxvi-p49"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxvi-p49.1">ῥ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.xxvi-p49.2">οπήν</span>.</p></note> from above: but when they waxed
fat, they kicked. The Ninevities again, when they were in the
enjoyment of security, so exasperated God that He threatened to
pluck up the entire city from its foundations: but after they had
been humbled by that preaching, they displayed all virtue<note place="end" n="994" id="v.xxvi-p49.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxvi-p50"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxvi-p50.1">φιλοσοφίαν</span>.</p></note>. But if
thou wouldest see also a single individual, consider Solomon. For
he, when deliberating with anxiety and trouble concerning the
government of that nation, was vouchsafed that vision: but when
he was in the enjoyment of luxury, he slid into the very pit of
iniquity. And what did his father? When was he admirable and
passing belief? Was it not when he was in trials? And Absalom,
was he not sober-minded, whilst still an exile; but after his
return, became both tyrannical and a parricide? And what did
Job? He indeed shone even in prosperity, but showed yet brighter
after his affliction. And why must one speak of the old and
ancient things? for if one do but examine our own state at present,
he will see how great is the advantage of affliction. For now
indeed that we are in the enjoyment of peace, we are become supine,
and lax<note place="end" n="995" id="v.xxvi-p50.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxvi-p51"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxvi-p51.1">διερρύημεν</span>.</p></note> and have
filled the Church with countless evils; but when we were
persecuted, we were more sober-minded, and kinder, and more
earnest, and more ready as to these assemblies and as to hearing.
For what fire is to gold, that is affliction unto souls; wiping
away filth, rendering men clean, making them bright and shining.
It leadeth unto the kingdom, that unto hell. And therefore the
one way is broad, the other narrow. Wherefore also, He
Himself <pb n="402" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_402.html" id="v.xxvi-Page_402" />said, “In the
world ye shall have tribulation,” (<scripRef passage="John xvi. 33" id="v.xxvi-p51.2" parsed="|John|16|33|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.16.33">John xvi. 33</scripRef>.) as though he were
leaving some great good behind unto us. If then thou art a
disciple, travel thou the straight and narrow way, and be not
disgusted nor discouraged.<note place="end" n="996" id="v.xxvi-p51.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxvi-p52"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxvi-p52.1">ἀ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.xxvi-p52.2">ποδυσπέτει</span>.</p></note>  For even if thou be not afflicted
in that way; thou must inevitably be afflicted on other grounds, of
no advantage to thee. For the envious man also, and the lover of
money, and he that burneth for an harlot, and the vainglorious, and
each one of the rest that follow whatsoever is evil, endureth many
disheartenings and afflictions, and is not less afflicted than they
who mourn. And if he doth not weep nor mourn, it is for shame and
insensibility: since if thou shouldest look into his soul, thou
wilt see it filled with countless waves. Since then whether we
follow this way of life or that, we must needs be afflicted: 
wherefore choose we not this way which along with affliction
bringeth crowns innumerable? For thus hath God led all the saints
through affliction and distress, at once doing them service, and
securing the rest of men against entertaining a higher opinion of
them than they deserve. For thus it was that idolatries gained
ground at first; men being held in admiration beyond their
desert. Thus the Roman senate decreed Alexander<note place="end" n="997" id="v.xxvi-p52.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxvi-p53"> That Alexander the Great had at any rate a temple
dedicated to him, is mentioned by Lampridius.</p></note> to be the thirteenth God, for it
possessed the privilege of electing and enrolling Gods. For
instance, when all about Christ had been reported, the ruler of the
nation<note place="end" n="998" id="v.xxvi-p53.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxvi-p54"> See Tertull. <i>Apol</i>. Oxf. Trans. p. 13.
and note. Justin Martyr mentions Pilate’s Report. Eusebius,
<i>Hist. Eccles</i>. ii. 2. gives the same account as from
Tertullian, which Chrysostom here gives.</p></note> sent to
inquire, whether they would be pleased to elect Him also a God.
They however refused their consent, being angry and indignant that
previous to their vote and decree, the Power of the Crucified
flashing abroad had won over the whole world to its own worship.
But thus it was ordered even against their will that the Divinity
of Christ was not proclaimed by man’s decree, nor was He counted
one of the many that were by them elected. For they counted even
boxers to be Gods, and the favorite of Hadrian; after whom the city
Antinous is named. For since death testifies against their moral
nature, the devil invented another way, that of the soul’s
immortality; and mingling therewith that excessive flattery, he
seduced many into impiety. And observe what wicked artifice.
When we advance that doctrine for a good purpose, he overthrows our
words; but when he himself is desirous of framing an argument for
mischief, he is very zealous in setting it up. And if any one
ask, ‘How is Alexander a God? Is he not dead? and miserably
too?’ ‘Yes, but the soul is immortal?’ he replies. Now
thou arguest and philosophizest for immortality, to detach men from
the God Who is over all: but when we declare that this is God’s
greatest gift, thou persuadest thy dupes that men are low and
grovelling, and in no better case than the brutes. And if we say,
‘the Crucified lives,’ laughter follows immediately: although
the whole world proclaims it, both in old time and now; in old time
by miracles, now by converts; for truly these successes are not
those of a dead man: but if one say, ‘Alexander lives,’ thou
believest, although thou hast no miracle to allege.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxvi-p55">[5.] ‘Yes,’ one replies; ‘I have; for when
he lived he wrought many and great achievements; for he subdued
both nations and cities, and in many wars and battles he conquered,
and erected trophies.’</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxvi-p56">If then I shall show [somewhat] which he when
alive never dreamed of, neither he, nor any other man that ever
lived, what other proof of the resurrection wilt thou require? 
For that whilst alive one should win battles and victories, being a
king and having armies at his disposal, is nothing marvelous, no,
nor startling or novel; but that after a Cross and Tomb one should
perform such great things throughout every land and sea, this it is
which is most especially replete with such amazement, and proclaims
His divine and unutterable Power. And Alexander indeed after his
decease never restored again his kingdom which had been rent in
pieces and quite abolished: indeed how was it likely he, dead,
should do so? but Christ then most of all set up His after He was
dead. And why speak I of Christ? seeing that He granted to His
disciples also, after their deaths, to shine? For, tell me, where
is the tomb of Alexander? show it me and tell me the day on which
he died. But of the servants of Christ the very tombs are
glorious, seeing they have taken possession of the most loyal city;
and their days are well known, making festivals for the world.
And his tomb even his own people know not, but this man’s<note place="end" n="999" id="v.xxvi-p56.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxvi-p57"> St. Paul’s as Mr. Field supposes.</p></note> the very
barbarians know. And the tombs of the servants of the Crucified
are more splendid than the palaces of kings; not for the size and
beauty of the buildings, (yet even in this they surpass them,) but,
what is far more, in the zeal of those who frequent them. For he
that wears the purple himself goes to embrace those tombs, and,
laying aside his pride, stands begging the saints<note place="end" n="1000" id="v.xxvi-p57.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxvi-p58"> This passage should have been mentioned in

advocates with God, and he that hath the diadem implores the
tent-maker and the fisherman, though dead, to be his patrons.
Wilt thou dare then, tell me, to 
<pb n="403" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_403.html" id="v.xxvi-Page_403" />call the Lord of these dead; whose servants
even after their decease are the patrons of the kings of the
world? And this one may see take place not in Rome only, but in
Constantinople also. For there also Constantine the Great, his
son considered he should be honoring with great honor, if he buried
him in the porch of the fisherman; and what porters are to kings in
their palaces, that kings are at the tomb to fisherman. And these
indeed as lords of the place occupy the inside, whilst the others
as though but sojourners and neighbors were glad to have the gate
of the porch assigned them; showing by what is done in this world,
even to the unbelievers, that in the Resurrection the fisherman
will be yet more their superiors. For if here it is so in the
burial [of each], much more will it in the resurrection. And
their rank is interchanged; kings assume that of servants and
ministers, and subjects the dignity of kings, yea rather a brighter
still. And that this is no piece of flattery, the truth itself
demonstrates; for by those these have become more illustrious.
For far greater reverence is paid to these tombs than to the other
royal sepulchres; for there indeed is profound solitude, whilst
here there is an immense concourse. But if thou wilt compare
these tombs with the royal palaces, here again the palm remains
with them. For there indeed there are many who keep off, but here
many who invite and draw to them rich, poor, men, women, bond,
free; there, is much fear; here, pleasure unutterable. ‘But,’
saith one, ‘it is a sweet sight to look on a king covered with
gold and crowned, and standing by his side, generals, commanders,
captains of horse and foot, lieutenants.’ Well, but this of
ours is so much grander and more awful that that must be judged,
compared with it, to be stage scenery<note place="end" n="1001" id="v.xxvi-p58.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxvi-p59"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxvi-p59.1">σκηνὴν</span>.</p></note> and child’s play. For the
instant thou hast stepped across the threshhold, at once the place
sends up thy thoughts to heaven, to the King above, to the army of
the Angels, to the lofty throne, to the unapproachable glory. And
here indeed He hath put in the ruler’s power, of his subjects to
loose one, and bind another; but the bones of the saints possess no
such pitiful and mean authority, but that which is far greater.
For they summon demons and put them to the torture, and loose from
those bitterest of all bonds, them that are bound. What is more
fearful than this tribunal? Though no one is seen, though no one
piles the sides of the demon, yet are there cries, and tearings<note place="end" n="1002" id="v.xxvi-p59.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxvi-p60"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxvi-p60.1">σπαρυγμοὶ</span>.</p></note>, lashes,
tortures, burning tongues, because the demon cannot endure that
marvellous power. And they that once wore bodies, are victorious
over bodiless powers; [their] dust and bones and ashes rack those

that demons are scourged, men chastened and delivered. Seest thou
the power of saints, even dead? seest thou the weakness of sinners,

over such; and pursue virtue with all thy might. For if the case
be thus here, consider what it will be in the world to come. And

<p class="c27" id="v.xxvii-p3">I am become foolish in glorying; ye compelled me: 
for I ought to have been commended of you.</p>

<p class="c24" id="v.xxvii-p4"><span class="c18" id="v.xxvii-p4.1">Having</span> fully completed what
he had to say about his own praises, he did not stay at this; but
again excuses himself and asks pardon for what he said, declaring
that his doing so was of necessity and not of choice. Still
nevertheless, although there was necessity, he calls himself “a
fool.” And when he began indeed, he said, “As foolish receive
me,” and “as in foolishness;” but now, leaving out the
‘as,’ he calls himself “foolish.” For after he had
established the point he wished by saying what he did, he
afterwards boldly and unsparingly grapples with all failing of the
sort, teaching all persons that none should ever praise himself
where there is no necessity, seeing that even where a reason for it
existed, Paul termed himself a fool [for 
<pb n="404" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_404.html" id="v.xxvii-Page_404" />so doing]. Then he turns the blame also of his
so speaking not upon the false Apostles, but wholly upon the
disciples. For “ye,” he saith, “compelled me.” ‘For
if they gloried, but were not by doing so leading you astray nor
causing your destruction, I should not have been thus led on to
descend unto this discussion: but because they were corrupting
the whole Church, with a view to your advantage I was compelled to
become foolish.’ And he did not say, ‘For I feared lest if
they obtained the highest estimation with you, they should sow
their doctrines,’ yet this indeed he set down above when he said,
“I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent deceived Eve, so your
minds should be corrupted.” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. 11.3" id="v.xxvii-p4.2" parsed="|2Cor|11|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.11.3">Chap. xi. 3</scripRef>.) Here however he does not
so express himself, but in a more commanding manner and with more
authority, having gained boldness from what he had said, “For I
ought to have been commended of you.” Then he also assigns the
reason; and again he mentions not his revelations nor his miracles
only, but his temptations also.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxvii-p5">“For in nothing was I behind the chiefest
Apostles.” See how he here too again speaks out with greater
authoritativeness. For, before indeed he said, “I reckon I am
not a whit behind,” but here, after those proofs, he now boldly
speaks out asserting the fact, as I said, thus absolutely. Not
that even thus he departs from the mean, nor from his proper
character. For as though he had uttered something great and
exceeding his deserts, in that he numbered himself with the
Apostles, he thus again speaks modestly, and adds,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxvii-p6"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 12.12" id="v.xxvii-p6.1" parsed="|2Cor|12|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.12.12">Ver. 12</scripRef>. “Although I be nothing,
the signs of an Apostle were wrought among you.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxvii-p7">‘Look not thou at this,’ he says, ‘whether I
be mean and little, but whether thou hast not enjoyed those things
which from an Apostle it was meet thou shouldest enjoy.’ Yet he
did not say ‘mean,’ but what was lower, “nothing.” For
where is the good of being great, and of use to nobody? even as
there is no advantage in a skilful physician if he heals none of
those that be sick. ‘Do not then,’ he says, ‘scrutinize
this that I am nothing, but consider that, that wherein ye ought to
have been benefitted, I have failed in nothing, but have given
proof of mine Apostleship. There ought then to have been no need
for me to say aught.’ Now he thus spoke, not as wanting to be
commended, (for how should he, he who counted heaven itself to be a
small thing in comparison with his longing after Christ?) but as
desiring their salvation. Then lest they should say, ‘And what
is it to us, even though thou wast not a whit behind the very
chiefest Apostles?’ he therefore added,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxvii-p8">“The signs of an Apostle were wrought among you in
all patience, and by signs and wonders.” Amazing! what a sea of
good works hath he traversed in a few words!  And observe what it
is he puts first, “patience.” For this is the note of an
Apostle, bearing all things nobly. This then he expressed shortly
by a single word; but upon the miracles, which were not of his own
achieving, he employs more. For consider how many prisons, how
many stripes, how many dangers, how many conspiracies, how many
sleet-showers of temptations, how many civil, how many foreign
wars, how many pains, how many attacks he has implied here in that
word, “patience!” And by “signs” again, how many dead
raised, how many blind healed, how many lepers cleansed, how many
devils cast out!  Hearing these things, let us learn if we happen
upon a necessity for such recitals to cut our good deeds short, as
he too did.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxvii-p9">[2.] Then lest any should say, Well! if thou be
both great, and have wrought many things, still thou hast not
wrought such great things, as the Apostles have in the other
Churches, he added,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxvii-p10"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 12.13" id="v.xxvii-p10.1" parsed="|2Cor|12|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.12.13">Ver. 13</scripRef>. “For what is there
wherein ye were made inferior to the rest of the Churches?”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxvii-p11">‘Ye were partakers,’ he says, ‘of no
less grace than the others.’ But perhaps some one will say,
‘What can be the reason that he turns the discourse upon the
Apostles, abandoning the contest against the false Apostles?’
Because he is desirous to erect their spirits yet further, and to
show that he is not only superior to them, but not even inferior to
the great Apostles. Therefore, surely, when he is speaking of
those he says, “I am more;” but when he compares himself with
the Apostles, he considers it a great thing<note place="end" n="1004" id="v.xxvii-p11.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxvii-p12"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxvii-p12.1">ἀ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.xxvii-p12.2">γαπητὸν</span>.</p></note> not to be “behind,” although
he labored more than they. And thence he shows that they insult
the Apostles, in holding him who is their equal second to these
men.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxvii-p13">“Except it be that I myself was not a burden to
you?” Again he has pronounced their rebuke with great
severity. And what follows is of yet more odious import.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxvii-p14">“Forgive me this wrong.” Still, nevertheless,
this severity contains both words of love and a commendation of
themselves; if, that is, they consider it a wrong done to them,
that the Apostle did not consent to receive aught from them, nor
relied on them enough to be supported by them. ‘If,’ says he,
‘ye blame me for this:’ he did not say, ‘Ye blame me
wrongly,’ but with great sweetness, ‘I ask your pardon, forgive
me this fault.’ And observe his prudence. For because the
mooting this continually tended to bring disgrace upon them, he
continually softens it down; saying above, for 
<pb n="405" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_405.html" id="v.xxvii-Page_405" />instance, “As the truth of Christ is in me,
this boasting shall not be stopped in me;” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. 11.10" id="v.xxvii-p14.1" parsed="|2Cor|11|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.11.10">Chap. xi.
10</scripRef>.) then again,
“Because I love you not? God knoweth..…But that I may cut off
occasion from them that desire occasion, and that wherein they
glory, they may be found even as we.” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. 11.11,12" id="v.xxvii-p14.2" parsed="|2Cor|11|11|11|12" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.11.11-2Cor.11.12">Chap.
xi. 11, 12</scripRef>.) And in the
former Epistle “What is my reward then?” Verily, “that when
I preach the Gospel, I may make the Gospel without charge.”
(<scripRef passage="1 Cor. ix. 18" id="v.xxvii-p14.3" parsed="|1Cor|9|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.9.18">1 Cor. ix. 18</scripRef>.) And here; “Forgive me
this wrong.” For every where he avoids showing that it is on
account of their weakness he taketh not [from them]; and here not
to wound them. And therefore here he thus expresses himself;
‘If ye think this to be an offense, I ask forgiveness.’ Now
he spoke thus, at once to wound and to heal. For do not say this,
I pray thee; ‘If thou meanest to wound, why excuse it? but if
thou excusest it, why wound?’ For this is wisdom’s part, at
once to lance, and to bind up the sore. Then that he may not
seem, as he also said before, to be continually harping upon this
for the sake of receiving from them, he remedies this [suspicion],
even in his former Epistle, saying, “But I write not these things
that it may be so done in my case; for it were good for me rather
to die, than that any man should make my glorying void;” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. ix. 15" id="v.xxvii-p14.4" parsed="|1Cor|9|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.9.15">1 Cor. ix. 15</scripRef>.) but here with more sweetness
and gentleness. How, and in what manner?</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxvii-p15"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 12.14" id="v.xxvii-p15.1" parsed="|2Cor|12|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.12.14">Ver. 14</scripRef>. “Behold this is the third
time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be a burden to you;
for I seek not yours, but you: for the children ought not to lay
up for the parents, but the parents for the children.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxvii-p16">What he says is this; ‘It is not because I do not
receive of you that I do not come to you; nay, I have already come
twice; and I am prepared to come this third time, “and I will not
be a burden to you.”’ And the reason is a noble one. For he
did not say, ‘because ye are mean,’ ‘because ye are hurt at
it,’ ‘because, ye are weak:’ but what? “For I seek not
yours, but you.” ‘I seek greater things; souls instead of
goods; instead of gold, salvation.’ Then because there still
hung about the matter some suspicion, as if he were displeased at
them; he therefore even states an argument. For since it was
likely they would say, ‘Can you not have both us and ours?’ he
adds with much grace this excuse for them, saying, “For the
children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for
the children;” instead of teachers and disciples, employing the
term parents and children, and showing that he does as a matter of
duty what was not of duty. For Christ did not so command, but he
says this to spare them; and therefore he adds also something
further. For he did not only say that “the children ought not
to lay up,” but also that the parents ought to. Therefore since
it is meet to give,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxvii-p17"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 12.15" id="v.xxvii-p17.1" parsed="|2Cor|12|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.12.15">Ver. 15</scripRef>. “I will most gladly spend
and be spent for your souls.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxvii-p18">‘For the law of nature indeed has commanded
the parents to lay up for the children; but I do not do this only,
but I give myself also besides.’ And this lavishness of his,
the not only not receiving, but giving also besides, is not in
common sort but accompanied with great liberality, and out of his
own want; for the words, “I will be spent,” are of one who
would imply this. ‘For should it be necessary to spend my very
flesh, I will not spare it for your salvation.’ And that which
follows contains at once accusation and love, “though the more
abundantly I love you, the less I be loved.” ‘And I do
this,’ he says, ‘for the sake of those who are beloved by me,
yet love me not equally.’ Observe then, now, how many steps
there are in this matter<note place="end" n="1005" id="v.xxvii-p18.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxvii-p19"> Or, his conduct.</p></note>. He had a right to receive, but
he did not receive; here is good work the first: and this, though
in want; [good work] the second; and though preaching to them, the
third; he gives besides, the fourth; and not merely gives, but
lavishly<note place="end" n="1006" id="v.xxvii-p19.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxvii-p20"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxvii-p20.1">μετὰ ἐπιτάσεως</span>.</p></note> too, the
fifth; not money only, but himself, the sixth; for those who loved
him not greatly, the seventh; and for those whom he greatly loved,
the eighth.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxvii-p21">[3.] Let us then also emulate this man!  For it
is a serious charge, the not loving even; but becomes more serious,
when although one is loved he loveth not. For if he that loveth
one that loveth him be no better than the publicans; (<scripRef passage="Matt. v. 46" id="v.xxvii-p21.1" parsed="|Matt|5|46|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.46">Matt. v. 46</scripRef>.) he that doth not so
much as this ranks with the beasts; yea rather, is even below
them. What sayest thou, O man? Lovest thou not him that loveth
thee? What then dost thou live for? Wherein wilt thou be of use
hereafter<note place="end" n="1007" id="v.xxvii-p21.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxvii-p22"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxvii-p22.1">λοιπόν</span>.</p></note>? in what
sort of matters? in public? in private? By no means; for nothing
is more useless than a man that knows not to love. This law even
robbers have oftentimes respected, and murderers, and
housebreakers; and having only taken salt with one, have been made
his friends<note place="end" n="1008" id="v.xxvii-p22.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxvii-p23"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxvii-p23.1">μετετάξαντο</span>.</p></note>, letting
the board change their disposition, and thou that sharest not salt
only, but words and deeds, and comings in and goings out, with him,
dost thou not love? Nay: those that live impurely lavish even
whole estates on their strumpets; and thou who hast a worthy love,
art thou so cold, and weak, and unmanly, as not to be willing to
love, even when it costs thee nothing? ‘And who,’ one asks,
‘would be so vile, who such a wild 
<pb n="406" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_406.html" id="v.xxvii-Page_406" />beast, as to turn away from and to hate him
that loves him?’ Thou dost well indeed to disbelieve it,
because of the unnaturalness of the thing; but if I shall show that
there are many such persons, how shall we then bear the shame? 
For when thou speakest ill of him whom thou lovest, when thou
hearest another speak ill of him and thou defendest him not, when
thou grudgest that he should be well accounted of, what sort of
affection is this? And yet it is not sufficient proof of love,
not grudging, nor yet again not being at enmity or war with, but
only supporting<note place="end" n="1009" id="v.xxvii-p23.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxvii-p24"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxvii-p24.1">συγκροτεῖν</span>.</p></note> and
advancing him that loves thee: but when a man does and says
everything to pull down his neighbor even, what can be more
wretched than such a spirit? Yesterday and the day before his
friend, thou didst both converse and eat with him: then because
all at once thou sawest thine own member highly thought of, casting
off the mask of friendship, thou didst put on that of enmity, or
rather of madness. For glaring madness it is, to be annoyed at
the goodness of neighbors; for this is the act of mad and rabid
dogs. For like them, these also fly at all men’s faces,
exasperated with envy. Better to have a serpent twining about
one’s entrails than envy crawling in us. For that it is often
possible to vomit up by means of medicines, or by food to quiet: 
but envy twineth not in entrails but harboreth in the bosom of the
soul, and is a passion hard to be effaced. And indeed if such a
serpent were within one, it would not touch men’s bodies so long
as it had a supply of food; but envy, even though thou spread for
it ever so endless a banquet, devoureth the soul itself, gnawing on
every side, tearing, tugging, and it is not possible to find any
palliative whereby to make it quit its madness, save one only, the
adversity of the prosperous; so is it appeased, nay rather, not so
even. For even should this man suffer adversity, yet still he
sees some other prosperous, and is possessed by the same pangs, and
everywhere are wounds, everywhere blows. For it is not possible
to live in the world and not see persons well reputed of. And
such is the extravagance of this distemper, that even if one should
shut its victim up at home, he envies the men of old who are
dead.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxvii-p25">Now, that men of the world should feel in this
way, is indeed a grievous thing, yet it is not so very dreadful;
but that those who are freed from the turmoils of busy life should
be possessed by this distemper,—this is most grievous of all.
And I could have wished indeed to be silent: and if silence took
away too the disgrace of those doings, it were a gain to say
nothing: if however, though I should hold my peace the doings
will cry out more loudly than my tongue, no harm will accrue from
my words, because of their parading<note place="end" n="1010" id="v.xxvii-p25.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxvii-p26"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxvii-p26.1">ἐ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.xxvii-p26.2">κπομπευομένων</span>.</p></note> these evils before us, but
possibly some gain and advantage. For this distemper has infected
even the Church, it has turned everything topsy-turvy, and
dissevered the connection of the body, and we stand opposed to each
other, and envy supplies us arms. Therefore great is the
disruption. For if when all build up, it is a great thing if our
disciples stand; when all at once are pulling down, what will the
end be?</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxvii-p27">[4.] What doest thou, O man? Thou thinkest to
pull down thy neighbor’s; but before his thou pullest down thine
own. Seest thou not them that are gardeners, that are husbandmen,
how they all concur in one object? One hath dug the soil, another
planted, a third carefully covered the roots, another watereth what
is planted, another hedges it round and fortifies it, another
drives off the cattle; and all look to one end, the safety of the
plant. Here, however, it is not so: but I plant indeed myself,
and another shakes and disturbs [the plant.] At least, allow it
to get nicely fixed, that it may be strong enough to resist the
assault. Thou destroyest not my work, but abandonest thine own.
I planted, thou oughtest to have watered. If then thou shake it,
thou hast torn it up by the roots, and hast not wherein to display
thy watering. But thou seest the planter highly esteemed. Fear
not: neither am I anything, nor thou. “For neither is he that
planteth nor he that watereth any thing;” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. iii. 7" id="v.xxvii-p27.1" parsed="|1Cor|3|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.3.7">1 Cor. iii. 7</scripRef>.) one’s is the work,
God’s. So it is with Him thou fightest and warrest, in plucking
up what is planted.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxvii-p28">Let us then at length come to our sober senses
again, let us watch. For I fear not so much the battle without,
as the fight within; for the root also, when it is well fitted into
the ground, will suffer no damage from the winds; but if it be
itself shaken, a worm gnawing through it from within, the tree will
fall, even though none molest it. How long gnaw we the root of
the Church like worms? For of earth such imaginings are begotten
also, or rather not of earth, but of dung, having corruption for
their mother; and they cease not from the detestable flattery that
is from women<note place="end" n="1011" id="v.xxvii-p28.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxvii-p29"> Old Lat. ‘we cease not;’ in either case he
means, ‘preachers cease not to court such flattery.’</p></note>. Let us
at length be generous men, let us be champions of philosophy, let
us drive back the violent career of these evils. For I behold the
mass of the Church prostrate now, as though it were a corpse. And
as in a body newly dead, one may see eyes and hands and feet and
neck and head, and yet no one limb performing its proper
<pb n="407" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_407.html" id="v.xxvii-Page_407" />office; so, truly, here
also, all who are here are of the faithful, but their faith is not
active; for we have quenched its warmth and made the body of Christ
a corpse. Now if this sounds awful when said, it is much more
awful when it appears in actions. For we have indeed the name of
brothers, but do the deeds of foes; and whilst all are called
members, we are divided against each other like wild beasts. I
have said this not from a desire to parade our condition, but to
shame you and make you desist. Such and such a man goes into a
house; honor is paid to him; thou oughtest to give God thanks
because thy member is honored and God is glorified; but thou doest
the contrary: thou speakest evil of him to the man that honored
him, so that thou trippest up the heels of both, and, besides,
disgracest thyself. And wherefore, wretched and miserable one? 
Hast thou heard thy brother praised, either amongst men or women?<note place="end" n="1012" id="v.xxvii-p29.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxvii-p30"> Bened. inserts, ‘and hast been grieved,’
but the insertion is not countenanced by the <span class="c18" id="v.xxvii-p30.1">
mss</span>.</p></note>  Add to
his praises, for so thou shalt praise thyself also. But if thou
overthrow the praise, first, thou hast spoken evil of thyself,
having so acquired an ill character, and thou hast raised him the
higher. When thou hearest one praised, become thou a partner in
what is said; if not in thy life and virtue, yet still in rejoicing
over his excellencies. Hath such an one praised? Do thou too
admire: so shall he praise thee also as good and candid. Fear
not, as though thou wast ruining thine own interest by thy praises
of another: for this is [rather] the result of accusation of
him. For mankind is of a contentious spirit; and when it sees
thee speaking ill of any, it heaps on its praises, wishing to
mortify by so doing; and reprobates those that are accusers, both
in its own mind and to others. Seest thou what disgrace we are
the causes of to ourselves? how we destroy and rend the flock? 
Let us at length be members (of one another), let us become one
body. And let him that is praised repudiate the praises, and
transfer the encomium to his brother; and let him that hears
another praised, feel pleasure to himself. If we thus come
together ourselves, we shall also draw unto ourselves the Head; but
if we live parted<note place="end" n="1013" id="v.xxvii-p30.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxvii-p31"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxvii-p31.1">διῳκισμένοι</span>.</p></note> from each other, we shall also put
from us the aid which comes from thence; and when that is put
aside, the body will receive great damage, not being bound
together<note place="end" n="1014" id="v.xxvii-p31.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxvii-p32"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxvii-p32.1">σφιγγόμενον</span>.</p></note> from
above. That this then may not happen, let us, banishing ill will
and envy, and despising what the many may think of us, embrace love
and concord. For thus we shall obtain both the present good
things and those to come; whereunto may we all attain, through the
grace and love towards men of our Lord Jesus Christ, with Whom to
the Father together with the Holy Ghost, be glory, might, honor,
now and forever, and world without end. Amen.</p>

<p class="c24" id="v.xxviii-p4"><span class="c18" id="v.xxviii-p4.1">Paul</span> has spoken these
words very obscurely, but not without a meaning or purpose. For
seeing he was speaking about money, and his defence on that score,
it is reasonable that what he says must be wrapt in obscureness.
What then is the meaning of what he says? He had said, ‘I
received not, nay I am ready even to give besides, and to spend;’
and much discourse is made on this subject both in the former
Epistle and in this. Now he says something else, introducing the
subject in the form of an objection and meeting it by
anticipation.<note place="end" n="1015" id="v.xxviii-p4.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxviii-p5"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxviii-p5.1">προηγουμενως</span>.</p></note>  What he
says is something like this; ‘I indeed have not made a gain of
you: but perhaps some one has it to say that I did not receive
[of you] indeed myself, but, being crafty, I procured those who
were sent by me to ask for something of you as for themselves<note place="end" n="1016" id="v.xxviii-p5.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxviii-p6"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxviii-p6.1">εἰς οἰκεῖον
πρόσωπον</span>.</p></note>, and
through them I myself received, yet keeping myself clear of seeming
to receive, by receiving through others. But none can have this
to say either; and you are witnesses.’ Wherefore also he
proceeds by question, saying, “I exhorted Titus, and with him I
sent the brother. Did Titus make a gain of you?” ‘walked he
not just as I walked.’ That is to say, neither did he
receive. Seest thou how intense a strictness [is here], in that
he <pb n="408" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_408.html" id="v.xxviii-Page_408" />not only keeps
himself clear of that receiving, but so modulates those also who
are sent by him that he may not give so much as a slight pretence
to those who were desirous of attacking him. For this is far
greater than that which the Patriarch did. (<scripRef passage="Gen. xiv. 24" id="v.xxviii-p6.2" parsed="|Gen|14|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.14.24">Gen. xiv. 24</scripRef>.) For he indeed, when
he had returned from his victory, and the king would have given him
the spoil, refused to accept aught save what the men had eaten; but
this man neither himself enjoyed [from them] his necessary food,
nor allowed his partners to partake of such: thus abundantly
stopping the mouths of the shameless. Wherefore he makes no
assertion, nor does he say that they did not receive either; but
what was far more than this, he cites the Corinthians themselves as
witnesses that they had received nothing, that he may not seem to
be witnessing in his own person, but by their verdict; which course
we are accustomed to take in matters fully admitted and about which
we are confident. ‘For tell me,’ he says, ‘Did any one of
those who were sent by us make unfair gain<note place="end" n="1017" id="v.xxviii-p6.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxviii-p7"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxviii-p7.1">ἐ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.xxviii-p7.2">πλεονέκτησεν</span>.</p></note> of you?’ He did not say,
‘Did any one receive aught from you?’ but he calls the things
‘unfair gain;’ attacking them and shaming them exceedingly, and
showing that to receive of an unwilling [giver] is ‘unfair
gain.’ And he said not ‘did Titus?’ but, “did any?”
‘For ye cannot say this either,’ he says, ‘that such an one
certainly did not receive, but another did. No single one of
those who came did so.’ “I exhorted Titus.” This too is
severely<note place="end" n="1018" id="v.xxviii-p7.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxviii-p8"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxviii-p8.1">πληκτικῶς</span>.</p></note> said.
For he did not say, ‘I sent Titus,’ but, ‘I exhorted’ him;
showing that if he had received even, he would have done so justly;
but, nevertheless, even so he remained pure. Wherefore he asks
them again, saying, “Did Titus take any advantage of you? 
Walked we not by the same spirit?” What means, “by the same
spirit?” He ascribes the whole to grace and shows that the
whole of this praise is the good result not of our labors, but of
the gift of the Spirit and of Grace. For it was a very great
instance of grace that although both in want and hunger they would
receive nothing for the edification of the disciples. “Walked
we not in the same steps?” That is to say, they did not depart
the least from this strictness, but preserved the same rule
entire.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxviii-p11">Seest thou how he is continually in fear, lest he
should incur the suspicion of flattery? Seest thou an Apostle’s
prudence, how constantly he mentions this? For he said before,
“We commend not ourselves again, but give you occasion to
glory;” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. v. 12" id="v.xxviii-p11.1" parsed="|2Cor|5|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.5.12">2 Cor. v.

commendation?” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. 3.1" id="v.xxviii-p11.2" parsed="|2Cor|3|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.3.1">ib. iii. 1</scripRef>.)</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxviii-p12">“But all things are for your edifying.” Again
he is soothing them. And he does not here either say clearly,
‘on this account we receive not, because of your weakness;’
but, ‘in order that we may edify you;’ speaking out indeed more
clearly than he did before, and revealing that wherewith he
travailed; but yet without severity. For he did not say,
‘because of your weakness;’ but, ‘that ye may be
edified.’</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxviii-p13"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 12.20" id="v.xxviii-p13.1" parsed="|2Cor|12|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.12.20">Ver. 20</scripRef>. “For I fear, lest by any
means when I come, I should not find you such as I would, and
should myself be found of you such as ye would not.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxviii-p14">He is going to say something great and
offensive. And therefore he also inserts this excuse [for it],
both by saying, “All things are for your edifying,” and by
adding, “I fear,” softening the harshness of what was presently
going to be said. For it was not here out of arrogance nor the
authority of a teacher, but out of a father’s tender concern,
when he is more fearful and trembling than the sinners themselves
at that which is likely to reform them. And not even so does he
run them down or make an absolute assertion; but says doubtingly,
“lest by any means when I come, I should not find you such as I
would.” He did not say, ‘not virtuous,’ but “not such as
I would,” everywhere employing the terms of affection. And the
words, “I should find,” are of one who would express what is
out of natural expectation, as are also those, “I shall be found
by you.” For the thing is not of deliberate choice, but of a
necessity originating with you. Wherefore he says, “I should be
found such as ye would not.” He said not here, “such as I
would not,” but, with more severity, “such as ye wish not.”
For it would in that case become his own will, not indeed what he
would first have willed, but his will nevertheless. For he might
indeed have said again, ‘such as I would not,’ and so have
showed his love: but he wishes not to relax<note place="end" n="1020" id="v.xxviii-p14.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxviii-p15"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxviii-p15.1">ἐ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.xxviii-p15.2">κλῦσαι</span>.</p></note> his hearer. Yea rather, his
words would in that case have been even harsher; but now he has at
once dealt them a smarter blow and showed himself more gentle.
For this is the characteristic of his wisdom; cutting more deeply,
to strike more gently. Then, because he had spoken obscurely, he
unveils his meaning, saying,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxviii-p16">“Lest there be strife, jealousy, wraths,
backbitings, whisperings, swellings.”<note place="end" n="1021" id="v.xxviii-p16.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxviii-p17"> The Received Text has ‘factions’ after
‘wraths,’ and ‘tumults’ after ‘swellings,’ which
Chrysostom omits.</p></note></p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxviii-p18">And what he might well put first, that he <pb n="409" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_409.html" id="v.xxviii-Page_409" />puts last: for they were very
proud<note place="end" n="1022" id="v.xxviii-p18.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxviii-p19"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxviii-p19.1">ἀ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.xxviii-p19.2">πενοοῦντο</span>.</p></note> against
him. Therefore, that he may not seem principally to be seeking
his own, he first mentions what was common. For all these things
were gendered of envy, their slanderings, accusations,
dissensions. For just like some evil root, envy produced wrath,
accusation, pride, and all those other evils, and by them was
increased further,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxviii-p20"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 12.21" id="v.xxviii-p20.1" parsed="|2Cor|12|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.12.21">Ver. 21</scripRef>. And “lest when I come
again, my God should humble me among you.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxviii-p21">And the word “again,” too, is as smiting them.
For he means, ‘What happened before is enough;’ as he said also
in the beginning [of the Epistle], “to spare you, I came not as
yet to Corinth.” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. 1.18,23" id="v.xxviii-p21.1" parsed="|2Cor|1|18|0|0;|2Cor|1|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.1.18 Bible:2Cor.1.23">Chap. i. 18, 23</scripRef>.) Seest thou how he
shows both indignation and tender affection? But what means,
“will humble me?” And yet this is glorious rather, to accuse,
to take vengeance, to call to account, to be seated in the place of
judge; howbeit he calls it a humbling. So far was he from being
ashamed of that [cause of] humbling, because, “his bodily
presence was weak, and his speech of no account,” that he wished
to be even for ever in that case, and deprecated the contrary.
And he says this more clearly as he proceeds; and he counts this to
be especially humbling, to be involved in such a necessity as the
present, of punishing and taking vengeance. And wherefore did he
not say, ‘lest when I come I shall be humbled,’ but, “lest
when I come my God will humble me.” ‘Because had it not been
for His sake, I should have paid no attention nor been anxious.
For it is not as possessing authority and for my own pleasure, that
I demand satisfaction,<note place="end" n="1023" id="v.xxviii-p21.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxviii-p22"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxviii-p22.1">αὐθαδιζόμενος</span>.</p></note> but because of His
commandment.’ Now above, indeed, he expressed himself thus,
“I shall be found;” here, however, he relaxes and adopts milder
and gentler language, saying,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxviii-p23">“I shall mourn for many of them who have
sinned.” Not simply, “who have sinned,” but,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxviii-p24">“Who have not repented.” And he said not,
‘all,’ but “many;” nor made it clear who these were either,
thereby making the return unto repentance easy to them; and to make
it plain that a repentance is able to right transgressions, he
bewails those that repent not, those who are incurably diseased,
those who continue in their wounds. Observe then Apostolic
virtue, in that, conscious of no evil in himself, he laments over
the evils of others and is humbled for other men’s
transgressions. For this is the especial mark of a teacher, so to
sympathize with the calamities of his disciples, and to mourn over
the wounds of those who are under him. Then he mentions also the
specific sin.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxviii-p25">“Of the lasciviousness and uncleanness which they
committed.” Now in these words he alludes indeed to
fornication; but if one carefully examine the subject, every kind
of sin can be called by this name. For although the fornicator
and adulterer is preeminently styled unclean, yet still the other
sins also produce uncleanness in the soul. And therefore it is
that Christ also calls the Jews unclean, not charging them with
fornication only, but with wickedness of other kinds as well.
Wherefore also He says that they made the outside clean, and that
“not the things which enter in defile the man, but those which
come out from him;” (<scripRef passage="Matt. xv. 11" id="v.xxviii-p25.1" parsed="|Matt|15|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.15.11">Matt. xv. 11</scripRef>.) and it is said in another
place, “Every one that is proud in heart is unclean before the
Lord.” (<scripRef passage="Prov. xvi. 5" id="v.xxviii-p25.2" parsed="|Prov|16|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Prov.16.5">Prov. xvi.
5</scripRef>. LXX.)</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxviii-p26">[3.] For nothing is purer than virtue,
nothing uncleaner than vice; for the one is brighter than the sun,
the other more stinking than mire. And to this they will
themselves bear witness, who are wallowing in that mire and living
in that darkness; at any rate, when one prepares them a little to
see clearly. For as long as they are by themselves, and inebriate
with the passion, just as if living in darkness they lie in
unseemly wise to their much infamy, conscious even then where they
are, although not fully; but after they have seen any of those who
live in virtue reproving them or even showing himself, then they
understand their own wretchedness more clearly; and as if a sunbeam
had darted upon them, they cover up their own unseemliness and
blush before those who know of their doings, yea, though the one be
a slave and the other free, though the one be a king and the other
a subject. Thus when Ahab saw Elijah, he was ashamed, even when
he<note place="end" n="1024" id="v.xxviii-p26.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxviii-p27"> Elijah.</p></note> had as yet
said nothing; standing convicted by the mere sight of him; and when
his accuser was silent, he pronounced a judgment condemnatory of
himself; uttering the language of such as are caught, and saying,
“Thou hast found me, O mine enemy!” (<scripRef passage="1 Kings xxi. 20" id="v.xxviii-p27.1" parsed="|1Kgs|21|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Kgs.21.20">1 Kings xxi. 20</scripRef>.) Thus Elijah himself
conversed with that tyrant then with great boldness. Thus Herod,
unable to bear the shame of those reproofs, (which [shame] the
sound of the prophet’s tongue with mighty and transparent
clearness exposed more evidently,) cast John into the prison: 
like one who was naked and attempting to put out the light, that he
might be in the dark again; or rather he himself dared not put it
out, but, as it were, placed it in the house under a bushel; and
that wretched and miserable woman compelled it to be done. But
not even so could they cover the reproof, nay, they lit it up the
more. For both <pb n="410" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_410.html" id="v.xxviii-Page_410" />they that
asked, Wherefore doth John dwell in prison? learnt the reason, and
all they that since have dwelt on land or sea, who then lived, or
now live, and who shall be hereafter, both have known and shall
know clearly these wicked tragedies, both that of their lewdness
and that of their bloodguiltiness, and no time shall be able to
wipe out the remembrance of them.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxviii-p28">So great a thing is virtue: so immortal is its
memory, so completely even by words only doth it strike down its
adversaries. For wherefore did he cast him into the prison? 
Wherefore did he not despise him? Was he going to drag him before
the judgment-seat? Did he demand vengeance upon him for his
adultery? Was not what he said then simply a reproof? Why then
doth he fear and tremble? Was it not words and talk merely? But
they stung him more than deeds. He led him not to any
judgment-seat, but he dragged him before that other tribunal of
conscience; and he sets as judges upon him all who freely gave
their verdicts in their thought. Therefore the tyrant trembled,
unable to endure the lustre of virtue. Seest thou how great a
thing is philosophy? It made a prisoner more lustrous than a
king, and the latter is afraid and trembles before him. He indeed
only put him in bonds; but that polluted woman rushed on to his
slaughter also, although the rebuke was leveled rather against him,
[than herself.] For he did not then meet “her” and say, Why
cohabitest thou with the king? not that she was guiltless, (how
should she be so?) but he wished by that other means to put all to
rights. Wherefore he blamed the king, and yet not him with
violence of manner. For he did not say, O polluted and
all-polluted and lawless and profane one, thou hast trodden under
foot the law of God, thou hast despised the commandments, thou hast
made thy might law. None of these things; but even in his
rebukings great was the gentleness of the man, great his
meekness. For, “It is not lawful for thee,” he says, “to
have thy brother Philip’s wife.” The words are those of one
who teacheth rather than reproveth, instructeth rather than
chasteneth, who composeth to order rather than exposeth, who
amendeth rather than trampleth on him. But, as I said, the light
is hateful to the thief, and the mere sight of the just man is
odious to sinners; “for he is grievous unto us even to
behold.” (<scripRef passage="Wisdom of Solomon ii. 15" id="v.xxviii-p28.1" parsed="|Wis|2|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Wis.2.15">Wisdom of
Solomon ii. 15</scripRef>.) For
they cannot bear his radiance, even as diseased eyes cannot bear
the sun’s. But to many of the wicked he is grievous not to
behold only, but even to hear of. And therefore that polluted and
all-polluted woman, the procuress of her girl, yea rather her
murderess, although she had never seen him nor heard his voice,
rushed on to his slaughter; and prepareth her whom she brought up
in lasciviousnss to proceed also to murder, so extravagantly did
she fear him.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxviii-p29">[4.] And what says she? “Give me here in a
charger the head of John the Baptist.” (<scripRef passage="Matt. xiv. 8" id="v.xxviii-p29.1" parsed="|Matt|14|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.14.8">Matt. xiv. 8</scripRef>.) Whither rushest thou
over precipices, wretched and miserable one? What? is the accuser
before thee? is he in sight and troubleth thee? Others said,
“He is grievous unto us even to behold;” but to her, as I said,
he was grievous to even hear of. Wherefore she saith, “Give me
here in a charger the head of John.” And yet because of thee he
inhabits a prison, and is laden with chains, and thou art free to
wanton over thy love and to say, ‘So completely have I subdued
the king, that though publicly reproached he yielded not, nor
desisted from his passion, nor tore asunder his adulterous
connection with me, but even put him that reproached him in
bonds.’ Why art thou mad and rabid, when even after that
reproof of his sin thou retainest thy paramour? Why seekest thou
a table of furies, and preparest a banquet of avenging demons? 
Seest thou how nothing-worth,<note place="end" n="1025" id="v.xxviii-p29.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxviii-p30"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxviii-p30.1">οὐδαμινὸν</span>.</p></note> how cowardly, how unmanly, is
vice; how when it shall most succeed, it then becomes more
feeble? For this woman was not so much disturbed before she had
cast John into prison, as she is troubled after he is bound, and
she is urgent, saying, “Give me here in a charger the head of
John.” And wherefore so? ‘I fear,’ she says, ‘lest
there be any<note place="end" n="1026" id="v.xxviii-p30.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxviii-p31"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxviii-p31.1">συσκιασθῇ ὁ φόνος</span>.</p></note> hushing up
of his murder, lest any should rescue him from his peril.’ And
wherefore requirest thou not the whole corpse, but the head? 
‘The tongue,’ she says, ‘that pained me, that I long to see
silent.’ But the contrary will happen, as indeed it also hath
done, thou wretched and miserable one! it will cry louder
afterwards, when it is cut out. For then indeed it cried in
Judæa only, but now it will reach to the ends of the world; and
wheresoever thou enterest into a church, whether it be among the
Moors, or among the Persians, or even unto the British isles
themselves, thou hearest John crying, “It is not lawful for thee
to have thy brother Phillip’s wife.” But she, unknowing to
reason in any such way, urges and presses,<note place="end" n="1027" id="v.xxviii-p31.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxviii-p32"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxviii-p32.1">ἄ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.xxviii-p32.2">γχεί</span>.</p></note> and thrusts on the senseless
tyrant to the murder, fearing lest he change his mind. But from
this too learn thou again the power of virtue. Not even when he
was shut up and bound and silent, does she bear the righteous
man. Seest thou how weak a thing vice is? how unclean? For in
the place of meats it bringeth in a human head upon a charger.
What is more polluted, what more accursed, <pb n="411" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_411.html" id="v.xxviii-Page_411" />what more immodest, than that damsel?
what a voice she uttered in that theatre of the devil, in that
banquet of demons!  Seest thou this tongue and that; the one
bringing healthful medicines, the other one with poison on it, and
made the purveyor to a devilish banquet. But wherefore did she
not command him to be murdered within there, at the feast, when her
pleasure would have been greater? She feared lest if he should
come thither and be seen, he should change them all by his look, by
his boldness. Therefore surely it is that she demandeth his head,
wishing to set up a bright trophy of fornication; and give it to
her mother. Seest thou the wages of dancing, seest thou the
spoils of that devilish plot? I mean not the head of John, but
her paramour himself. For if one examine it carefully, against
the king that trophy was set up, and the victress was vanquished,
and the beheaded was crowned, and proclaimed victor, even after his
death shaking more vehemently the hearts of the offenders. And
that what I have said is no [mere] boast, ask of Herod himself;
who, when he heard of the miracles of Christ, said, “This is
John, he is risen from the dead: and therefore do these powers
work in him.” (<scripRef passage="Matt. xiv. 2" id="v.xxviii-p32.3" parsed="|Matt|14|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.14.2">Matt.

fear, so abiding the agony he retained; and none had power to cast
down the terror of his conscience, but that incorruptible Judge
continued to take him by the throat, and day by day to demand of

and his much tender affection, one may observe in many other
circumstances, but especially in this, his being so abundant and
vehement in his admonitions, but so tardy and procrastinating in
his punishments. For he did not chastise them immediately on
their sinning, but warned them once and again; and not even so,
upon their paying no attention, does he exact punishment, but warns
again, saying, “This is the third time I am coming to you;” and
‘before I come I write again.’ Then, that his procrastinating
may not produce indifference,<note place="end" n="1030" id="v.xxix-p5.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxix-p6"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxix-p6.1">φιλοσοφίαν</span>.</p></note> see how he corrects this result
also, by threatening continually and holding the blow suspended
over them, and saying, “If I come again I will not spare;” and
“lest when I come again I should mourn for many.” These
things, then, he doeth and speaketh, in this too imitating the Lord
of all: because that God also threateneth indeed continually and
warneth often, but not often chastiseth and punisheth. And so in
truth also doth Paul, and therefore he said also before, “To
spare you I came not as yet to Corinth.” What is, “to spare
you?” Lest finding you to have sinned and to continue
unamended, I should visit with chastisement and punishment. And
here, “This is the third time I am coming to you. At the mouth
of two witnesses or three shall every word be established.” He
joins the unwritten to the written, as he has done also in another
place, saying, “He that is joined to an harlot is one body; for
the twain,” saith He, “shall become one flesh.”

conveniently, so as to terrify them the more. And so he doth here
also, setting his comings and his warnings in the place of
witnesses. And what he says is 
<pb n="412" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_412.html" id="v.xxix-Page_412" />this: ‘I spoke once and again when I was with
you; I speak also now by letter. And if indeed ye attend to me,
what I desired is accomplished; but if ye pay no attention, it is
necessary henceforth to stop speaking, and to inflict the
punishment.’ Wherefore he says,</p>

“I have said beforehand, and I do say beforehand when I was
present the second time; so now being absent I write to them that
sinned heretofore and to all the rest, that if I come again, I will
not spare.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxix-p10">‘For if at the mouth of two witnesses or
three every word shall be established, and I have come twice and

my writing is of less account than my coming; for as I spoke when
present, so now I write also when absent.’ Seest thou his
fraternal solicitude? Seest thou forethought becoming a
teacher? He neither kept silence nor punished, but he both
foretells often, and continues ever threatening, and puts off the
punishment, and if they should continue unamended, then he
threatens to bring it to the proof. ‘But what didst thou tell
them before when present, and when absent writest?’ “That if
I come again, I will not spare.” Having showed before that he
is unable to do this unless he is compelled, and having called the
thing a mourning, and a humbling; (for he saith, “lest my God
should humble me before you, and I should mourn for them that have
sinned heretofore, and not repented;—<scripRef passage="2 Cor. 12.21" id="v.xxix-p11.3" parsed="|2Cor|12|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.12.21">Chap.

his excuse unto them, namely, that he had told them before, once
and twice and thrice, and that he does and contrives all he can so
as to hold back the punishment, and by the fear of his words to
make them better, he then used this unpleasing and terrifying
expression, “If I come again, I will not spare.” He did not
say, ‘I will avenge and punish and exact satisfaction:’ but
again expresses even punishment itself in paternal language;
showing his tender affection, and his heart to be grieved along
with them; because that he always to “spare” them put off.
Then that they may not think now also that there will be again a
putting off, and merely a threat in words, therefore he both said
before, “At the mouth of two witnesses or three shall every word
be established;” and [now], “If I come again, I will not
spare.” Now what he means is this: ‘I will no longer put
off, if (which God forbid) I find you unamended; but will certainly
visit it, and make good what I have said.’</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxix-p12">[2.] Then with much anger and vehement indignation
against those who make a mock of him as weak, and ridicule his
presence, and say, “his presence is weak, and his speech of no

“Seeing that ye seek a proof of Christ that speaketh in
me.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxix-p15">For he said this, dealing at once a blow at
these, and at the same time lashing those<note place="end" n="1035" id="v.xxix-p15.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxix-p16"> i.e. the Corinthians themselves.</p></note> also. Now what he means is this;
‘Since ye are desirous of proving whether Christ dwelleth in me,
and call me to an account, and on this score make a mock of me as
mean and despicable, as if I were destitute of that Power; ye shall
know that we are not destitute, if ye give us occasion, which God
forbid.’ What then? tell me. Dost thou therefore punish,
because they seek a proof? ‘No,’ he says; for had he sought
this, he would have punished them at the first on their sinning,
and would not have put off. But that he does not seek this, he
has shown more clearly as he proceeds, saying, “Now I pray that
ye do no evil, not that we may appear approved, but that ye may be
approved, though we be as reprobates.” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. 13.7" id="v.xxix-p16.1" parsed="|2Cor|13|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.13.7">Ver.

<p class="c19" id="v.xxix-p17">He doth not employ those words then as
assigning a reason,<note place="end" n="1036" id="v.xxix-p17.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxix-p18"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxix-p18.1">αἰτιολογικῶς</span>.</p></note> but rather in indignation, rather
as attacking those that despise him. ‘For,’ he says, ‘I
have no desire indeed to give you such a proof, but if you
yourselves should furnish cause and should choose to challenge me,
ye shall know by very deeds.’ And observe how grievous he makes
what he says. For he said not, ‘Since ye seek a proof of me,’
but “of Christ that speakest in me, showing that it was against
Him they sinned.” And he did not say merely, ‘dwelling in
me,’ but “speaking in me,” showing that his words are
spiritual. But if he doth not display His power nor punish, (for
thenceforward the Apostle transferred what he said from himself to
Christ, thus making his threat more fearful,) it is not from
weakness; for He can do it: but from long suffering. Let none
then think His forbearance to be weakness. For why marvellest
thou that He doth not now proceed against sinners, nor in his
forbearance and long suffering exacts satisfaction, seeing that He
endured even to be crucified, and though suffering such things
punished not? Wherefore also he added,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxix-p19"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 13.3,4" id="v.xxix-p19.1" parsed="|2Cor|13|3|13|4" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.13.3-2Cor.13.4">Ver. 3, 4</scripRef>. “Who to you-ward is not
weak, but is mighty in you. For though He was crucified through
weakness, yet He liveth through the Power of God.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxix-p20">These words have much obscurity and give disturbance
to the weaker sort. Wherefore it is necessary to unfold them more
clearly, and to explain the signification of the expression as to
which the obscurity exists, that no one may be offended, even of
the simpler sort. <pb n="413" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_413.html" id="v.xxix-Page_413" />What
then, at all, is that which is here said, and what the term
“weakness” designates, and in what signification it is used, it
is necessary to learn. For the term is indeed one, but it has
many meanings. For bodily sickness is termed ‘weakness:’
whence it is even said in the Gospel, “Behold, he whom Thou
lovest is weak,”<note place="end" n="1037" id="v.xxix-p20.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxix-p21"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxix-p21.1">ἀ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.xxix-p21.2">σθενεῖ</span>, A.V. <i>is sick</i>.</p></note> (<scripRef passage="John xi. 3, 4" id="v.xxix-p21.3" parsed="|John|11|3|11|4" osisRef="Bible:John.11.3-John.11.4">John xi. 3, 4</scripRef>.) concerning Lazarus; and He
Himself said, “This weakness is not unto death;” and Paul,
speaking of Epaphras, “For indeed he was weak nigh unto death,
but God had mercy on him;” (<scripRef passage="Philip. ii. 57" id="v.xxix-p21.4" parsed="|Phil|2|57|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Phil.2.57">Philip. ii. 57</scripRef>.) and of Timothy, “Use a
little wine for thy stomach’s sake and thine often
weaknesses.” (<scripRef passage="1 Tim. v. 23" id="v.xxix-p21.5" parsed="|1Tim|5|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.5.23">1 Tim.
v. 23</scripRef>.) For all these
denote bodily sickness. Again, the not being established firmly
in the faith is called ‘weakness;’ the not being perfect and
complete. And denoting this Paul said, “Him that is weak in the
faith receive ye but not to doubtful disputations:” (<scripRef passage="Rom. xiv. 1, 2" id="v.xxix-p21.6" parsed="|Rom|14|1|14|2" osisRef="Bible:Rom.14.1-Rom.14.2">Rom. xiv. 1, 2</scripRef>.) and again, “One believeth
that he may eat all things; another, who is weak, eateth herbs,”
denoting him who is weak in the faith. Here then are two
significations of the term ‘weakness;’ there is yet a third
thing which is called ‘weakness.’ What then is this? 
Persecutions, plottings, insults, trials, assaults. And denoting
this Paul said, “For this thing I besought the Lord thrice. And
He said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for My power is
made perfect in weakness.” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. 12.8,9" id="v.xxix-p21.7" parsed="|2Cor|12|8|12|9" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.12.8-2Cor.12.9">Chap. xii. 8, 9</scripRef>.) What is “in
weakness?” In persecutions, in dangers, in trials, in
plottings, in deaths. And denoting this he said, Wherefore, I
take pleasure in weakness.<note place="end" n="1038" id="v.xxix-p21.8"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxix-p22"> A.V. <i>infirmities</i>.</p></note>  Then showing what kind of
weakness he means, he spake not of fever, nor of doubt about the
faith; but what? “in injuries, in necessities, in distresses, in
stripes, in imprisonments, that the power of Christ may rest upon
me. For when I am weak, then am I strong.” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. 12.10" id="v.xxix-p22.1" parsed="|2Cor|12|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.12.10">Chap.

to say ‘when I am persecuted, when I am driven up and down, when
I am plotted against, then am I strong, then the rather I prevail
over, and get the better of them that plot against me, because that
grace resteth upon<note place="end" n="1039" id="v.xxix-p22.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxix-p23"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxix-p23.1">ἐ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.xxix-p23.2">νιζανούσης</span>.</p></note> me, more largely. It is then in
this third sense that Paul useth “weakness;” and this is what
he means by it; aiming again, as I said also before, at that point,
his seeming to them to be mean and contemptible. For indeed he
had no desire to boast, nor to seem to be what he really was, nor
yet to display the power which he possessed of punishing and
revenging; whence also he was accounted to be mean. When then as
so accounting they were going on in great indifference and
insensibility, and repented not of their sins, he seizes a
favorable opportunity, discourses with much vigor upon these points
also, and shows that it was not from weakness he did nothing, but
from long-suffering.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxix-p24">[3.] Then, as I said, by transferring the argument
from himself to Christ, he enhances their fear, he increases his
threat. And what he says is this; ‘for even supposing I should
do something and chastise and take vengeance on the guilty ones, is
it I that chastise and take vengeance? it is He that dwelleth in
me, Christ Himself. But if ye do not believe this, but are
desirous of receiving a proof by deeds of Him that dwelleth in me,
ye shall know presently; “For he is not weak to you-ward, but is
even powerful.”’ And wherefore added he “to you-ward,”
seeing He is mighty everywhere? for should He be minded to punish
unbelievers, He is able; or demons, or anything whatsoever. What
then is the import of the addition? The expression is either as
shaming them exceedingly by remembrance of the proofs they have
already received; or else as declaring this, that meanwhile He
shows His power in you who ought to be corrected. As he said also
in another place, “For what have I to do to judge them also that
are without?” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. v. 12" id="v.xxix-p24.1" parsed="|1Cor|5|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.5.12">1 Cor.
v. 12</scripRef>.) ‘For those
that are without,’ he says, ‘He will then call to account in
the day of judgment, but you even now, so as to rescue you from
that punishment.’ But nevertheless even this instance of his
solicitude, although arising from tender affection, observe how he
combines with fear and much anger, saying, “Who to you-ward is
not weak, but is powerful in you.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxix-p25"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 13.4" id="v.xxix-p25.1" parsed="|2Cor|13|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.13.4">Ver. 4</scripRef>.
“For though He was crucified through weakness, yet He liveth
through the Power of God.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxix-p26">What is, “though He was crucified through
weakness?” ‘For though He chose,’ he says, ‘to endure a
thing which seems to carry a notion of weakness, still this in no
way breaks in upon<note place="end" n="1040" id="v.xxix-p26.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxix-p27"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxix-p27.1">διακόπτει</span>.</p></note> His Power. That still remains
invincible, and that thing which seemeth to be of weakness, hath
nothing harmed it, nay this very thing itself shows His Power most
of all, in that He endured even such a thing, and yet His Power was
not mutilated.’<note place="end" n="1041" id="v.xxix-p27.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxix-p28"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxix-p28.1">ἠ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.xxix-p28.2">κρωτηριάσθη</span>.</p></note>  Let not then the expression
“weakness” disturb thee; for elsewhere also he says, “The
foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is
stronger than men;” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. i. 55" id="v.xxix-p28.3" parsed="|1Cor|1|55|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.1.55">1 Cor. i. 55</scripRef>.) although in God is nothing
either foolish or weak: but he called the Cross so, as setting
forth the conception of the unbelieving regarding it. Hear him,
at least, interpreting himself. “For the preaching of the Cross
is to them that perish foolishness, but unto us which are saved it
is the pow<pb n="414" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_414.html" id="v.xxix-Page_414" />er of God.”
(<scripRef passage="1 Cor. 1.18" id="v.xxix-p28.4" parsed="|1Cor|1|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.1.18">Ib.
18</scripRef>.) And again; “But
we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumbling-block, and
unto the Greeks foolishness; but unto them which are called, both
Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of
God.” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. 1.23,24" id="v.xxix-p28.5" parsed="|1Cor|1|23|1|24" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.1.23-1Cor.1.24">Ib. 23, 24</scripRef>.) And again; “But the
natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit, for they are
foolishness unto him.” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. ii. 14" id="v.xxix-p28.6" parsed="|1Cor|2|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.2.14">1 Cor. ii. 14</scripRef>.) Observe, how in
every place he expresseth the conception of the unbelieving, who
look upon the Cross as foolishness and weakness. And so, in
truth, here also he means not “weakness” really such, but what
was suspected to be such with the unbelieving. He doth not then
say this, that because He was weak He was crucified. Away with
the thought!  For that He had it in His power not to have been
crucified He showed throughout; when He now cast men down
prostrate, now turned back the beams of the sun, and withered a
fig-tree, and blinded their eyes that came against Him, and wrought
ten thousand other things. What then is this which he says,
“through weakness!” That even although He was crucified after
enduring peril and treachery, (for we have showed that peril and
treachery are called weakness,) yet still He was nothing harmed
thereby. And he said this to draw the example unto his own
case. For since the Corinthians beheld them persecuted, driven
about, despised, and not avenging nor visiting it, in order to
teach them that neither do they so suffer from want of power,<note place="end" n="1042" id="v.xxix-p28.7"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxix-p29"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxix-p29.1">ἀ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.xxix-p29.2">τονίαν</span>.</p></note> nor from
being unable to visit it, he leads on the argument up to The
Master, because ‘He too,’ saith he, ‘was crucified, was
bound, suffered ten thousand things, and He visited them not, but
continued to endure things which appeared to argue weakness, and in
this way displaying His Power, in that although He punishes not nor
requites, He is not injured any thing at all. For instance, the
Cross did not cut asunder His life, nor yet impeded His
resurrection, but He both rose again and liveth.’ And when thou
hearest of the Cross and of life, expect to find the doctrine
concerning the Incarnation,<note place="end" n="1043" id="v.xxix-p29.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxix-p30"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxix-p30.1">τῆς οικονομίας</span>.</p></note> for all that is said here hath
reference to that. And if he says “though the Power of God,”
it is not as though He were Himself void of strength to quicken His
flesh; but it was indifferent with him to mention either Father or
Son. For when he said, “the Power of God,” he said by His own
Power. For that both He Himself raised it up and sustains it,
hear Him saying, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will
raise it up.”  (<scripRef passage="John ii. 19" id="v.xxix-p30.2" parsed="|John|2|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.2.19">John ii. 19</scripRef>.) But if that which is

crucified was nothing harmed,’ he says, ‘so neither are we when

We are persecuted, are driven here and there, suffer extremity.
But what is “with Him?” ‘Because of the preaching,’ he
says, ‘and our faith in Him. But if for His sake we undergo

is pleasant also:’ and so he added, “but we are saved with
Him by the Power of God.”</p>

He seems to me here to speak of the “faith” which relates to
miracles. ‘For if ye have faith,’ he says, “Christ is in
you, except ye have become reprobates.” Seest thou how again he
terrifies them, and shows even to superfluity that Christ is with
Him. For he seems to me to be here alluding to them, even as to
their lives. For since faith is not enough [by itself] to draw
down the energy of the Spirit, and he had said that ‘“if ye are
in the faith” ye have Christ in you,’ and it happened that many
who had faith <pb n="415" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_415.html" id="v.xxix-Page_415" />were
destitute of that energy; in order to solve the difficulty, he
says, “except ye be reprobate,” except [that is] ye are corrupt
in life. “But I hope that ye shall know that we are not
reprobate.” What followed naturally was to have said, “but if
ye have become reprobate, yet we have not.” He doth not,
however, say so, for fear of wounding them, but he hints it in an
obscure manner, without either making the assertion thus, ‘ye are
reprobate,’ or proceeding by question and saying, ‘But if ye
are reprobate,’ but leaving out even this way of putting it by
question, he indicates it obscurely by adding, “But I hope that
ye shall know that we are not reprobate.” Here also again,
great is the threat, great the alarm. ‘For since ye desire,’
he says, ‘in this way, by your own punishment to receive the
proof, we shall have no difficulty in giving you that
demonstration.’ But he does not indeed so express himself, but
with more weight and threatening. “But I hope that ye shall
know that we are not reprobate.” ‘For ye ought indeed,’ he
saith, ‘to have known even without this what we are,<note place="end" n="1048" id="v.xxix-p38.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxix-p39"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxix-p39.1">τὰ ἡμέτερα</span>.</p></note> and that
we have Christ speaking and working in us; but since ye desire to
receive the proof of it by deeds also, ye shall know that we are
not reprobate.’ Then when he has held the threat suspended over
their heads, and brought the punishment now up to their doors, and
has set them a trembling, and made them look for vengeance; see how
again he sweetens down his words and soothes their fear, and shows
his unambitious temper, his tender solicitude towards his
disciples, his high-principledness of purpose, his loftiness and
freedom from vain-glory. For he exhibits all these qualities in
what he adds, saying,</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxix-p40"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. 13.7-9" id="v.xxix-p40.1" parsed="|2Cor|13|7|13|9" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.13.7-2Cor.13.9">Ver. 7, 8, 9</scripRef>. “Now I pray to God that
ye do no evil, not that we may appear approved, but that ye may do
that which is honorable, though we be as reprobate. For we can do
nothing against the truth but for the truth. For we rejoice when
we are weak, and ye are strong. For this also we pray for even
your perfecting.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxix-p41">[5.] What can be equal to this soul? He was
despised, he was spit upon, he was ridiculed, he was mocked, as
mean, as contemptible, as a braggart, as boastful in his words but
in his deeds unable to make even a little show; and although seeing
so great a necessity for showing his own power, he not only puts
off, not only shrinks back, but even prays that he may not fall
into such a position. For he says, “I pray that ye do no evil,
not that we may appear approved, but that ye may do that which is
honorable, though we be as reprobate.” What is it he says? 
‘I entreat God. I beseech Him,’ he says, ‘that I may find
no one unreformed, may find no one’ that has not repented? yea,
rather, not this alone, but that none may have sinned at all.
For,’ he says, ‘that ye have done no [evil], but if ye have
perchance sinned, then that ye may have changed your conduct, and
been beforehand with me in reforming, and arresting all wrath.
For this is not what I am eager about, that we should be approved
in this way, but clean the contrary, that we should not appear
approved. For if ye should continue,’ he says, ‘sinning and
not repenting, it will be necessary for us to chastise, to punish,
to maim your bodies; (as happened in the case of Sapphira and of
Magus;) and we have given proof of our power. But we pray not for
this, but the contrary, that we may not be shown to be approved in
this way, that we may not in this way exhibit the proof of the
power which is in us, by chastising you and punishing you as
sinning and as incurably diseased, but what? “That ye should do
that which is honorable,” we pray for this, that ye should ever
live in virtue, ever in amendment; “and we should be as
reprobate,” not displaying our power of punishing.’ And he
said not, “reprobate” for he would not “be” reprobate, even
though he did not punish, nay rather for this very reason he would
be “approved;” ‘but even if some suspect us,’ he says,
‘on account of our not displaying our power, to be contemptible
and cast away, we care nothing for this. Better we should be so
deemed of by those, than display the power which God hath given to
us in those stripes, and in that unreformedness of heart.’</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxix-p42">“For we can do nothing against the truth,
but for the truth.” For that he may not seem [merely] to be
gratifying them, (for this is what one who was void of vain-glory
might do,) but to be doing what the nature of the thing demanded,
he added this, “for we can do nothing against the truth.”
‘For if we find you,’ he says, ‘in good repute, having driven
away your sins by repentance and having boldness towards God; we
shall not be able thereafter, were we never so willing, to punish
you, but should we attempt it even, God will not work with us.
For to this end gave He us our power that the judgment we give
should be true and righteous, not contrary to the truth.’ Seest
thou how in every way he can, he makes what he says void of
offensiveness, and softens the harshness of his menace? Moreover
as he has eagerly endeavored this, so is he desirous also to show
that his mind was quite joined<note place="end" n="1049" id="v.xxix-p42.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxix-p43"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxix-p43.1">ᾠ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.xxix-p43.2">κειωμένην</span>.</p></note> to them; wherefore also he added,
“For we rejoice when we are weak and ye are strong, and this also
we pray for even your perfecting.” ‘For most certainly,’ he
says, ‘we cannot do any thing against the truth, that is, punish
you if you are well pleasing [to God]; besides, because we
<pb n="416" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_416.html" id="v.xxix-Page_416" />cannot, we therefore do not
wish it, and even desire the contrary. Nay, we are particularly
glad of this very thing, when we find you giving us no occasion to
show that power of ours for punishment. For even if the doing of
such things shows men glorious and approved and strong; still we
desire the contrary, that ye should be approved and unblamable, and
that we should never at any time reap the glory thence
arising.’ Wherefore he says, “For we are glad when we are
weak.” What is, “are weak?” ‘When we may be thought
weak.’ Not when we are weak, but when we are thought weak; for
they were thought so by their enemies, because they displayed not
their power of punishing. ‘But still we are glad, when your
behavior is of such a sort as to give us no pretence for punishing
you. And it is a pleasure to us to be in this way considered
weak, so that only ye be blameless;’ wherefore he adds, “and ye
are strong,” that is, ‘are approved, are virtuous. And we do
not only wish for this, but we pray for this, that ye may be
blameless, perfect, and afford us no handle.’</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxix-p44">[6.] This is paternal affection, to prefer
the salvation of the disciples before his own good name. This is
the part of a soul free from vainglory; this best releaseth from
the bonds of the body and makes one to rise aloft from earth to
heaven, the being pure from vain-glory; just as therefore the
contrary leadeth unto many sins. For it is impossible that one
who is not pure from vain-glory, should be lofty and great and
noble; but he must needs grovel on the ground, and do much damage,
whilst the slave of a polluted mistress, more cruel than any
barbarian. For what can be fiercer than she who, when most
courted, is then most savage? Even wild beasts are not this, but
are tamed by much attention. But vain-glory is quite the
contrary, by being contemned she is made tame, by being honored she
is made savage and is armed against her honorer.  The Jews honored
her and were punished with exceeding severity; the disciples
slighted her and were crowned. And why speak I of punishment and
crowns? for to this very point of being seen to be glorious, it
contributes more than any thing, to spit upon vainglory. And thou
shalt see even in this world that they who honor it are damaged,
whilst those who slight it are benefited. For the disciples who
slighted it, (for there is no obstacle to our using the same
example again,) and preferred the things of God, outshine the sun,
having gained themselves an immortal memory even after their death;
whilst the Jews who crouched<note place="end" n="1050" id="v.xxix-p44.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxix-p45"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxix-p45.1">ὑ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.xxix-p45.2">ποκατακλιθέντες</span>.</p></note> to it are become cityless,
heartless, degraded, fugitives, exiles, mean, contemptible. Do
thou, therefore, if thou desirest to receive glory, repel glory;
but if thou pursuest glory, thou shalt miss glory. And, if ye
will, let us also try this doctrine in worldly matters. For whom
do we make sport of in our jests? Is it not of those whose minds
are set upon it? Certainly then, these men are the most entirely
destitute of it, having countless accusers and being slighted by
all. And whom do we admire, tell me; is it not those who despise
it? Certainly then, these are they that are glorified. For as
he is rich, not who is in need of many things, but who is in need
of nothing; so he is glorious, not who loveth glory, but who
despiseth it; for this glory is but a shadow of glory. No one
having seen a loaf painted, though he should be pressed with hunger
ever so much, will attack the picture. Neither then do thou
pursue these shadows, for this is a shadow of glory, not glory.
And that thou mayest know that this is the manner of it and that it
is a shadow, consider this that it must be so, when the thing hath
a bad name amongst men, when all consider it a thing to be avoided,
they even who desire it; and when he who hath it and he covets it
are ashamed to be called after it. ‘Whence then is this
desire,’ saith one, ‘and how is the passion engendered?’ By
littleness of soul, (for one ought not only to accuse it, but also
to correct it,) by an imperfect mind, by a childish judgment. Let
us then cease to be children, and let us become men: and let us
every where pursue the reality, not the shadows, both in wealth,
and in pleasure, and in luxury, and in glory, and in power; and
this disease will cease, and many others also. For to pursue
shadows is a madman’s part. Wherefore also Paul said, “Awake
up righteously and sin not.” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. xv. 34" id="v.xxix-p45.3" parsed="|1Cor|15|34|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.15.34">1 Cor. xv. 34</scripRef>.) For there is yet
another madness, sorer than that caused by devils, than that from
frenzy. For that admits of forgiveness, but this is destitute of
excuse, seeing the soul itself is corrupted and its right judgment
lost; and that of frenzy indeed is an affection of the body, but
this madness hath its seat in the artificer mind. As then of
fevers those are sorer, yea incurable, which seize upon firm bodies
and lurk in the recesses<note place="end" n="1051" id="v.xxix-p45.4"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxix-p46"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxix-p46.1">ἐ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.xxix-p46.2">νδομυχοῦντες</span>.</p></note> of the nerves and are hidden away
in the veins, so truly is this madness also, seeing it lurks in the
recesses of the mind itself, perverting and destroying it. For
how is it not clear and evident madness, yea, a distemper sorer
than any madness, to despise the things which abide forever, and to
cling with great eagerness to those which perish? For, tell me,
if one were to chase the wind or try to hold it, should we not say
that he was mad? And what? if one should grasp a shadow and
neglect the reality;<note place="end" n="1052" id="v.xxix-p46.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxix-p47"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxix-p47.1">τῶν ἀληθῶν</span>.</p></note> if one 
<pb n="417" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_417.html" id="v.xxix-Page_417" />should hate his own wife and embrace her shadow;
or loathe his son and again love his shadow, wouldest thou seek any
other clearer sign in proof of madness? Such are they also who
greedily follow the present things. For they are all shadow, yea,
whether thou mention glory, or power, or good report, or wealth, or
luxury, or any other thing of this life. And therefore truly it
is that the prophet said, “Surely man walketh in a shadow, yea,
he disquieth himself in vain;” (<scripRef passage="Ps. xxxix. 6" id="v.xxix-p47.2" parsed="|Ps|39|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.39.6">Ps. xxxix. 6</scripRef>.) and again, “Our days
decline like a shadow.” (<scripRef passage="Ps. cii. 11" id="v.xxix-p47.3" parsed="|Ps|102|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.102.11">Ps. cii. 11</scripRef>.) And in another place, he
calls human things smoke and the flower of grass. But it is not
only his good things which are shadow, but his evils also, whether
it be death thou mention, or poverty, or disease, or any other
thing. What then are those things which abide, both good and
evil? The eternal kingdom and the everlasting hell. For
“neither shall the worm die, nor shall the fire be quenched:”
(<scripRef passage="Mark ix. 44" id="v.xxix-p47.4" parsed="|Mark|9|44|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Mark.9.44">Mark ix. 44</scripRef>.) and “these shall rise
again to everlasting life: and these to everlasting
punishment.” (<scripRef passage="Mark xxv. 46" id="v.xxix-p47.5" parsed="|Mark|25|46|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Mark.25.46">Mark
xxv. 46</scripRef>.) That then we
may escape the one and enjoy the other, letting go the shadow, let
us cling to the real things with all earnestness, for so shall we
obtain the kingdom of heaven, which may we all obtain though the
grace and love towards men of our Lord Jesus Christ, to Whom be
glory and might for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

spoken more vehemently than his wont, and especially towards the
end of the Epistle. For he said before, “Now I Paul myself
entreat you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ; I who in your
presence am lowly among you, but being absent am of good courage
towards you: Yea, I beseech you, that I may not be bold when I am
present, with the confidence wherewith I count to be bold against

many of them which have sinned heretofore, and repented not of the
lasciviousness and uncleanness which they committed:” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. 12.21" id="v.xxx-p4.5" parsed="|2Cor|12|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.12.21">Ib.

told you before and foretell you, as if I were present the second
time, and being absent now I write, that, if I come again, I will
not spare; seeing that ye seek a proof of Christ, that speaketh in
me.” (<scripRef passage="2 Cor. 13.2,3" id="v.xxx-p4.6" parsed="|2Cor|13|2|13|3" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.13.2-2Cor.13.3">Chap. xiii. 2, 3</scripRef>.) Since then he had said
these things and more besides, terrifying, shaming, reproaching,
lashing them, he says, in excuse for all, “For this cause I write
these things while absent, that I may not when present deal
sharply.” For I am desirous the sharpness should lie in my
letters and not in my deeds. I wish my threats to be vehement,
that they may continue threats and never go forth into action.
Again even in this his apology he makes what he says more terrible,
showing that it is not himself who is to punish, but God; for he
added, “according to the authority which the Lord gave me;” and
again, to show that he desires not to use his power to their
punishment, he added, “not for casting down, but for building
up.” And he hinted indeed this now, as I said, but he left it
to them to draw the conclusion that if they should continue
unamended, even this again is building up, to punish those that are
of such a mind. For so it is, and he knew it and showed it by his
deeds.</p>

rejoice, be perfected, be comforted, be of the same mind, live in
peace, and the God of love and peace shall be with
you.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxx-p7">What means, “for the rest, brethren, rejoice?”
Thou hast pained, terrified, thrown them into an agony, made them
to tremble and fear, and how biddest thou them rejoice? ‘Why,
for this very reason I bid them rejoice. For,’ he says, ‘if
what is your part follow’ upon mine, there will be nothing to
prevent that joy. For all my part has been done; I have suffered
long, I have delayed, I have forborne to cut off, I have besought,
I have advised, I have alarmed, 
<pb n="418" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_418.html" id="v.xxx-Page_418" />I have threatened, so as by every means to gather
you in unto the fruit of repentance. And now it behoveth that
your part be done, and so your joy will be unfading.’</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxx-p8">“Be perfected.” What is, “be perfected?”
‘Be complete, fill up what is deficient.’</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxx-p9">“Be comforted.” For, since their trials were
numerous, and their perils great, he says, ‘“be comforted,”
both by one another, and by us, and by your change unto the
better. For if ye should have joy of conscience and become
complete, nothing is wanting unto your cheerfulness and comfort.
For nothing doth so produce comfort as a pure conscience, yea,
though innumerable trials surround.’</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxx-p10">“Be of the same mind, live in peace.” The
request he made in the former Epistle also, at the opening. For
it is possible to be of one mind, and yet not to live in peace,
[for instance], when people agree in doctrine, but in their
dealings with each other are at variance. But Paul requires
both.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxx-p11">“And the God of love and peace shall be with
you.” For truly he not only recommends and advises, but also
prays. For either he prays for this, or else foretells what shall
happen; or rather, both. ‘For if ye do these things,’ he
says, ‘for instance, if ye be “of one mind” and “live in
peace,” God also will be with you, for He is “the God of love
and of peace,” and in these things He delighteth, He rejoiceth.
Hence shall peace also be yours from His love; hence shall every
evil be removed. This saved the world, this ended the long war,
this blended together heaven and earth, this made men angels.
This then let us also imitate, for love is the mother of countless
good things. By this we were saved, by this all those unspeakable
good things [come] to us.’</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxx-p12">[2.] Then to lead them on unto it, he says,</p>

treacherous, like the kiss which Judas gave to Christ. For
therefore is the kiss given, that it may be fuel unto love, that it
may kindle the disposition, that we may so love each other, as
brothers brothers, as children parents, as parents children; yea,
rather even far more. For those things are a disposition
implanted by nature, but these by spiritual grace. Thus our souls
bound unto each other. And therefore when we return after an
absence we kiss each other, our souls hastening unto mutual
intercourse. For this is that member which most of all declares
to us the workings of the soul. But about this holy kiss somewhat
else may yet be said. To what effect? We are the temple of
Christ; we kiss then the porch and entrance of the temple when we
kiss each other. See ye not how many kiss even the porch of this
temple, some stooping down, others grasping it with their hand, and
putting their hand to their mouth. And through these gates and
doors Christ both had entered into us, and doth enter, whensoever
we communicate. Ye who partake of the mysteries understand what I
say. For it is in no common manner that our lips are honored,
when they receive the Lord’s Body. It is for this reason
chiefly that we here kiss. Let them give ear who speak filthy
things, who utter railing, and let them shudder to think what that
mouth is they dishonor; let those give ear who kiss obscenely.
Hear what things God hath proclaimed by thy mouth, and keep it
undefiled. He hath discoursed of the life to come, of the
resurrection, of immortality, that death is not death, of those
other innumerable mysteries. For he that is about to be initiated
comes to the priest’s mouth as it were an oracle, to hear things
full of awe. For he lost his life even from his forefathers, and
comes to seek it again, and to ask how he may haply find and get it
back. Then God announceth to him how it may be found, and that
mouth becomes more awful than the very mercy-seat. For that
mercy-seat never sent forth a voice like this, but spake much of
lesser things, of wars and such peace as is here below: but this
speaks all about heaven and the life to come, and things new and
that pass understanding. And having said,</p>

an holy kiss,” he added, “All the saints salute you.”</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxx-p17">By this also giving them good hopes. He has added
this in the place of the kiss, knitting them together by the
salutation, for the words also proceed from the same mouth from
which the kiss. Seest thou how he brings them all together, both
those who are widely separated in the body and those who are near,
these by the kiss and those by the written message?</p>

united them to one other by the salutations and the kisses, he
again closes his speech with prayer, with much carefulness uniting
them unto God also. Where now are they who say that because the
Holy Spirit is not inserted in the beginnings of the Epistles, He
is not of the same substance? For, behold, he hath now enumerated
Him with the Father and Son. And besides this, one may remark,
that when writing to the Colossians and saying, “Grace to you,

added not, as in all his Epistles, and 
<pb n="419" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_419.html" id="v.xxx-Page_419" />from the Lord Jesus Christ.<note place="end" n="1056" id="v.xxx-p19.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxx-p20"> See also Chrys. on Coloss. Oxford Trans. 183.
‘From God, saith he, our Father: although he useth not in this
place the name of Christ.’ Yet the Rec. Text has the words,
<scripRef passage="Col. i. 2" id="v.xxx-p20.1" parsed="|Col|1|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Col.1.2">Col. i. 2</scripRef>.</p></note>  Is then
the Son not of the same substance either, because of this? Nay,
these reasonings are of extreme folly. For this very thing
especially shows Him to be of the same substance, that Paul useth
the expression [or not] indifferently. And that what is here said
is no conjecture, hear how he mentions Son and Spirit, and is quite
silent of the Father. For, writing to the Corinthians, he says,
“But ye were washed, but ye were sanctified, but ye were
justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and in the Spirit
of our God.” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. vi. 11" id="v.xxx-p20.2" parsed="|1Cor|6|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.6.11">1
Cor. vi. 11</scripRef>.) What
then, tell me? were these not baptized into the Father? Then
assuredly they were neither washed nor sanctified. But did they
baptize them? doubtless then just as also they did baptize. How
then did he not say, ‘Ye are washed in the name of the
Father?’ Because it was indifferent in his view, at one time to
make mention of this, at another of that Person; and you may
observe this custom in many places of the Epistles. For writing
to the Romans he says, “I beseech you therefore by the mercies of
God,” (<scripRef passage="Rom. xii. 1" id="v.xxx-p20.3" parsed="|Rom|12|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.12.1">Rom. xii. 1</scripRef>.) although those mercies are
of the Son; and, “I beseech you by the love of the Spirit,”
(<scripRef passage="Rom. xv. 30" id="v.xxx-p20.4" parsed="|Rom|15|30|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.15.30">Rom. xv. 30</scripRef>.) although love is of
the Father. Wherefore then mentioned he not the Son in “the
mercies,” nor the Father in “the love?” Because as being
things plain and admitted, he was silent about them. Moreover, he
will be found again, to put the gifts also themselves
transposedly.<note place="end" n="1057" id="v.xxx-p20.5"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxx-p21"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxx-p21.1">ἀ</span><span class="Greek" id="v.xxx-p21.2">ντιστρόφως</span>.</p></note>  For having said here, “The grace of Christ, and the love of God and
the Father, and the communion of the Holy Ghost;” he in another
place speaks of “the communion of the Son,” and of “the love
of the Spirit.” For, “I beseech you,” he says, “by the
love of the Spirit.” (<scripRef passage="Rom. xv. 30" id="v.xxx-p21.3" parsed="|Rom|15|30|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.15.30">Rom. xv. 30</scripRef>.) And in his Epistle to the
Corinthians, “God is faithful, by Whom ye were called into the
communion of His Son.” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. i. 9" id="v.xxx-p21.4" parsed="|1Cor|1|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.1.9">1 Cor. i. 9</scripRef>.) Thus the things of the
Trinity are undivided: and whereas the communion is of the
Spirit, it hath been found of the Son; and whereas the grace is of
the Son, it is also of the Father and of the Holy Spirit; for [we
read], “Grace be to you from God the Father.” And in another
place, having enumerated many forms of it, he added, “But all
these worketh the one and the same Spirit, dividing to each one
severally as He will.” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. xii. 11" id="v.xxx-p21.5" parsed="|1Cor|12|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.12.11">1 Cor. xii. 11</scripRef>.) And I say these
things, not confounding<note place="end" n="1058" id="v.xxx-p21.6"><p class="endnote" id="v.xxx-p22"> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.xxx-p22.1">συναλείφων</span>.</p></note> the Persons, (away with the

and the Unity of the Substance.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxx-p24">[4.] Let us then continue both to hold these
doctrines in their strictness, and to draw to us the love of God.
For before indeed He loved us when hating Him, and reconciled us
who were His enemies; but henceforth He wishes to love us as loving
Him. Let us then continue to love Him, so that we may be also
loved by Him. For if when beloved by powerful men we are
formidable to all, much more when [beloved] by God. And should it
be needful to give wealth, or body, or even life itself for this
love, let us not grudge them. For it is not enough to say in
words that we love, but we ought to give also the proof of deeds;
for neither did He show love by words only, but by deeds also. Do
thou then also show this by thy deeds and do those things which
please Him, for so shalt thou thyself reap again the advantage.
For He needeth nothing that we have to bestow, and this is also a
special proof of a sincere love, when one who needeth nothing and
is not in any necessity, doth all for the sake of being loved by
us.  Wherefore also Moses said, “For what doth the Lord God
require of you, but to love Him, and that thou shouldest be ready
to walk after Him?” (<scripRef passage="Deut. x. 12" id="v.xxx-p24.1" parsed="|Deut|10|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Deut.10.12">Deut. x. 12</scripRef>.) So that when He biddeth
thee love Him, He then most of all showeth that He loves thee.
For nothing doth so secure our salvation as to love Him. See
then, how that all His commandments even tend together to our
repose and salvation and good report. For when he says,
“Blessed are the merciful, blessed are the pure in heart, blessed
are the meek, blessed are the poor in spirit, blessed are the
peacemakers;” (<scripRef passage="Matt. v. 3-9" id="v.xxx-p24.2" parsed="|Matt|5|3|5|9" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.3-Matt.5.9">Matt. v.
3–9</scripRef>.) He Himself indeed
reaps no advantage from these, but he enjoins them for our adorning
and attuning; and when He says, “I was an hungred,” it is not
as needing that ministry from us, but as exciting thee to
humanity. For He was well able even without thee to feed the poor
man; but as bestowing upon thee an exceeding treasure, he laid
these commands upon thee. For if the sun, which is but a
creature, needeth not our eyes; for he abideth in his own proper
brightness, even though none should look upon him, and we it is who
are the gainers when we enjoy his beams; much more is this so with
God. But that thou mayest learn this in yet another way; how
great wilt thou have the distance to be between God and us? as
great as between gnats and us, or much greater? Quite plainly it
is much greater, yea, infinite. If then we vainglorious creatures
need not service nor honor from gnats, much rather the Divine
Nature [none from us], seeing It is impassible and needing
nothing. The measure of that which He enjoyeth by us is but the
greatness of our benefit, and the delight He taketh in our
salvation. For this reason He 
<pb n="420" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf112/Page_420.html" id="v.xxx-Page_420" />also oftentimes relinquisheth His own, and
seeketh thine. “For if any,” he saith,” have a wife that
believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not
put her away;” (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. vii. 12" id="v.xxx-p24.3" parsed="|1Cor|7|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.7.12">1 Cor.
vii. 12</scripRef>.) and, “He that
putteth away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth
her to commit adultery.” Seest thou what unspeakable
goodness? ‘If a wife be a harlot,’ He says, ‘I do not
compel the husband to live with her; and if she be an unbeliever, I
do not forbid him.’ Again, ‘if thou be grieved against any
one, I command him that hath grieved thee to leave My gift and to
run to thee.’ For He saith, “If thou art offering thy gift,
and there remember that thy brother hath aught against thee, leave
thy gift before the altar, and go thy way, first be reconciled to
thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.” (<scripRef passage="Matt. v. 23, 24" id="v.xxx-p24.4" parsed="|Matt|5|23|5|24" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.23-Matt.5.24">Matt. v. 23, 24</scripRef>.) And what saith the parable
of him that had devoured his all? (<scripRef passage="Matt. xviii. 24" id="v.xxx-p24.5" parsed="|Matt|18|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.18.24">Matt. xviii. 24</scripRef>, &amp;c.) Doth it not show
this? For when he had eaten up those ten thousand talents, He had
mercy on him, and let him go; but when he demanded of his
fellowservant an hundred pence, he both called him wicked and
delivered him over to the punishment. So great account doth He
make of thy ease. The barbarian was about to sin against the wife
of the just man, and He says, “I spared thee from sinning against
me.” (<scripRef passage="Gen. xx. 6" id="v.xxx-p24.6" parsed="|Gen|20|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.20.6">Gen. xx. 6</scripRef>.) Paul persecuted the
Apostles, and He saith to him, “Why persecutest thou Me?”
Others are hungry, and He Himself saith He is an hungred, and
wanders about naked and a stranger, wishing to shame thee, and so
to force thee into the way of almsgiving.</p>

<p class="c19" id="v.xxx-p25">Reflecting then upon the love, how great He hath
shown in all things, and still shows it to be, both having
vouchsafed to make Himself known to us, (which is the greatest
crown of good things, and light to the understanding and
instruction in virtue,) and to lay down laws for the best mode of
life, and having done all things for our sakes, having given His
Son, and promised a kingdom, and invited us to those unspeakable
good things, and prepared for us a most blessed life, let us do and
say every thing so as both to appear worthy of His love and to
obtain the good things to come; whereunto may we all attain,
through the grace and love towards men of our Lord Jesus Christ;
with Whom to the Father, with the Holy Spirit, be glory now and
ever, and world without end. Amen.</p>
